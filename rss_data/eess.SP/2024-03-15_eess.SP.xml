      <title>Asymptotically Near-Optimal Hybrid Beamforming for mmWave IRS-Aided MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid beamforming is an emerging technology for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to the advantages of lower complexity, cost, and power consumption. Recently, intelligent reflection surface (IRS) has been proposed as the cost-effective technique for robust millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Thus, it is required to jointly optimize a reflection vector and hybrid beamforming matrices for IRS-aided mmWave MIMO systems. Due to the lack of RF chain in the IRS, it is unavailable to acquire the TX-IRS and IRS-RX channels separately. Instead, there are efficient methods to estimate the so-called effective (or cascaded) channel in literature. We for the first time derive the near-optimal solution of the aforementioned joint optimization only using the effective channel. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop the practical reflection vector and hybrid beamforming matrices by projecting the asymptotic solution into the modulus constraint. Via simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed construction can outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, where the latter even requires the knowledge of the TX-IRS ad IRS-RX channels separately. Furthermore, our construction can provide the robustness for channel estimation errors, which is inevitable for practical massive MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>A Robust Semantic Communication System for Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications have gained significant attention as a promising approach to address the transmission bottleneck, especially with the continuous development of 6G techniques. Distinct from the well investigated physical channel impairments, this paper focuses on semantic impairments in image, particularly those arising from adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we propose a novel metric for quantifying the intensity of semantic impairment and develop a semantic impairment dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a deep learning enabled semantic communication system, termed as DeepSC-RI, to enhance the robustness of image transmission, which incorporates a multi-scale semantic extractor with a dual-branch architecture for extracting semantics with varying granularity, thereby improving the robustness of the system. The fine-grained branch incorporates a semantic importance evaluation module to identify and prioritize crucial semantics, while the coarse-grained branch adopts a hierarchical approach for capturing the robust semantics. These two streams of semantics are seamlessly integrated via an advanced cross-attention-based semantic fusion module. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DeepSC-RI under various levels of semantic impairment intensity.</description>

      <title>Near-Field EM-Based Multistatic Radar Range Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar targets are traditionally modelled as point target reflectors, even in the near-field region. Yet, for radar systems operating at high carrier frequencies and small distances, traditional radar propagation models do not accurately model the scatterer responses. In this paper, a novel electromagnetic-based model is thus developed for the multistatic radar detection of a rectangular plate reflector in the near-field region. This model is applied to an automotive scenario, in which a linear antenna array is spread out at the front of a vehicle, and performs a radar measurement of the distance to the back of the vehicle ahead. Based on the developed received signal model, the maximum likelihood estimator of the range is designed. By exploiting the near-field target model, this estimator is shown to provide a significant gain with respect to traditional range estimators. The impact of the system and scenario parameters, i.e. the carrier frequency, bandwidth and distance to the target, is furthermore evaluated. This analysis shows that the radar resolution in the near-field regime is improved at high carrier frequencies, while saturating to the traditional bandwidth-dependent resolution in the far-field region.</description>

      <title>CRB Analysis for Mixed-ADC Based DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mixed analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based architecture consisting of high-precision and one-bit ADCs with the antenna-varying threshold for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation using a uniform linear array (ULA), which utilizes fixed but different thresholds for one-bit ADCs across different receive antennas. The Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound (CRB) with the antenna-varying threshold is obtained. Then based on the lower bound of the CRB, we derive the asymptotic CRB of the DOA, which depends on the placement of mixed-ADC. Our analysis shows that distributing high-precision ADCs evenly around the two edges of the ULA yields improved performance. This result can be extended to a more general case where the ULA is equipped with two types of ADCs with different quantization precisions. To efficiently obtain the maximum likelihood DOA estimates, we propose a two-step algorithm. Firstly, we formulate the model as a sparse signal representation problem, and modify the sparse learning via iterative minimization (SLIM) approach to the mixed-ADC based DOA estimation. In the second step, we use the relaxation-based approach to cyclically refine the estimates of SLIM, further enhancing the DOA estimation performance. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the CRB analysis and the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Radar Rainbow Beams For Wideband mmWave Communication: Beam Training And Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that leverages sensing to assist communication, ensuring fast initial access, seamless user tracking, and uninterrupted communication for millimeter wave (mmWave) wideband systems. True-time-delayers (TTDs) are utilized to generate frequency-dependent radar rainbow beams by controlling the beam squint effect. These beams cover users across the entire angular space simultaneously for fast beam training using just one orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol. Three detection and estimation schemes are proposed based on radar rainbow beams for estimation of the users' angles, distances, and velocities, which are then exploited for communication beamformer design. The first proposed scheme utilizes a single-antenna radar receiver and one set of rainbow beams, but may cause a Doppler ambiguity. To tackle this limitation, two additional schemes are introduced, utilizing two sets of rainbow beams and a multi-antenna receiver, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed detection and estimation schemes are extended to realize user tracking by choosing different subsets of OFDM subcarriers. This approach eliminates the need to switch phase shifters and TTDs, which are typically necessary in existing tracking technologies, thereby reducing the demands on the control circurity. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed rainbow beam-based training and tracking methods for mobile users. Notably, the scheme employing a multi-antenna radar receiver can accurately estimate the channel parameters and can support communication rates comparable to those achieved with perfect channel information.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter aims to provide a fundamental analytical comparison for the two major types of relaying methods: intelligent reflecting surfaces and full-duplex relays, particularly focusing on unmanned aerial vehicle communication scenarios. Both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying schemes are included in the comparison. In addition, optimal 3D UAV deployment and minimum transmit power under the quality of service constraint are derived. Our numerical results show that IRSs of medium size exhibit comparable performance to AF relays, meanwhile outperforming DF relays under extremely large surface size and high data rates.</description>

      <title>Delay Dispersion in IRS-assisted FSO Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The line-of-sight (LOS) requirement of free-space optical (FSO) systems can be relaxed by employing optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). In this paper, we model the impact of the IRS-induced delay dispersion and derive the channel impulse response (CIR) of IRS-assisted FSO links. The proposed model takes into account the characteristics of the incident and reflected beams' wavefronts, the position of transmitter and receiver, the size of the IRS, and the incident beamwidth on the IRS. Our simulation results reveal that a maximum effective delay spread of 0.7 ns is expected for a square IRS with area 1 $\mathrm{m}^2$, which induces inter-symbol interference for bit rates larger than 10 Gbps. We show that the IRS-induced delay dispersion can be mitigated via equalization at the receiver.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Modeling for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empowered by the latest progress on innovative metamaterials/metasurfaces and advanced antenna technologies, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (H-MIMO) emerges as a promising technology to fulfill the extreme goals of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. The antenna arrays utilized in H-MIMO comprise massive (possibly to extreme extent) numbers of antenna elements, densely spaced less than half-a-wavelength and integrated into a compact space, realizing an almost continuous aperture. Thanks to the expected low cost, size, weight, and power consumption, such apertures are expected to be largely fabricated for near-field communications. In addition, the physical features of H-MIMO enable manipulations directly on the electromagnetic (EM) wave domain and spatial multiplexing. To fully leverage this potential, near-field H-MIMO channel modeling, especially from the EM perspective, is of paramount significance. In this article, we overview near-field H-MIMO channel models elaborating on the various modeling categories and respective features, as well as their challenges and evaluation criteria. We also present EM-domain channel models that address the inherit computational and measurement complexities. Finally, the article is concluded with a set of future research directions on the topic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study considers the Block-Toeplitz structural properties inherent in traditional multichannel forward model matrices, using Full Matrix Capture (FMC) in ultrasonic testing as a case study. We propose an analytical convolutional forward model that transforms reflectivity maps into FMC data. Our findings demonstrate that the convolutional model excels over its matrix-based counterpart in terms of computational efficiency and storage requirements. This accelerated forward modeling approach holds significant potential for various inverse problems, notably enhancing Sparse Signal Recovery (SSR) within the context LASSO regression, which facilitates efficient Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) algorithms. Additionally, we explore the integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the forward model, employing deep unfolding to implement the Learned Block Convolutional ISTA (BC-LISTA).</description>

      <title>Angle estimation using mmWave RSS measurements with enhanced multipath information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: mmWave communication has come up as the unexplored spectrum for 5G services. With new standards for 5G NR positioning, more off-the-shelf platforms and algorithms are needed to perform indoor positioning. An object can be accurately positioned in a room either by using an angle and a delay estimate or two angle estimates or three delay estimates. We propose an algorithm to jointly estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD), based only on the received signal strength (RSS). We use mm-FLEX, an experimentation platform developed by IMDEA Networks Institute that can perform real-time signal processing for experimental validation of our proposed algorithm. Codebook-based beampatterns are used with a uniquely placed multi-antenna array setup to enhance the reception of multipath components and we obtain an AoA estimate per receiver thereby overcoming the line-of-sight (LoS) limitation of RSS-based localization systems. We further validate the results from measurements by emulating the setup with a simple ray-tracing approach.</description>

      <title>Handoffs in User-Centric Cell-Free MIMO Networks: A POMDP Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of managing handoffs (HOs) in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) networks. Motivated by the importance of controlling the number of HOs and by the correlation between efficient HO decisions and the temporal evolution of the channel conditions, we formulate a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with the state space representing the discrete versions of the large-scale fading and the action space representing the association decisions of the user with the access points (APs). We develop a novel algorithm that employs this model to derive a HO policy for a mobile user based on current and future rewards. To alleviate the high complexity of our POMDP, we follow a divide-and-conquer approach by breaking down the POMDP formulation into sub-problems, each solved separately. Then, the policy and the candidate pool of APs for the sub-problem that produced the best total expected reward are used to perform HOs within a specific time horizon. We then introduce modifications to our algorithm to decrease the number of HOs. The results show that half of the number of HOs in the UC-mMIMO networks can be eliminated. Namely, our novel solution can control the number of HOs while maintaining a rate guarantee, where a 47%-70% reduction of the cumulative number of HOs is observed in networks with a density of 125 APs per km2. Most importantly, our results show that a POMDP-based HO scheme is promising to control HOs.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of higher data rates and efficient spectrum utilization in modern communication technologies necessitates novel solutions. In order to provide insights into improving spectral efficiency and reducing latency, this study investigates the maximum channel coding rate (MCCR) of finite block length (FBL) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) channels. By optimizing power allocation, we derive the system's MCCR expression. Simulation results are compared with the existing literature to reveal the benefits of FTN in FBL transmission.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning-Based Fronthaul Compression for Cloud Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fronthaul compression problem in a user-centric cloud radio access network, in which single-antenna users are served by a central processor (CP) cooperatively via a cluster of remote radio heads (RRHs). To satisfy the fronthaul capacity constraint, this paper proposes a transform-compress-forward scheme, which consists of well-designed transformation matrices and uniform quantizers. The transformation matrices perform dimension reduction in the uplink and dimension expansion in the downlink. To reduce the communication overhead for designing the transformation matrices, this paper further proposes a deep learning framework to first learn a suboptimal transformation matrix at each RRH based on the local channel state information (CSI), and then to refine it iteratively. To facilitate the refinement process, we propose an efficient signaling scheme that only requires the transmission of low-dimensional effective CSI and its gradient between the CP and RRH, and further, a meta-learning based gated recurrent unit network to reduce the number of signaling transmission rounds. For the sum-rate maximization problem, simulation results show that the proposed two-stage neural network can perform close to the fully cooperative global CSI based benchmark with significantly reduced communication overhead for both the uplink and the downlink. Moreover, using the first stage alone can already outperform the existing local CSI based benchmark.</description>

      <title>Smart Resource Allocation at mmWave/THz Frequencies with Cooperative Rate-Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose algorithms to minimize the energy consumption in millimeter wave/terahertz multi-user downlink communication systems. To ensure coverage in blockage-vulnerable high frequency systems, we consider cooperative rate-splitting (CRS) and transmission over multiple time blocks, where via CRS, multiple users cooperate to assist a blocked user. Moreover, we show that transmission over multiple time blocks provides benefits through smart resource allocation. We first propose a communication framework named improved distinct extraction-based CRS (iDeCRS) that utilizes the benefits of rate-splitting. With our transmission framework, we derive a performance benchmark assuming genie channel state information (CSI), i.e., the channels of the present and future time blocks are known, denoted as GENIE. Using the results from GENIE, we derive a novel efficiency constrained optimization (ECO) algorithm assuming instantaneous CSI. In addition, a simple but effective even data transmission (EDT) algorithm that promotes steady transmission along the time blocks is proposed. Simulation results show that ECO and EDT have satisfactory performances compared to GENIE. The results also show that ECO outperforms EDT when many users are cooperating, and vise versa.</description>

      <title>Microwave photonic transversal filters based on microcombs with feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback control plays a crucial role in improving system accuracy and stability for a variety of scientific and engineering applications. Here, we theoretically and experimentally investigate the implementation of feedback control in microwave photonic (MWP) transversal filter systems based on optical microcomb sources, which offer advantages in achieving highly reconfigurable processing functions without requiring changes to hardware. We propose four different feedback control methods including (1) one stage spectral power reshaping, (2) one stage impulse response reshaping, (3) two stage spectral power reshaping, and (4) two stage synergic spectral power reshaping and impulse response reshaping. We experimentally implement these feedback control methods and compare their performance. The results show that the feedback control can significantly improve not only the accuracy of comb line shaping as well as temporal signal processing and spectral filtering, but also the systems long term stability. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and future prospects for optimizing feedback control in microcomb based MWP transversal filter systems implemented by both discrete components and integrated chips. Our results provide a comprehensive guide for the implementation of feedback control in microcomb based MWP filter systems in order to improve their performance for practical applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a dual-polarization radio frequency (RF) channelizer based on microcombs. With the tailored mismatch between the FSRs of the active and passive MRRs, wideband RF spectra can be channelized into multiple segments featuring digital compatible bandwidths via the Vernier effect. Due to the use of dual polarization states, the number of channelized spectral segments, and thus the RF instantaneous bandwidth (with a certain spectral resolution), can be doubled. In our experiments, we used 20 microcomb lines with 49 GHz FSR to achieve 20 channels for each polarization, with high RF spectra slicing resolutions at 144 MHz (TE) and 163 MHz (TM), respectively; achieving an instantaneous RF operation bandwidth of 3.1 GHz (TE) and 2.2 GHz (TM). Our approach paves the path towards monolithically integrated photonic RF receivers (the key components active and passive MRRs are all fabricated on the same platform) with reduced complexity, size, and unprecedented performance, which is important for wide RF applications with digital compatible signal detection.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis on RIS-Aided Wideband Massive MIMO OFDM Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wideband massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Frequency-selective Rician fading channels are considered, and the OFDM data transmission process is presented in time domain. This paper derives the closed-form approximate expression of the uplink achievable rate, based on which the asymptotic system performance is analyzed when the number of the antennas at the base station and the number of reflecting elements at the RIS grow to infinity. Besides, the power scaling laws of the considered system are revealed to provide energy-saving insights. Furthermore, this paper proposes a gradient ascent-based algorithm to design the phase shifts of the RIS for maximizing the minimum user rate. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the correctness of analytical conclusions and draw insights.</description>

      <title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Autonomous Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a prospective wireless technology that enhances wireless channel quality. An RIS is often equipped with passive array of elements and provides cost and power-efficient solutions for coverage extension of wireless communication systems. Without any radio frequency (RF) chains or computing resources, however, the RIS requires control information to be sent to it from an external unit, e.g., a base station (BS). The control information can be delivered by wired or wireless channels, and the BS must be aware of the RIS and the RIS-related channel conditions in order to effectively configure its behavior. Recent works have introduced hybrid RIS structures possessing a few active elements that can sense and digitally process received data. Here, we propose the operation of an entirely autonomous RIS that operates without a control link between the RIS and BS. Using a few sensing elements, the autonomous RIS employs a deep Q network (DQN) based on reinforcement learning in order to enhance the sum rate of the network. Our results illustrate the potential of deploying autonomous RISs in wireless networks with essentially no network overhead.</description>

      <title>Static Grouping Strategy Design for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) extends conventional RIS through novel architectures, such as group-connected RIS, with scattering matrix not restricted to being diagonal. However, it remains unexplored how to optimally group the elements in group-connected RISs to maximize the performance while maintaining a low-complexity circuit. In this study, we propose and model BD-RIS with a static grouping strategy optimized based on the channel statistics. After formulating the corresponding problems, we design the grouping in single- and multi-user systems. Numerical results reveal the benefits of grouping optimization, i.e., up to 60% sum rate improvement, especially in highly correlated channels.</description>

      <title>Joint Port Selection and Beamforming Design for Fluid Antenna Assisted Integrated Data and Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) has been of fundamental importance for providing both wireless data transfer (WDT) and wireless energy transfer (WET) services towards low-power devices. Fluid antenna (FA) is capable of exploiting the huge spatial diversity of the wireless channel to enhance the receive signal strength, which is more suitable for the tiny-size low-power devices having the IDET requirements. In this letter, a multiuser FA assisted IDET system is studied and the weighted energy harvesting power at energy receivers (ERs) is maximized by jointly optimizing the port selection and transmit beamforming design under imperfect channel state information (CSI), while the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each data receiver (DR) is satisfied. An efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solutions for the non-convex problem. Simulation results evaluate the performance of the FA-IDET system, while also demonstrate that FA outperforms the multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) counterpart in terms of the IDET performance, as long as the port number is large enough.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization With Across-Task Transferable Max-Value Entropy Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications, ranging from logistics to engineering, a designer is faced with a sequence of optimization tasks for which the objectives are in the form of black-box functions that are costly to evaluate. For example, the designer may need to tune the hyperparameters of neural network models for different learning tasks over time. Rather than evaluating the objective function for each candidate solution, the designer may have access to approximations of the objective functions, for which higher-fidelity evaluations entail a larger cost. Existing multi-fidelity black-box optimization strategies select candidate solutions and fidelity levels with the goal of maximizing the information accrued about the optimal value or solution for the current task. Assuming that successive optimization tasks are related, this paper introduces a novel information-theoretic acquisition function that balances the need to acquire information about the current task with the goal of collecting information transferable to future tasks. The proposed method includes shared inter-task latent variables, which are transferred across tasks by implementing particle-based variational Bayesian updates. Experimental results across synthetic and real-world examples reveal that the proposed provident acquisition strategy that caters to future tasks can significantly improve the optimization efficiency as soon as a sufficient number of tasks is processed.</description>

      <title>Localization in Digital Twin MIMO Networks: A Case for Massive Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization in outdoor wireless systems typically requires transmitting specific reference signals to estimate distance (trilateration methods) or angle (triangulation methods). These cause overhead on communication, need a LoS link to work well, and require multiple base stations, often imposing synchronization or specific hardware requirements. Fingerprinting has none of these drawbacks, but building its database requires high human effort to collect real-world measurements. For a long time, this issue limited the size of databases and thus their performance. This work proposes significantly reducing human effort in building fingerprinting databases by populating them with \textit{digital twin RF maps}. These RF maps are built from ray-tracing simulations on a digital replica of the environment across several frequency bands and beamforming configurations. Online user fingerprints are then matched against this spatial database. The approach was evaluated with practical simulations using realistic propagation models and user measurements. Our experiments show sub-meter localization errors on a NLoS location 95\% of the time using sensible user measurement report sizes. Results highlight the promising potential of the proposed digital twin approach for ubiquitous wide-area 6G localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation aims to extract the load profiles of individual consumer electronic appliances, given an aggregate load profile of the mains of a smart home. This work proposes a novel deep-learning and edge computing approach to solve the NILM problem and a few related problems as follows. 1) We build upon the reputed seq2-point convolutional neural network (CNN) model to come up with the proposed seq2-[3]-point CNN model to solve the (home) NILM problem and site-NILM problem (basically, NILM at a smaller scale). 2) We solve the related problem of appliance identification by building upon the state-of-the-art (pre-trained) 2D-CNN models, i.e., AlexNet, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121, which are fine-tuned two custom datasets that consist of Wavelets and short-time Fourier transform (STFT)-based 2D electrical signatures of the appliances. 3) Finally, we do some basic qualitative inference about an individual appliance's health by comparing the power consumption of the same appliance across multiple homes. Low-frequency REDD dataset is used for all problems, except site-NILM where REFIT dataset has been used. As for the results, we achieve a maximum accuracy of 94.6\% for home-NILM, 81\% for site-NILM, and 88.9\% for appliance identification (with Resnet-based model).</description>

      <title>Model-free Reinforcement Learning of Semantic Communication by Stochastic Policy Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the recent success of Machine Learning tools in wireless communications, the idea of semantic communication by Weaver from 1949 has gained attention. It breaks with Shannon's classic design paradigm by aiming to transmit the meaning, i.e., semantics, of a message instead of its exact version, allowing for information rate savings. In this work, we apply the Stochastic Policy Gradient (SPG) to design a semantic communication system by reinforcement learning, separating transmitter and receiver, and not requiring a known or differentiable channel model -- a crucial step towards deployment in practice. Further, we derive the use of SPG for both classic and semantic communication from the maximization of the mutual information between received and target variables. Numerical results show that our approach achieves comparable performance to a model-aware approach based on the reparametrization trick, albeit with a decreased convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a mobile edge computing (MEC) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is used to alleviate the attenuation of communication links during computational offloading. In this paradigm, the dual function radar and communication (DFRC)-enabled user equipments (UEs) simultaneously perform radar sensing and communication tasks, facilitating the offloading of partial computational tasks to an edge computing server (ECS) through an RIS. To satisfy the critical need for time-efficient sensing, we investigate the latency minimization problem for both single-UE and multi-UE scenarios, subject to constraints on UEs' transmit power, radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR), RIS phase shift, and computation capability. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to decouple the original problem into two subproblems, where the computational and beamforming settings are optimized alternately. Specifically, we employ the Lagrangian method for the optimization of computational settings. In addition, two equivalent transformations are applied to transform the objective function (OF) of the subproblem for active and passive beamforming into a form of weighted sum-rate. Then, a combination of minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), successive convex approximation (SCA), majorization-minimization (MM), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) techniques are applied to tackle this subproblem. Moreover, a closed-form solution is obtained in the simplified single UE scenario. Finally, simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed system.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware and Reliable Neural MIMO Receivers via Modular Bayesian Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is envisioned to play a key role in the design of future wireless receivers. A popular approach to design learning-aided receivers combines deep neural networks (DNNs) with traditional model-based receiver algorithms, realizing hybrid model-based data-driven architectures. Such architectures typically include multiple modules, each carrying out a different functionality dictated by the model-based receiver workflow. Conventionally trained DNN-based modules are known to produce poorly calibrated, typically overconfident, decisions. Consequently, incorrect decisions may propagate through the architecture without any indication of their insufficient accuracy. To address this problem, we present a novel combination of Bayesian deep learning with hybrid model-based data-driven architectures for wireless receiver design. The proposed methodology, referred to as modular Bayesian deep learning, is designed to yield calibrated modules, which in turn improves both accuracy and calibration of the overall receiver. We specialize this approach for two fundamental tasks in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers - equalization and decoding. In the presence of scarce data, the ability of modular Bayesian deep learning to produce reliable uncertainty measures is consistently shown to directly translate into improved performance of the overall MIMO receiver chain.</description>

      <title>X-CANIDS: Signal-Aware Explainable Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Network-Based In-Vehicle Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controller Area Network (CAN) is an essential networking protocol that connects multiple electronic control units (ECUs) in a vehicle. However, CAN-based in-vehicle networks (IVNs) face security risks owing to the CAN mechanisms. An adversary can sabotage a vehicle by leveraging the security risks if they can access the CAN bus. Thus, recent actions and cybersecurity regulations (e.g., UNR 155) require carmakers to implement intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in their vehicles. The IDS should detect cyberattacks and provide additional information to analyze conducted attacks. Although many IDSs have been proposed, considerations regarding their feasibility and explainability remain lacking. This study proposes X-CANIDS, which is a novel IDS for CAN-based IVNs. X-CANIDS dissects the payloads in CAN messages into human-understandable signals using a CAN database. The signals improve the intrusion detection performance compared with the use of bit representations of raw payloads. These signals also enable an understanding of which signal or ECU is under attack. X-CANIDS can detect zero-day attacks because it does not require any labeled dataset in the training phase. We confirmed the feasibility of the proposed method through a benchmark test on an automotive-grade embedded device with a GPU. The results of this work will be valuable to carmakers and researchers considering the installation of in-vehicle IDSs for their vehicles.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Regularization on Magnitude with Deep Priors for 3D Near-Field MIMO Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-field radar imaging systems are used in a wide range of applications such as concealed weapon detection and medical diagnosis. In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing the three-dimensional (3D) complex-valued reflectivity distribution of the near-field scene by enforcing regularization on its magnitude. We solve this inverse problem by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. For this, we provide a general expression for the proximal mapping associated with such regularization functionals. This equivalently corresponds to the solution of a complex-valued denoising problem which involves regularization on the magnitude. By utilizing this expression, we develop a novel and efficient plug-and-play (PnP) reconstruction method that consists of simple update steps. Due to the success of data-adaptive deep priors in imaging, we also train a 3D deep denoiser to exploit within the developed PnP framework. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) imaging under various compressive and noisy observation scenarios using both simulated and experimental data. The performance is also compared with the commonly used direct inversion and sparsity-based reconstruction approaches. The results demonstrate that the developed technique not only provides state-of-the-art performance for 3D real-world targets, but also enables fast computation. Our approach provides a unified general framework to effectively handle arbitrary regularization on the magnitude of a complex-valued unknown and is equally applicable to other radar image formation problems (including SAR).</description>

      <title>D$^2$-JSCC: Digital Deep Joint Source-channel Coding for Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SemCom) have emerged as a new paradigm for supporting sixth-generation applications, where semantic features of data are transmitted using artificial intelligence algorithms to attain high communication efficiencies. Most existing SemCom techniques utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) to implement analog source-channel mappings, which are incompatible with existing digital communication architectures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework of digital deep joint source-channel coding (D$^2$-JSCC) targeting image transmission in SemCom. The framework features digital source and channel codings that are jointly optimized to reduce the end-to-end (E2E) distortion. First, deep source coding with an adaptive density model is designed to encode semantic features according to their distributions. Second, digital channel coding is employed to protect encoded features against channel distortion. To facilitate their joint design, the E2E distortion is characterized as a function of the source and channel rates via the analysis of the Bayesian model and Lipschitz assumption on the DNNs. Then to minimize the E2E distortion, a two-step algorithm is proposed to control the source-channel rates for a given channel signal-to-noise ratio. Simulation results reveal that the proposed framework outperforms classic deep JSCC and mitigates the cliff and leveling-off effects, which commonly exist for separation-based approaches.</description>

Abstract: The development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has brought about comprehensive urban traffic information that not only provides convenience to urban residents in their daily lives but also enhances the efficiency of urban road usage, leading to a more harmonious and sustainable urban life. Typical scenarios in ITS mainly include traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. However, most current ITS applications rely on a centralized training approach where users upload source data to a cloud server with high computing power for management and centralized training. This approach has limitations such as poor real-time performance, data silos, and difficulty in guaranteeing data privacy. To address these limitations, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the application of FL in ITS, with a particular focus on three key scenarios: traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. For each scenario, we provide an in-depth analysis of its key characteristics, current challenges, and specific manners in which FL is leveraged. Moreover, we discuss the benefits that FL can offer as a potential solution to the limitations of the centralized training approach currently used in ITS applications.</description>

Abstract: How to decode human vision through neural signals has attracted a long-standing interest in neuroscience and machine learning. Modern contrastive learning and generative models improved the performance of fMRI-based visual decoding and reconstruction. However, the high cost and low temporal resolution of fMRI limit their applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), prompting a high need for EEG-based visual reconstruction. In this study, we present an EEG-based visual reconstruction framework. It consists of a plug-and-play EEG encoder called the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM), which is aligned with image embeddings, and a two-stage EEG guidance image generator that first transforms EEG features into image priors and then reconstructs the visual stimuli with a pre-trained image generator. Our approach allows EEG embeddings to achieve superior performance in image classification and retrieval tasks. Our two-stage image generation strategy vividly reconstructs images seen by humans. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of signals from different time windows and brain regions on decoding and reconstruction. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data modality. We report that EEG-based visual decoding achieves SOTA performance, highlighting the portability, low cost, and high temporal resolution of EEG, enabling a wide range of BCI applications. The code of ATM is available at https://github.com/dongyangli-del/EEG_Image_decode.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Beam Training for Multi-RIS-Assisted Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the beam training problem in the multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system, where multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are deployed to improve the coverage and the achievable rate. However, existing beam training techniques in mmWave systems suffer from the high complexity (i.e., exponential order) and low identification accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a novel hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme that reduces the training complexity to the logarithmic order with the high accuracy. Specifically, we first design a generation mechanism for HMB codebooks. Then, we propose a demultiplexing algorithm based on the soft decision to distinguish signals from different RIS reflective links. Finally, we utilize a multi-round voting mechanism to align the beams. Simulation results show that the proposed HMB training scheme enables simultaneous training for multiple RISs and multiple users, and reduces the beam training overhead to the logarithmic level. Moreover, it also shows that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the identification accuracy by at least 20% compared to existing beam training techniques.</description>
