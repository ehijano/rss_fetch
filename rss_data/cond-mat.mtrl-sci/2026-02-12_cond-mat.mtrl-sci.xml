      <title>Semiclassical Routes to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ Scattering Continuum via Model Meta$-$Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a leading material for proximate Kitaev magnetism. We address the origin of the broad, $\Gamma$-point centered excitation continuum observed by inelastic neutron scattering at elevated temperatures in this compound. Using stochastic Landau-Lifshitz dynamics augmented with quantum-equivalent corrections, we reproduce the temperature-dependent dynamical spin structure factor across both the correlated and conventional paramagnetic regimes. A meta-analysis of 38 published exchange parameter sets identifies those most consistent with the full temperature evolution. A Bayesian optimization procedure is used to derive parameters that capture the low-energy star-like momentum dependence and the overall bandwidth of the continuum. Rescaling temperatures by the Curie--Weiss scale produces a collapse of spectral measures, demonstrating that the high-$T$ dynamics are governed by correlated paramagnetism below $\theta_{\mathrm{CW}}$ rather than by the Kitaev crossover to fractionalized excitations. Complementary 24-site exact diagonalization clarifies finite-size systematics at low temperature and the proximity to zigzag/incommensurate ordering. Beyond $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, our simulation pipeline provides a reproducible, data-driven framework to infer effective spin models in magnets that exhibit broad continua.</description>

      <title>Computational discovery of cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (RAZIBs) attract considerable scientific and commercial interest for deployment in grid-scale energy storage due to higher safety and lower manufacturing cost when compared to lithium-ion batteries. However, currently studied cathode materials suffer from severe capacity fade when cycling at rates appropriate for grid-scale applications ($&lt;$ C/2), which hampers the commercialization of RAZIBs. To address the present limitation on cathode material availability, more than 2000 previously synthesized oxides, chalcogenides, Prussian blue analogues, and polyanion materials were computationally screened for the discovery of highly stable RAZIB cathode materials. The structural, electrochemical, and chemical properties of the materials were respectively evaluated through an investigation of the available Zn$^{2+}$ percolation paths in the crystal structure, the stability of the material in aqueous media under RAZIB operation conditions, and the attained transition metal oxidation state during cycling. The transition metal oxidation state and intercalating ion coordination environment were determined to govern the magnitude of the calculated intercalation potential, with this finding directly supporting the development of batteries with high operation potentials. Finally, 10 previously unexplored materials were identified with leading metrics for operation as RAZIB cathode materials, such as high Zn$^{2+}$ (de)intercalation potential, electrochemical stability, theoretical gravimetric capacity, and energy density, being here proposed for experimental testing. The materials identified in this study demonstrate a guide for advancing the available cathode materials for RAZIB, and help expedite the establishment of RAZIB as a commercially viable technology for grid-scale energy storage.</description>

      <title>Device Applications of Heterogeneously Integrated Strain-Switched Ferrimagnets/Topological Insulator/Piezoelectric Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of ferrimagnets (CoV2O4, GdCo, TbCo) exhibits out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained compressively and in-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained expansively (or vice versa). If such a ferrimagnetic thin film is placed on top of a topological insulator (TI) thin film and its magnetic anisotropy is modulated with strain, then interfacial exchange coupling between the ferrimagnet (FM) and the underlying TI will modulate the surface current flowing through the latter. If the strain is varied continuously, the current will also vary continuously and if the strain alternates in time, the current will also alternate with the frequency of the strain modulation, as long as the frequency is not so high that the period is smaller than the switching time of the FM. If the strain is generated with a gate voltage by integrating a piezoelectric underneath the FM/TI stack, then that can implement a transconductance amplifier or a synapse for neuromorphic computation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of Massively Parallel Phase-Field Codes for Directional Solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed benchmark comparing two state-of-the-art phase-field implementations for simulating alloy solidification under experimentally relevant conditions. The study investigates the directional solidification of Al-3wt%Cu under additive manufacturing conditions and SCN-0.46wt% camphor under microgravity conditions from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) DECLIC-DSI-R experiments. Both codes, one employing finite-difference discretization with uniform mesh and GPU-acceleration and the other one employing finite-element discretization with adaptive-mesh and CPU-parallelization, solve the same quantitative phase-field formulation that incorporates an anti-trapping current for the solidification of dilute alloys. We evaluate the predictions of each code for dendritic morphology, primary spacing, and tip dynamics in both 2D and 3D, as well as their numerical convergence and computational performance. While existing benchmark problems have primarily focused on simplified or small-scale simulations, they do not reflect the computational and modeling challenges posed by employing experimentally relevant time and length scales. Our results provide a practical framework for assessing phase-field code performance as well as validating and facilitating their application in integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) workflows that require integration with realistic experimental data.</description>

      <title>Self-pinning mechanism for grain boundary stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research focused on two different mechanisms of microstructure stabilization in alloys: thermodynamic stabilization by reducing the grain boundary (GB) free energy and kinetic stabilization by suppressing the GB mobility by solute drag or embedded pinning particles. Here, we propose a new GB stabilization mechanism, called self-pinning, in which the segregation atmosphere of a moving GB spontaneously breaks into solute-rich clusters, which produce a strong pinning effect in addition to the free energy reduction resulting from the segregation. The cluster formation is caused by strong solute-solute attraction at GBs, leading to a first-order transformation between solute-lean and solute-rich GB phases. The effect is demonstrated by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations capturing segregation thermodynamics, GB dynamics, and solute diffusion. The self-pinning provides an intrinsic stabilization mechanism for suppressing grain growth that couples thermodynamics and kinetics. The mechanism obviates the need for pre-existing second phase inclusions, refocusing the alloy design on GB phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Biaxial Strain Control of Helimagnetism via Chemical Expansion in Thin Film SrFeO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate control of helimagnetic order in biaxially strained SrFeO3 thin films using neutron diffraction and resonant soft x-ray scattering. SrFeO3, a negative charge-transfer oxide, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram that includes multi-q spin structures. Tensile epitaxial strain produces a pronounced shortening of the helimagnetic ordering length and a tilting of the magnetic ordering vector. We interpret this behavior in terms of chemical expansion: lattice dilation under tensile strain lowers the energetic cost of oxygen vacancies, leading to an expanded unit cell that modifies Fe-O hybridization and enhances superexchange relative to double exchange. These results reveal how epitaxial strain can indirectly tune helimagnetism through defect-driven chemical expansion, highlighting the strong coupling between lattice, chemistry, and magnetic order in transition-metal oxides. Our findings establish chemical expansion as an effective mechanism for engineering complex magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with implications for spintronic, magnonic, and quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Excitons in van der Waals magnetic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors provide a unique materials platform in which long-range magnetic order coexists with strongly bound excitons. Because excitonic states and magnetic moments originate from the same electronic orbitals and are coupled through intrinsic exchange interactions, optical excitations in these systems exhibit pronounced sensitivity to magnetic order. Recent experiments have revealed unusually strong magneto-optical responses, as well as direct coupling between excitons and magnons, establishing new routes for controlling light-matter interactions with spin degrees of freedom. This Review surveys key developments in the field, focusing on representative material systems, experimental signatures of exciton-magnetism coupling, and the theoretical frameworks used to describe these phenomena. We conclude with perspectives on how this rapidly evolving field could enable next-generation optoelectronic and quantum technologies leveraging the coupled dynamics of light, charge, and spin.</description>

      <title>Probing Plasmonic Oscillations in 2D Moir\'e Nanocrystal Superlattices by Low-Loss EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) has been established as a powerful analytical technique for investigating the oxidation state, band structure, and dielectric properties of materials with exceptional spatial resolution. Inspired by twisted 2D materials, we utilize low-loss EELS to examine the plasmonic excitations in 2D moir\'e Au nanocrystal superlattices (NCSLs) formed by liquid-air interface self-assembly using a double-dipping method. This approach produces stacked hexagonal layers that can be twisted, forming moir\'e patterns in NCSLs whose twist angles are precisely measured via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Low-loss EELS effectively mitigates challenges arising from fabrication-induced non-uniformity and reveals a blue shift in plasmonic excitation when comparing single-layer, double-layer, and twisted configurations. This sharply contrasts with the optical spectroscopy measurements, which show an overall red shift relative to the EELS data. The high spatial resolution of STEM-EELS further demonstrates that twist-induced symmetry breaking strongly influences plasmonic behavior. Coupled dipole modeling explains the observed discrepancies: the electron beam excites out-of-plane polarization modes unavailable to optical probes, while optical measurements average over ensembles. Our findings highlight that EELS provides complementary information to optical spectroscopy for understanding how structural arrangements at the nanoscale influence collective electronic properties, advancing the design of plasmonic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Antiferroaxial altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferroaxial state is emerging as an important ferroic order in condensed matter systems. Here, we establish antiferroaxial altermagnetism as a broadly prevalent, generic, and microscopically grounded multiferroic mechanism, in which antiferroaxial counter-rotating distortions both induce altermagnetism and enable its deterministic and reversible switching. Within a unified Landau-theory and symmetry framework, we identify a symmetry-allowed trilinear invariant coupling the antiferroaxial order, the N\'{e}el vector, and the altermagnetic order, and derive general symmetry criteria for its occurrence. This coupling locks the induced altermagnetism to the antiferroaxial order, so that reversing the latter reverses the spin splitting and associated time-reversal-odd responses, such as anomalous Hall conductivity. We provide a practical spin group dictionary mapping N\'{e}el-vector representations to the resulting $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave antiferroaxial altermagnetism, validate the mechanism with ligand-rotation tight-binding models and first-principles calculations, and identify many candidate materials by screening the MAGNDATA and C2DB databases. Our results elevate antiferroaxiality to a universal ferroic control knob for structurally programmable altermagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics in magnonic Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonators: Low-power neuron-like activation and transmission suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in magnonic Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonators composed of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films coupled to CoFeB nanostripes. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we observe a systematic downshift of the spin-wave transmission gaps as the excitation power increases. This nonlinear behavior occurs at low power levels, reduced by a strong spatial concentration of spin waves within the resonator. The resulting power-dependent transmission enables neuron-like activation behavior and frequency-selective nonlinear spin-wave absorption. Our results highlight magnonic Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonators as compact low-power nonlinear elements for neuromorphic magnonic computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent antiferromagnetic Chern and axion insulating states in UOTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators have received significant interest due to their dissipationless edge states, which promise advances in energy-efficient electronic transport. However, the magnetic topological insulator state has typically been found in ferromagnets (FMs) that suffer from low magnetic ordering temperatures and stray fields. Identifying an antiferromagnetic topological insulator that exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) with a relatively high N\'eel temperature has been a longstanding challenge. Here, we focus on the recently discovered van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet (AFM) UOTe, which not only features a high N\'eel temperature (\(\sim\)150K) but also exhibits intriguing Kondo interaction and topological characteristics. Our systematic analysis of the layer-dependent topological phases based on \textit{ab} initio computations predicts the two-layer UOTe film to be an ideal 2D AFM Chern insulator in which the Hall conductivity is quantized with a fully compensated spin magnetization. By applying an in-plane strain or electric field, we show how the itinerancy of U-5f electrons can be manipulated to trigger a transition between the nontrivial ($C = 1$) and trivial ($C = 0$) phases. Interestingly, the 3-layer UOTe film is found to have zero charge conductance but it hosts a quantized spin Hall conductivity (SHC) with finite magneto-electric coupling, suggesting the presence of an axion insulator-like state. The unique magnetic structure of UOTe supports a layer-tunable topology in which films with an odd number of layers are axion-like insulators, while films with an even number of layers are Chern insulators, and the bulk material is a Dirac semimetal. Our study offers a new intrinsic AFM materials platform for realizing correlated topological phases for next-generation spintronics applications and fundamental science studies.</description>

      <title>Distorted polyhedral architecture enabled high thermoelectric performance of columnar double halide perovskites Cs2AgPdCl5 and Cs2AgPtCl5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of two newly synthesized columnar double halide perovskites Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$. These materials accommodate a distorted local polyhedral architecture with tetrahedral symmetry compared to traditional double halide perovskites. By employing density functional theory along with the semiclassical transport model, we have analyzed the electronic and transport properties of these materials. Our results show that at 800 K, the largest figure of merit ($zT$) is 1.30 (0.86) for p-type (n-type) Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and 0.87 for n-type Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ at doping concentrations of $1.94 \times 10^{20}$ ($3.76 \times 10^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ and $3.52 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. Remarkably, a very low doping concentration is required to achieve a high $zT$, setting these materials apart from others in this field. Our calculations demonstrate that Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ benefits from the presence of conduction and valence band valleys near the band edges; however, the flat bands present in the valence band of Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ do not improve its thermoelectric performance. Among these systems, hole doping in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ has shown remarkable thermoelectric performance. Interestingly, the local octahedral distortions present in these perovskites contribute to a marked reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity to 0.27 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ and 0.20 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ by causing enhanced phonon scattering, further improving the thermoelectric figure of merit. This drop in thermal conductivity, combined with the favorable electronic properties, underscores the potential use of these materials for applications in highly efficient thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Interlayer-mediated catalyst engineering for ultra-high aspect ratio silicon nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable and precise etching of silicon nanostructures with ultra-high aspect ratios is required in many fields. Metal assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) in vapor is a plasma-free etching method that attracts considerable attention owing to the ability to create smooth, high aspect ratio nanostructures. MacEtch understanding and applications are limited by low fidelity and inconsistent pattern transfer from the catalyst layer to the silicon substrate. The locally constrained electrochemical interactions at the catalyst site make MacEtch particularly sensitive to catalyst contamination reducing the reaction rate and pinning the catalyst during etching. Removing contaminants is essential to improve pattern transfer for reliable processes on a larger area and higher aspect ratio. Physically separating the main source of carbon - the resist - from the catalyst with a sacrificial and functional interlayer solves this issue. The interlayer separates the resist and the catalyst and allows for thorough cleaning of the substrate before catalyst deposition. The resulting clean catalyst has improved stability, quality and reproducibility, enabling reliable fabrication of dense (50% patterned area) high aspect ratio (&gt;250:1) nanostructures. Two different interlayer materials (Cr and Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$) and two patterning approaches are presented, showcasing etching of various high aspect ratio nanostructures, such as X-ray Optics.</description>

Abstract: We present a simple methodology to compute the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) as a function of the canting angles in ferromagnets and altermagnets, starting from a nonmagnetic Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles calculations that preserves the full symmetry of the crystal structure. Magnetism is introduced by including on-site spin splitting, spin-orbit coupling, and spin-canting angles. As a representative material, we study SrRuO$_3$, which supports spin canting and exhibits a sign change of the AHC. In the ferromagnetic phase, the low-energy AHC is found to be close to zero at the Fermi level, in agreement with experimental observations. We show that the dependence of the AHC on the relevant physical parameters is most pronounced in the central region of the electronic bandwidth. We determine the symmetry-allowed components of the AHC for different magnetic orders in the large family of transition-metal perovskite ABO$_3$ compounds with space group $62$, including the spontaneous in-plane anomalous Hall effect. Within density functional theory, we evaluate the range of spin-canting angles in SrRuO$_3$ and demonstrate that it is suppressed as electronic correlations increase. By analyzing the AHC as a function of the canting angle, we find that the collinear magnetic configurations contribute most to the AHC, while spin canting plays a secondary role in determining its magnitude in non-collinear ferromagnets and altermagnets. However, canting can become relevant and induce a sign change of the AHC when the collinear magnetic state exhibits an AHC close to zero. Finally, we investigate the locations of Weyl points in the Brillouin zone and their evolution as a function of the canting angle.</description>

      <title>Two-Scale Analysis of the Electrostatics of Dielectric Crystals: Emergence of Polarization Density and Boundary Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic crystals, such as solid electrolytes and complex oxides, are central to modern technologies for energy storage, sensing, actuation, and other functional applications. An important fundamental issue in the atomic and quantum-scale modeling of these materials is defining the macroscopic polarization. In a periodic crystal, the usual definition of the polarization as the first moment of the charge density in a unit cell is found to depend qualitatively - allowing even a change in the sign - and quantitatively on the choice of unit cell.
  We examine this issue using a rigorous approach based on the framework of 2-scale convergence. By examining the continuum limit of when the lattice spacing is much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the body, we show that the 2-scale limit provides both a bulk polarization as well as a surface charge density supported on the boundary of the body. Further, different choices of the periodic unit cell of the body lead to correspondingly different partial unit cells at the boundary; these choices give to different bulk polarization and surface charges but compensate such that the electric field and energy are independent of the choice of unit cell.</description>

      <title>Annotated digital image correlation displacement fields from fatigue crack growth experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a curated dataset of planar displacement fields from eight fatigue crack growth experiments obtained via full-field digital image correlation (DIC). The dataset covers multiple aerospace-grade aluminium alloys, specimen geometries, material orientations, and load configurations, providing a diverse experimental basis for data-driven fracture mechanics research. Crack tip locations are consistently annotated using an iterative correction procedure applied to all measurements, and fracture mechanical descriptors like stress-intensity factors are provided as additional labels. The dataset comprises 8,794 unique experimentally observed displacement fields and a total of 70,352 supervised samples generated through standardized interpolation and augmentation. DIC data is provided as uniformly interpolated displacement grids at three standardized resolutions 28 x 28, 64 x 64, and 128 x 128 pixels, each available in three dataset sizes to support scalable use cases ranging from educational applications to high-capacity model development. Accompanying metadata and a Python interface facilitate filtering, loading, and integration into reproducible machine learning and fracture mechanics workflows.</description>

      <title>Low magnetic moment and unconventional magneto-transport in half-Heusler alloy CoVGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we experimentally realize CoVGe for the first time and investigate its structural, magnetic, and transport properties, supported by theoretical calculations. The material crystallizes in a cubic structure and exhibits a very low magnetic moment of 0.13 {\mu}B per formula unit at 5 K. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity suggests half-metallic behaviour. Magnetoresistance shows a positive, non-saturating linear field dependence at low temperature that gradually weakens with increasing temperature. The combination of low magnetic moment and unusual magnetotransport behaviour positions CoVGe as a promising platform for exploring spin-dependent transport in Heusler-based materials.</description>

      <title>Scalable Solar-Blind Imaging Enabled by Single-Crystalline Beta-Ga2O3 Membranes on Silicon Backplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors are attractive for solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) detection owing to their intrinsically low noise and high spectral selectivity, yet their deployment in large-area, high-density electronic imaging systems remains limited by a fundamental trade-off between material quality, device speed, and compatibility with high-density planar silicon readout circuits. Here, we report a membrane-enabled integration platform based on transferable single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 that overcomes these constraints at the system level. By exploiting the weak interplanar bonding of beta-Ga2O3 (100) plane, we obtain wafer-scale freestanding single-crystalline membranes that enable vertically integrated photodiodes with sub-microsecond, non-persistent photoresponse and high UV-visible rejection. Crucially, we introduce a stitching-based membrane assembly strategy that decouples array resolution from the size of the source single-crystalline substrate, allowing high-resolution photodetector arrays to be integrated onto silicon thin-film-transistor backplanes. The modular assembled active-matrix UV imaging arrays exhibit uniform solar-blind response without image lag, in stark contrast to arrays based on amorphous or polycrystalline films. Beyond beta-Ga2O3, this membrane-enabled and stitching-based modular integration strategy provides a general route toward high-speed, high-resolution electronic imaging systems using transferable single-crystalline semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Growth and Transport Properties of InAsSb Nanoflags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work reports, for the first time, the growth of high-quality free-standing InAsSb nanoflags and their electronic properties. Different growth conditions have been explored, and zinc-blende InAsSb nanoflags of various composition have been obtained. In particular, InAs0.77Sb0.23 nanoflags are on average (2000+-180) nm long, (640+-50) nm wide, and (130+-30) nm thick. We show that these nanoflags have a Land\'e g-factor larger than InAs and InSb and a mobility comparable to those of the best performing InAs and InSb nanoflags. Besides, we show evidence for a surface Fermi level pinning in the conductance band of these InAs0.77Sb0.23 nanoflags, similar to the well-known behavior of InAs. This promises to make InAsSb easy to couple to superconductors, while keeping or improving many of the features that make InSb an interesting material for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Long-range electrostatics in atomistic machine learning: a physical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusion of long-range electrostatics in atomistic machine learning (ML) is receiving increasing attention for achieving quantum-mechanical accuracy in predicting a wide range of molecular and material properties. However, there is still no general prescription on how long-range physical effects should be incorporated into the model while preserving well-established locality principles underlying most transferable ML representations. Here, we provide a physical perspective on the problem, by discussing how distinct contributions to the system's electrostatics can be captured through the adoption of different learning paradigms. Specifically, we discern between local charge models, which rely either on explicit charge-density decompositions or implicit auxiliary variables, and models where a notion of nonlocality is deliberately introduced, either via self-consistent procedures or by using nonlocal descriptors and learning architectures. We further address the related aspect of incorporating finite-field effects through the coupling with the system's polarization, relevant for the application of an external electric bias. We conclude by discussing the implications for the simulation of electrochemical interfaces, where long-range electrostatics are essential to capture the interplay between charge redistribution, interfacial dynamics, and ionic screening, and for ionic transport phenomena, which, although less explored, appear far less sensitive to their inclusion.</description>

      <title>Atomically-sharp magnetic soliton in the square-net lattice EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological spin textures are hallmark manifestations of competing interactions in magnetic matter. Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field. Our results demonstrate that EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ hosts atomically-sharp, field-driven 1D magnetic solitons, providing a new platform for studying 1D topological excitations at the atomic length scale.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Quantum Point Contact in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs), atomic reconstruction gives rise to moir\'e domains with alternating ferroelectric polarization, whose domain size and overall electric dipole moment are tunable by an out-of-plane electric field. Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moir\'e domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moir\'e domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moir\'e domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moir\'e domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs).</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical properties of the neutral silicon-vacancy center in diamond under extreme isotropic strain fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutral silicon--vacancy (SiV$^{0}$) center in diamond combines inversion symmetry with optical emission, making it a robust quantum emitter resilient to stray electric fields. Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy. These trends yield compact calibration relations linking optical and spin observables to isotropic strain and establish SiV$^{0}$ as a symmetry-protected, strain-tunable quantum emitter operating into the multi-megabar-equivalent regime.</description>

      <title>On generating Special Quasirandom Structures: Optimization for the DFT computational efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our novel evolutionary algorithm for generating Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) designed to optimize the computational efficiency of Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations. Operating on the premise that symmetry proxies non-randomness, we rigorously filter out 1.P1 candidate structures prior to evaluating correlation functions. Our extinction-based workflow includes the seeding, filtration, evaluation, extinction, and repopulation phases to produce efficient supercells with maximal local environmental distinctness. We compare our results against those generated by established software packages, on the example of the W\textsubscript{70}Cr\textsubscript{30} alloy. Although standard tools achieve (marginally) lower correlation errors, our best-performing structures require approximately five times fewer unique displacements for phonon calculations. This approach sacrifices negligible quantitative disorder accuracy to significantly reduce the computational cost of modeling thermal properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial polymeric materials often rely on antioxidants to achieve long-term reliability. Previous studies have frequently discussed the stabilization effect in the presence of macroscopic additive migration. However, the micro- to meso-scale coupling between polymer dynamics and antioxidant molecular dynamics remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we extend a polymer dynamics simulation framework that can account for oxidative aging. We also update the model so that it can explicitly incorporate antioxidant molecules into the simulation. As a result, the framework enables us to quantify how molecular architecture of antioxidants affects oxidation kinetics, which has previously been inferred only indirectly from apparent changes in reaction rates. It also allows us to evaluate the effects of antioxidant concentration and molecular architecture on the spatial heterogeneity of oxidative aging.</description>

      <title>From Natural Language to Materials Discovery:The Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerating the discovery of high-performance materials remains a central challenge across energy, electronics, and aerospace technologies, where traditional workflows depend heavily on expert intuition and computationally expensive simulations. Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D &gt; 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.</description>

      <title>Impact of interface defects on the band alignment and performance of TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is essential for enhancing their performance, improving their stability, and making them commercially viable for large-scale deployment in solar energy harvesting applications. Point defects, like vacancies, have a dual role, as they can inherently provide a proper doping, but they can also reduce the collected current by trap-assisted recombination. Moreover, they can play an active role in ion migration and degradation. Using {\it ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations we investigate the changes in the band alignment induced by interfacial vacancy defects in a TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O based PSC. Depending on the type of the vacancy (Ti, Cu, O, Pb, I) in the oxide and perovskite materials, additional doping is superimposed on the already existing background. Their effect on the performance of the PSCs becomes visible, as shown by SCAPS simulations. The most significant impact is observed for $p$ type doping of TiO$_2$ and $n$ type doping of Cu$_2$O, while the effective doping of the perovskite layer affects one of the two interfaces. We discuss these results based on modifications of the band structure near the active interfaces and provide further insights concerning the optimization of electron and hole collection.</description>

      <title>Coherent control through phonon anharmonicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anharmonic lattice vibrations play a key role in many physical phenomena. They govern the heat conductivity of solids, strongly affect the phonon spectra, play a prominent role in soft mode phase transitions, allow ultrafast engineering of material properties and more. The most direct evidence for anharmonicity is to measure the oscillation frequency changing as a function of the oscillation amplitude. For lattice vibrations, this is not a trivial task, and anharmonicity is probed indirectly through its effects on thermodynamic properties and spectral features or through coherent decay of one mode to another. However, measurement and control of the anharmonicity of a single Raman mode is still lacking. We show that ultrafast double pump-probe spectroscopy could be used to directly observe frequency shifts of Raman phonons as a function of the oscillation amplitude and disentangle the coherent contributions from quasi-harmonic sources such as temperature and changes to the carrier density in the thermoelectric materials SnTe and SnSe. Moreover, we show that coherent displacive phononic excitations in tandem with electron-phonon coupling is a pathway to dynamically control phonon anharmonicity. Our results have dramatic implications for the material engineering of future thermoelectrics. Moreover, our methodology could be used to isolate the basic mechanisms driving optically induced phase transitions and other nonlinear phenomena based on their unique timestamps.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric training of multiferroic domains in Mn$_2$GeO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics promise direct cross-control between coexisting ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders, which is of interest for applications in magnetism and spintronics. A particularly interesting type of cross-control is found in spin-spiral multiferroic Mn$_2$GeO$_4$, where a ferroelectric multi-domain distribution can be globally inverted by a single magnetic field sweep. In this work we consider the initial domain evolution from zero-field cooling, imaging the evolution of domains under both magnetic and electric fields via optical second harmonic generation. We find that polarization and magnetization domains form independently when entering the multiferroic phase, and a single deterministic initialisation procedure, spanning three quarters of a field cycle, is required to achieve reliable magnetoelectric cross-coupling. This initialisation behaviour originates from a deterministic pathway from metastable to equilibrium domain patterns, in contrast to more common and less reliable domain "training" procedures that require repeated field cycles. Understanding the initial domain evolution thus enables reliable cross-control in magnetoelectric devices with highly interlinked order parameters.</description>

      <title>Unconventional orbital currents and torques due to ferro-rotational orbital textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum transport has emerged as a promising route for manipulating magnetic devices, yet its generation has largely relied on the conventional orbital Hall effect. Here, we show that ferro-rotational order enables the electrical generation of unconventional orbital currents. These orbital currents represent the orbital counterparts of spin currents due to ferromagnetic order, but arise from rotation-induced symmetry breaking rather than time-reversal symmetry breaking or spin-orbit coupling. Using tight-binding models, we identify the underlying intrinsic, nonrelativistic mechanism categorized as an electric hexadecapole moment and corroborate our findings with first-principles calculations for the ferro-rotational material TiAu$_4$. We further show that these rotation-induced orbital currents lead to surface orbital accumulation and unconventional orbital torque in a ferro-rotational/ferromagnetic metallic bilayer, allowing deterministic field-free switching. Our findings unveil a novel pathway for generating orbital currents beyond the conventional orbital Hall effect, broadening the landscape of orbitronics research to include novel ferroic materials and higher-order electric multipoles.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.794 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.440 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of mirror-odd and mirror-even spin texture in ultra-thin epitaxially-strained RuO2 films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, rutile RuO$_2$ has attracted renewed interest due to expectations of prominent altermagnetic spin-splitting. However, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that in its bulk and thick-film forms, RuO$_2$ does not display any form of magnetic ordering. Despite this, the spin structure of RuO$_2$ remains largely unexplored in the ultra-thin limit, where substrate-imposed epitaxial strain can be substantial. Here, we employ spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by ab-initio calculations, to reveal the electronic structure of 2.7~nm-thick epitaxial RuO$_2$ heterostructures. We observe an unconventional spin texture characterized by the coexistence of mirror-even and mirror-odd momentum-dependent components. A comprehensive symmetry analysis rules out nonmagnetic origins of this spin texture. These findings suggest an emergent non-relativistic spin structure enabled by epitaxial strain in the ultra-thin limit, marking a distinct departure from the behavior of relaxed or bulk RuO$_2$. Our work opens new perspectives for exploring symmetry-breaking mechanisms and spin textures in oxide heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Quantum magnonics studies the quantum properties of magnons, the quanta of spin waves, and their application in quantum information processing. Progress in this field depends on identifying magnetic materials with characteristics tailored to the diverse requirements of magnonics and quantum magnonics. For single-magnon excitation, its control, hybrid coupling, and entanglement, the most critical property is the ability to support long magnon lifetimes. This perspective reviews established and emerging magnetic materials, including ferromagnetic metals, Heusler compounds, antiferromagnets, altermagnets, organic and 2D van der Waals magnets, hexaferrites, europium chalcogenides, and in particular yttrium iron garnet (YIG), highlighting their key characteristics. YIG remains the benchmark, with bulk crystals supporting sub-microsecond Kittel-mode lifetimes and ultra-pure spheres achieving $\sim18\,\mu$s for dipolar-exchange magnons at millikelvin temperatures. However, thin YIG films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates suffer from severe lifetime reduction due to substrate-induced losses. In contrast, YIG films on a new lattice matched, diamagnetic alternative, yttrium scandium gallium/aluminum garnet (YSGAG), overcomes these limitations and preserves low magnetic damping down to millikelvin temperatures. These advances provide a practical pathway toward ultralong-living magnons in thin films, enabling scalable quantum magnonics with coherent transport, strong magnon-photon, magnon-qubit coupling, and integrated quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Reaction-Diffusion Driven Patterns in Immiscible Alloy Thin Films</title>

Abstract: Controlling the microstructure of thin films is of critical importance for various applications. We demonstrate a methodology for tuning the local microstructure through film-substrate interactions using Ag-Cu as a model system. Metastable single-phase Ag-Cu thin films are deposited on Si substrates pre-patterned by FIB milling. During post-deposition annealing, localized film-substrate reaction around the milled patterns produces a distinct microstructure termed as the 'halo'. It consists of copper silicide and almost pure Ag, while the far-field film forms a random mixture of Cu and Ag-rich domains through phase separation. We show that the extent of the halo can be controlled by varying the temperature and duration of annealing. We present a semi-analytical kinetic model of product and halo growth that incorporates species balance, diffusional transport and a modified Stefan condition. Predictions from the model reveal two distinct growth regimes of the product with power law indices of 1/2 and 2/7 and experimental data fall into the latter regime. These regimes originate from the dimensionality of growth (2d or 3d) compared to that of solute transport (2d), which in turn depend on film thickness and species diffusivity. Using an inverse optimization procedure, we also estimate the diffusivity, which suggests grain boundary diffusion to be the dominant transport mechanism. This study provides an avenue and framework for microstructural engineering of alloy thin films through interfacial reaction.</description>

      <title>Crystal Representation in the Reciprocal Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In crystallography, a structure is typically represented by the arrangement of atoms in the direct space. Furthermore, space group symmetry and Wyckoff site notations are applied to characterize crystal structures with only a few variables. While this representation is effective for data records and human learning, it lacks one-to-one correspondence between the crystal structure and its representation. This is problematic for many applications, such as crystal structure determination, comparison, and more recently, generative model learning. To address this issue, we propose to represent crystals in a four-dimensional (4D) reciprocal space featured by their Cartesian coordinates and scattering factors, which can naturally handle translation invariance and space group symmetry with the help of structure factors. In order to achieve rotational invariance, the 4D coordinates are then transformed into a power spectrum representation under the orthogonal spherical harmonic and radial basis. Hence, this representation captures both periodicity and symmetry of the crystal structure while also providing a continuous representation of the atomic positions and cell parameters in the direct space. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to several crystal structure matching and reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Approach to Light-Induced Hall Transport in Disordered Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a linear-scaling real-space methodology to compute time-resolved electrical responses of materials driven far-from-equilibrium, with energy relaxation and disorder treated on equal footing. Applying this approach to AB-stacked (Bernal) bilayer graphene, driven by a circularly polarized optical pulse, we observe the generation of a finite Hall conductivity. This Hall signal oscillates during optical driving and remains sizable after the light is switched off before relaxing toward equilibrium. Remarkably, this dynamical Hall response is robust in the presence of realistic descriptions of disorder, suggesting that disorder and relaxation dynamics can be leveraged as design parameters rather than being limitations. More broadly, our new methodology enables the investigation of electrical responses in driven, complex disordered quantum materials and highlights how engineered energy transfer pathways can enable ultrafast optoelectronic functionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the performance of EUCLID, Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery, a recently proposed framework for automated discovery of constitutive laws, on experimental data. Mechanical tests are performed on natural rubber specimens spanning simple to complex geometries, from which we collect both global, force elongation, and local, full-field displacement, measurements. Using these data, we obtain constitutive laws via two routes, the conventional identification of unknown parameters in a priori selected material models, and EUCLID, which automates model selection and parameter identification within a unified model-discovery pipeline. We compare the two methodologies using global versus local data, analyze predictive accuracy, and examine generalization to unseen geometries. Moreover, we quantify the experimental noise, investigate the coverage of the material state space achieved by each approach and discuss the relative performance of different datasets and different a priori chosen models versus EUCLID.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of orbital torque: Dependence on ferromagnet species and nonmagnetic layer thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic metals (FMs) through orbital torque (OT) has emerged as a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic devices without relying on heavy metals. While Ti and Cu are among the most extensively studied light nonmagnetic metals (NMs) for OT devices, theoretical calculations of the resulting torque have remained limited. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using realistic tight-binding models derived from \textit{ab initio} electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers. These results provide microscopic insight and practical guidance for designing light-metal-based orbitronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When multiple degrees of freedom share similar energy scales in quantum materials, intertwined electronic orders, which exhibit broken symmetries, are often strongly coupled. Recent studies on kagome superconductors such as CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ report rotational and time-reversal symmetry breaking linked to a charge density wave. Here, we observe a momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tuneable magnetic field, we demonstrate that the response of the electronic structure is compatible with piezomagnetism along with strong orbital selectivity. Our results show that the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking is associated with the vanadium Van Hove singularities at the onset of the charge density wave order. We also demonstrate the presence of fluctuations beyond the charge ordering temperature. Our results reveal that magnetic fields can be used as tuning knobs for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Screening Modulation of Graphene's Electronic Structure and the Helical Wavefunction Dominated Topological Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines electrostatic screening effects in graphene using tight binding calculations based on the Binding energy and Bond Charge model and a modified version of it. The results indicate that the modified BBC potential decays in an exponential manner with distance, which suppresses electron electron interactions. The hopping integrals exhibit a pronounced decrease over distance and shift with parameter variation. A band gap opens once the parameter exceeds a certain threshold. The density of states shows a prominent peak near the Fermi level, whereas the low-energy region remains largely unchanged. The low energy helical wave functions in graphene display topological characteristics, including pseudospin momentum locking and a {\pi} Berry phase, resulting in distinctive transport properties. By avoiding the Coulomb singularity, the model offers valuable insights for the engineering of screening in two-dimensional systems and the design of topological devices.</description>

      <title>Single-Emitter Spectra from an Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneity in nanoscale emitters hinders efforts to understand their basic photophysics and limits their use in practical applications. Existing methods have difficulty accurately characterizing single-emitter spectra and optical heterogeneity on a statistical scale. Here, we introduce SPICEE (SPectrally Imbalanced Correlations from Ensemble Emission), a spectrally filtered photon-correlation technique that recovers single-particle emission lineshapes from an ensemble sample. Analytical derivations, numerical modeling, and experiments on a solution ensemble of emitters validate the technique. We apply SPICEE to blue-emitting ZnSeTe semiconductor nanocrystals relevant to display applications and find that the low color purity in the ensemble spectrum is primarily caused by a small subpopulation of nanocrystals with a distinct emission mechanism. This work demonstrates that SPICEE is a powerful high-throughput tool for accurately characterizing the single-emitter properties of nanoscale systems.</description>

      <title>diffpy.morph: Python tools for model independent comparisons between sets of 1D functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: diffpy.morph addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. diffpy.morph allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. diffpy.morph is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.</description>

      <title>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$ nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</description>
