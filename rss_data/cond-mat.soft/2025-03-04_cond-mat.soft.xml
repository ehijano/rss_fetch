      <title>The Dynamics in Vibro-fluidized Beds: A Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the densification of a granular model system of polystyrene spheres over time by shaking with varying excitation amplitudes or effective temperatures. This densification is quantified by the mean square displacement (MSD), which is measured by diffuse wave spectroscopy (DWS) of a sinusoidally excited vibrating fluidized granular bed. The DWS method also extracts the inherent heterogeneous dynamics of the system in the bulk and at the wall. Through an empirical model-based extraction we obtain the ballistic and diffusive time constants, as well as caging sizes, which were found to depend on temperature and density. The results obtained from this study reveal a sub-diffusive power-law behavior in the MSD, indicating an arrest of motion and potentially a glassy system, especially in cases where the excitation is low to moderate compared to gravity. The extracted MSD caging sizes are two orders smaller than the Lindeman length found in colloidal systems.</description>

      <title>Modelling the non-linear viscoelastic behaviour of brain tissue in torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tissue accommodates non-linear deformations and exhibits time-dependent mechanical behaviour. The latter is one of the most pronounced features of brain tissue, manifesting itself primarily through viscoelastic effects such as stress relaxation. To investigate its viscoelastic behaviour, we performed ramp-and-hold relaxation tests in torsion on freshly slaughtered cylindrical ovine brain samples ($25\,\,\text{mm}$ diameter and $\sim 10\,\,\text{mm}$ height). The tests were conducted using a commercial rheometer at varying twist rates of $\{40,240,400\}\,\,\text{rad}\,\,\text{m}^{-1}\,\,\text{s}^{-1}$, with the twist remaining fixed at $\sim 88\,\,\text{rad}\,\,\text{m}^{-1}$, which generated two independent datasets for torque and normal force. The complete set of viscoelastic material parameters was estimated via a simultaneous fit to the analytical expressions for the torque and normal force predicted by the modified quasi-linear viscoelastic model. The model's predictions were further validated through finite element simulations in FEniCS. Our results show that the modified quasi-linear viscoelastic model -- recently reappraised and largely unexploited -- accurately fits the experimental data. Moreover, the estimated material parameters are in line with those obtained in previous studies on brain samples under torsion. When coupled with bespoke finite element models, these material parameters could enhance our understanding of the forces and deformations involved in traumatic brain injury and contribute to the design of improved headgear for sports such as boxing and motorsports. On the other hand, our novel testing protocol offers new insights into the mechanical behaviour of soft tissues other than the brain.</description>

      <title>Flowing menisci: coupled dynamics and liquid exchange with soap films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid foams exhibit menisci whose lengths range from hundreds of microns in microfoams to several centimeters in macroscopic bubble arrangements. These menisci thin under gravity until reaching a steady thickness profile, where hydrostatic and capillary pressures are balanced. While these menisci are in contact with soap films, dynamical liquid exchanges between them are neglected in current drainage models, which assume thin films provide a negligible liquid reservoir. Using controlled experiments, we systematically measure the shape of an isolated meniscus placed in a vertical soap film. By increasing the film thickness, we identify a flowing regime in which the flux from the adjacent film significantly enlarges the meniscus. We present an analytical model that extends the drainage equation to incorporate this film flux and introduce a gravito-exchange length, which sets the minimum meniscus thickness. The model is in quantitative agreement with experiments, capturing the transition between hydrostatic and flowing menisci. This study has implications for flowing or rearranging foams, where thick films are commonly observed.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Field Theory for Semiflexible Gaussian Chain Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is one of the useful methods to simulate phase separated structures of multi-component polymer systems. In this article, we propose an SCFT for semiflexible polymer melts, where the basic equations for the SCFT are derived by introducing a bending stiffness into a flexible Gaussian bead-spring model and taking its continuous limit. Our SCFT is described by a coupled modified diffusion equations for the statistical weight of the chain conformation (path integral), which is a perturbation to semiflexible chains from the flexible Gaussian chain model. Using our modified diffusion equations, we investigated the influences of the bending stiffness on the conformations of symmetric semiflexible diblock copolymer in a strongly segregated lamellar structures and on the order-disorder transition.</description>

      <title>Contactless measurements of the elastic modulus of living cells using thermal fluctuations of AFM cantilever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a contactless method for measuring the elastic modulus of living cells (human triple-negative breast cancer, MDA-MB-231) from the thermal fluctuations of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. By analyzing the power spectral density (PSD) of the cantilevers thermal fluctuations, we obtain the resonance frequencies of its first three modes at various cell to cantilever separation distances. By comparing measurements on living cells with those on a rigid borosilicate sphere of the same size, we extract the frequency shift caused by the elasto-hydrodynamic coupling between the cantilever fluctuations and the deformations of the cells. We then fit this frequency shift using an elasto-hydrodynamic model that integrates hydrodynamic forces and cell deformation. This approach allows us to determine the elastic modulus values of the living cells for the first three resonant frequencies of the cantilever.</description>

      <title>An interpretable continuum framework for decision-making: nonreciprocal field theory of the shepherding control problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field theories for complex systems traditionally focus on collective behaviors emerging from simple, reciprocal pairwise interaction rules. However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviors driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding control problem as a paradigmatic example, where agents (herders) must coordinate to confine another group of agents (targets) within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of distributed control. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from random to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behavior, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to crowd management systems.</description>

      <title>Do chain topology and polydispersity affect the two-stage heteropolymer coil-globule transition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic behavior of collapse transition in a fully flexible coarse-grained model of energy polydisperse polymer (EPP), a statistical model of random heteropolymer, is investigated in an implicit solvent by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Each monomer has interaction energy, $\varepsilon_i$, randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and is characterised by polydispersity index, $\delta$ = standard deviation/mean, where the mean is fixed at $\langle \varepsilon \rangle$ = 2.5. Polymers of different chain topologies assume an expanded coil conformation at high temperature, and undergo a melting transition called a coil-globule transition when temperature is lowered. They collapse into molten globules. Further decrease in temperature results in a liquid-solid transition called a freezing transition, thus, creating crystallite structures at very low temperatures. The current study investigates the effect of chain topology and energy polydispersity in this regard from thermodynamic point of view.</description>

      <title>Temporal Correlations and Inelastic Dynamics in a Vibrated Binary Granular Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of binary mixtures of inelastic particles through event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on velocity autocorrelation functions (VACFs). The study examines two distinct particle types under varying inelasticity conditions, systematically analyzing coefficients of restitution (CoR) ranging from 0.80 to 0.95. Like-particle interactions (AA and BB) maintain equal CoR values, while unlike-particle interactions (AB) are assigned the average CoR. The simulation framework incorporates a vibrating base system to maintain energy input and system stability. Our analysis reveals significant differences in VACF decay rates between Type 1 and Type 2 particles, demonstrating non-equipartition of energy within the binary mixture. The degree of this disparity is strongly influenced by the coefficient of restitution, with lower CoR values leading to more pronounced differences between particle types. These findings provide insights into the complex dynamics of granular gases and the role of inelasticity in energy distribution within binary mixtures. Our study contributes to the understanding of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in granular systems and has potential implications for industrial processes involving particulate materials, such as fluidized beds and pneumatic conveying systems.</description>

      <title>The emergent dynamics of double-folded randomly branching ring polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistics of randomly branching double-folded ring polymers are relevant to the secondary structure of RNA, the large-scale branching of plectonemic DNA (and thus bacterial chromosomes), the conformations of single-ring polymers migrating through an array of obstacles, as well as to the conformational statistics of eukaryotic chromosomes and melts of crumpled, non-concatenated ring polymers. Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.</description>

      <title>Tracking Cluster Continuity and Dynamics in Time-Series Data: Application to Chromatin Polymer Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an enhanced method for analyzing cluster dynamics, with a particular focus on tracking clusters' continuity over time using time-series data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The proposed method was applied to spatio-temporal cluster data obtained from a non-equilibrium MD simulation of a chromatin polymer model. In this model, clusters are formed on the polymer by binding molecules that stochastically and temporarily bind to the polymer segments at finite rates. Our analysis successfully tracked the dynamics of clusters, including merging and splitting events, and revealed that clusters exhibit a percolation transition in both spatial and temporal domains. This suggests that clusters in the chromatin polymer model can persist even under finite rates of attractive interactions, demonstrating that the method can capture complex cluster dynamics over time.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen bond-driven interactions between chitosan and biobased surfactants: A study of bulk behavior and surface adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the hydrogen bond-mediated association between chitosan (CHI) and alkyl polyglucoside (APG), a bio-based surfactant, in acidic conditions with varying ionic strengths. Unlike conventional polyelectrolyte-surfactant interactions that depend on electrostatic forces, the association in this system relies purely on non-ionic interactions. Using UV visible spectroscopy, phase diagrams, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), the bulk phase behavior and adsorption characteristics of CHI-APG mixtures on negatively charged surfaces was studied. Results demonstrate that APG concentration controls the phase behavior, with moderate levels inducing coacervate formation, while higher ionic strengths promote this coacervation through enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions. This shift leads to the formation of a phase separated morphology, with micronsized coacervate droplets observable in solution. Zeta potential measurements suggest that these droplets adopt a core shell structure, characterized by a hydrophobic core due to the surfactant s alkyl chains and a hydrophilic shell formed by chitosan. Additionally, the coacervation process significantly enhances the adsorption of CHI APG complexes onto solid substrates, a feature with potential applications in targeted delivery and controlled release systems. Overall, this study provides critical insights into the design of bio-based, sustainable formulations and expands the understanding of hydrogen bond-driven, nonelectrostatic coacervation, relevant for applications in cosmetics, biomedical coatings, and environmentally friendly materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermo-responsive hydrogels are smart materials that rapidly switch between hydrophilic (swollen) and hydrophobic (shrunken) states when heated past a threshold temperature, resulting in order-of-magnitude changes in gel volume. Modelling the dynamics of this switch is notoriously difficult, and typically involves fitting a large number of microscopic material parameters to experimental data. In this paper, we present and validate an intuitive, macroscopic description of responsive gel dynamics and use it to explore the shrinking, swelling and pumping of responsive hydrogel displacement pumps for microfluidic devices. We finish with a discussion on how such tubular structures may be used to speed up the response times of larger hydrogel smart actuators and unlock new possibilities for dynamic shape change.</description>

      <title>Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized bistable and monostable phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the bistable and monostable phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>Long-range translational order and hyperuniformity in two-dimensional chiral active crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study two-dimensional athermal chiral active particles at high densities. The particles in this system perform the circular motion with frequency $\Omega$. We show that the system crystallizes at high densities even in two dimensions, accompanied by the true long-range translational order. This is due to the anomalous suppression of displacement fluctuations associated with hyperuniformity. These findings can be explained using an active elastic theory quantitatively. Surprisingly, the crystals become unstable and melt in the limit of $\Omega=0$, for the spatial dimension of four or less. This result can be explained by a mechanism akin to quenched random systems for which the lower critical dimension is four.</description>

      <title>Anomalous rheology of puller-type microswimmer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the mechanism underlying the anomalous rheology of puller-type microswimmer suspensions through direct hydrodynamic simulations. Puller-type swimmers generate contractile flow fields along their swimming direction, leading to hydrodynamic interactions that cause the swimmers to align vertically. Our simulations reveal that this alignment effect, along with the resultant orientational order of swimming motion, becomes particularly pronounced near boundary walls, where local swimmer density is amplified, predominantly controlling the overall swimming dynamics and rheological properties of the suspension. These findings contrast with our previous simulations of pusher-type swimmers, which hydrodynamically interact through extensile flow fields, whereby they exhibit weak orientational order in the bulk region, which primarily determines their steady-state properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the steady-state behavior near the walls is strongly influenced by the aspect ratio of the microswimmers and the degree of confinement between the walls. Our results highlight the crucial role of microswimmer characteristics, such as shape and swimming mechanisms, in determining the rheological properties of active suspensions.</description>

      <title>Glassforming liquid crystalline equimolar mixtures of MHPOBC and fluorinated compounds -- structural, optical, and dielectric properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three liquid crystalline equimolar mixtures are formulated, each containing the MHPOBC compound and the homolog from the 3FmHPhF6 series with m = 4, 5, and 6. The properties of the mixtures are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electro-optic measurements, and UV-Vis-NIR and dielectric spectroscopies. In all mixtures, the smectic A*, smectic C*, and smectic C$_A$* phases are observed. Each mixture can be supercooled and forms the glass of smectic C$_A$* at 225-238 K. The glass transition temperature decreases with the increasing C$_m$H$_{2m}$ chain length in the 3FmHPhF6 molecule. The tilt angle in the smectic C$_A$* phase reaches 36.5-37.5{\deg}. The selective reflection of light in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges is observed, with a strong dependence of the reflected light's wavenumber on temperature.</description>

      <title>Linear-limit aging times of three monoalcohols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents data for the physical aging of the three monoalcohols 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 5-methyl-2-hexanol, and 1-phenyl-1-propanol. Aging is studied by monitoring the dielectric loss at a fixed frequency in the kHz range following temperature jumps of a few Kelvin's magnitude, starting from states of equilibrium. The three alcohols differ in the Debye relaxation strength and how much the Debye process is separated from the $\alpha$ process. We first demonstrate that single-parameter aging describes all data well and proceed to utilize this fact to identify the linear-limit normalized aging relaxation functions. From the Laplace transform of these functions, the linear-limit aging loss-peak angular frequency defines the inverse of the linear aging relaxation time. This allows for a comparison to the temperature dependence of the Debye and $\alpha$ dielectric relaxation times of the three monoalcohols. We conclude that the aging response for 5-methyl-2-hexanol and 2-ethyl-1-butanol follows the $\alpha$ relaxation, not the Debye process, while no firm conclusion can be reached for 1-phenyl-1-propanol because its Debye and $\alpha$ processes are too close to be reliably distinguished.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Spreading and Memory Retention Under Power Law Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power law potentials dictate interactions across scales and matter, controlling the structure and dynamics of inanimate, and living systems. Though the equilibrium distributions of particles with a power law repulsion were extensively studied, their unconfined dynamical evolution gained far less attention -- Yet, living matter is inherently out of equilibrium and is seldom static. Here, we investigate the overdamped dynamic spreading of a dense suspension of particles under repulsive pair-potential of the form $1/r^k$. Coarse graining the pair interactions, we predict that the suspension spreads in a self-similar form, with its radius growing in time as $t^{1/(k+2)}$, independent of the spatial dimension ($d$). We confirm this prediction experimentally in quasi-two dimensions using perpendicularly magnetized colloids with dipolar repulsion ($k=3$). Numerical simulations corroborate the experiments for the $k=3$ case and further predict a categorically different behavior at a critical power law: when $k&lt;d-2$, the initial distribution is no longer concentrated at the origin. Instead, particles accumulate at the perimeter and retain a long-lived memory of their original pattern. We demonstrate that below this threshold, the initial distribution seeds the resulting pattern, encoding the future structure of an unconfined, and dynamically evolving system.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in the nematic liquid crystal under the direct current electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the electrical properties of the liquid crystal compound, known as an RM734, exhibiting a ferroelectric nematic phase. The influence of alternating (AC) and direct (DC) current electric fields on the switching process of the polarization vector and dielectric constant of planarly aligned ferronematic and nematic phases were examined. The decrease of the real part of electric permittivity in the ferronematic phase and the creation of ferroelectric order in the nematic phase under the DC field were demonstrated. The analysis of the results reveals the latching of the ferroelectric state. The applied DC field created a ferroelectric mode in the nematic phase. A new model of collective and molecular relaxations considering the domain structure of the ferronematic phase was proposed. The temperature and DC field dependence of dielectric properties were shown. The spontaneous polarization was measured using the field reversal technique. The spontaneous polarization value exhibits a maximum at the fixed temperature.</description>

      <title>How human-derived brain organoids are built differently from brain organoids derived from genetically-close relatives: A multi-scale hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How genes affect tissue scale organization remains a longstanding biological puzzle. As experimental efforts aim to quantify gene expression, chromatin organization, cellular structure, and tissue structure, computational modeling lags behind. To address this gap, we merge a cellular-based tissue model with a nuclear model that includes a deformable lamina shell and chromatin to test multiscale hypotheses linking chromatin and tissue scales. We propose a multiscale hypothesis focusing on brain organoids to explain structural differences between brain organoids built from induced-pluripotent human stem cells and induced-pluripotent gorilla and chimpanzee cells. Recent experiments discover that a cell fate transition from neuroepithelial to radial glial cells includes a new intermediate state delayed in human organoids, which narrows and lengthens cells on the apical side. Experiments show that the transcription factor ZEB2 plays a major role in the emergence of this intermediate state with ZEB2 mRNA levels peaking. We postulate that the enhancement of ZEB2 expression is potentially due to chromatin reorganization in response to mechanical deformations of the nucleus. A larger critical mechanical strain triggers reorganization in human-derived stem cells, causing delayed ZEB2 upregulation compared with genetically close relatives. We test this by exploring how slightly different initial configurations of chromatin reorganize under applied strain, with greater representing less genetically-close relatives. We find that larger configuration discrepancies produce increased differences in the magnitude of chromatin displacement that rise faster than linearly yet slower than exponentially. Changes in chromatin strain and contact maps can reveal species-specific differences, aiding our understanding of how one species differs in structure from another.</description>

      <title>Quantum time dynamics mediated by the Yang-Baxter equation and artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing shows great potential, but errors pose a significant challenge. This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error mitigation methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. We developed a novel method that combines ANN for noise mitigation combined with the YBE to generate noisy data. This approach effectively reduces noise in quantum simulations, enhancing the accuracy of the results. The YBE rigorously preserves quantum correlations and symmetries in spin chain simulations in certain classes of integrable lattice models, enabling effective compression of quantum circuits while retaining linear scalability with the number of qubits. This compression facilitates both full and partial implementations, allowing the generation of noisy quantum data on hardware alongside noiseless simulations using classical platforms. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating errors in time-evolving quantum states, providing a scalable framework to enhance quantum computation fidelity, particularly in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by performing quantum time dynamics simulations using the Heisenberg XY Hamiltonian on real quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Solute transport due to Periodic Loading in a Soft Porous Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In soft porous media, deformation drives solute transport via the intrinsic coupling between flow of the fluid and rearrangement of the pore structure. Solute transport driven by periodic loading, in particular, can be of great relevance in applications including the geomechanics of contaminants in the subsurface and the biomechanics of nutrient transport in living tissues and scaffolds for tissue engineering. However, the basic features of this process have not previously been systematically investigated. Here, we fill this hole in the context of a 1D model problem. We do so by expanding the results from a companion study, in which we explored the poromechanics of periodic deformations, by introducing and analysing the impact of the resulting fluid and solid motion on solute transport. We first characterise the independent roles of the three main mechanisms of solute transport in porous media -- advection, molecular diffusion, and hydrodynamic dispersion -- by examining their impacts on the solute concentration profile during one loading cycle. We next explore the impact of the transport parameters, showing how these alter the relative importance of diffusion and dispersion. We then explore the loading parameters by considering a range of loading periods -- from slow to fast, relative to the poroelastic timescale -- and amplitudes -- from infinitesimal to large. We show that solute spreading over several loading cycle increases monotonically with amplitude, but is maximised for intermediate periods because of the increasing poromechanical localisation of the flow and deformation near the permeable boundary as the period decreases.</description>
