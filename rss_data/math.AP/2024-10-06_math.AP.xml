      <title>Homogenization of elasto-plastic evolutions driven by the flow of dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a prototypical model of elasto-plasticity in the small-strain and quasi-static setting, where the evolution of the plastic distortion is driven exclusively by the motion of discrete dislocations, this work performs a rigorous homogenization procedure to a model involving continuously-distributed dislocation fields. Our main result shows the existence of rate-independent evolutions driven by the motion of dislocation fields, obtained as limits of discrete dislocation evolutions. For all notions of solutions we employ the recent concepts of space-time integral and normal currents, which is richer than the classical approach using the Kr\"oner dislocation density tensor. The key technical challenge is to find discrete dislocation evolutions approximating a given dislocation field evolution, which requires a careful recovery construction of space-time slip trajectories and associated displacements. These methods enable one to transfer the properties, most importantly the quasi-static stability, from the discrete to the field regime.</description>

      <title>Random vortex and expansion-rate model for Oberbeck-Boussinesq fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using a formulation of a class of compressible viscous flows with a heat source via vorticity and expansion-rate, we study the Oberbeck-Boussinesq flows. To this end we establish a new integral representation for solutions of parabolic equations subject to certain boundary condition, which allows us to develop a random vortex method for certain compressible flows and to compute numerically solutions of their dynamical models. Numerical experiments are carried out, which not only capture detailed B\'enard convection but also are capable of providing additional information on the fluid density and the dynamics of expansion-rate of the flow.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic fractional Sobolev spaces with variable exponent and application to nonlocal problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to introduce a new fractional anisotropic Sobolev space with variable exponent where the basic qualitative properties (completeness, separability, reflexivity, ...) are established, including the continuous and compact embedding results. Moreover, some functional proprieties of anisotropic fractional $\vec{p}(.,.)$-Laplacian operator are proved. As an application, we use the mountain pass theorem and Ekeland's variational principle to ensure the existence of a weak solution for a nonlocal anisotropic problem with variable exponent.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e-Sobolev equations with the critical exponent and a potential in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the hyperbolic space, we study a semilinear equation with non-autonomous nonlinearity having a critical Sobolev exponent. The Poincar\'e-Sobolev equation on the hyperbolic space explored by Mancini and Sandeep [Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa Cl. Sci. 7 (2008)] resembles our equation. As seen from the profile decomposition of the energy functional associated with the problem, the concentration happens along two distinct profiles: localised Aubin-Talenti bubbles and hyperbolic bubbles. Standard variational arguments cannot obtain solutions because of nontrivial potential and concentration phenomena. As a result, a deformation-type argument based on the critical points at infinity of the associated variational problem has been carried out to obtain solution for $N&gt;6.$ Conformal change of metric is used for proofs, enabling us to convert the original equation into a singular equation in a ball in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and perform a fine blow-up analysis.</description>

      <title>Fractional Schr\"odinger equations with mixed nonlinearities: asymptotic profiles, uniqueness and nondegeneracy of ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fractional Schr\"odinger equations with a vanishing parameter: $$
  (-\Delta)^s u+u =|u|^{p-2}u+\lambda|u|^{q-2}u \text{ in }\mathbb{R}^N,\quad u \in H^s(\mathbb{R}^N),$$ where $s\in(0,1)$, $N&gt;2s$, $2&lt;q&lt;p\leq 2^*_s=\frac{2N}{N-2s}$ are fixed parameters and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a vanishing parameter. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of positive ground state solutions for $\lambda$ small, when $p$ is subcritical, or critical Sobolev exponent $2_s^*$. For $p&lt;2_s^*$, the ground state solution asymptotically coincides with unique positive ground state solution of $(-\Delta)^s u+u=u^p$, whereas for $p=2_s^*$ the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions, after a rescaling, is given by the unique positive solution of the nonlocal critical Emden-Fowler type equation. Additionally, for $\lambda&gt;0$ small, we show the uniqueness and nondegeneracy of the positive ground state solution using these asymptotic profiles of solutions.</description>

      <title>Refining H\"older regularity theory in degenerate drift-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the H\"older continuity of bounded nonnegative weak solutions to \begin{align*} \big(\Phi^{-1}(w)\big)_t=\Delta w+\nabla\cdot\big(a(x,t)\Phi^{-1}(w)\big)+b\big(x,t,\Phi^{-1}(w)\big), \end{align*} with convex $\Phi\in C^0([0,\infty))\cap C^2((0,\infty))$ satisfying $\Phi(0)=0$, $\Phi'&gt;0$ on $(0,\infty)$ and $$s\Phi''(s)\leq C\Phi'(s)\quad\text{for all }s\in[0,s_0]$$ for some $C&gt;0$ and $s_0\in(0,1]$. The functions $a$ and $b$ are only assumed to satisfy integrability conditions of the form \begin{align*} a&amp;\in L^{2q_1}\big((0,T);L^{2q_2}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^N)\big),\\ b&amp;\in M\big(\Omega_T\times\mathbb{R}\big)\ \text{such that }\big|b(x,t,\xi)\big|\leq \hat{b}(x,t)\ \text{a.e. for some }\hat{b}\in L^{q_1}\big((0,T);L^{q_2}(\Omega)\big) \end{align*} with $q_1,q_2&gt;1$ such that $$\frac{2}{q_1}+\frac{N}{q_2}=2-N\kappa\quad\text{for some }\kappa\in(0,\tfrac{2}{N}).$$ Letting $w=\Phi(u)$ and assuming the inverse $\Phi^{-1}:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ to be locally H\"older continuous, this entails H\"older regularity for bounded weak solutions of $$u_t=\Delta\Phi(u)+\nabla\cdot\big(a(x,t)u\big)+b(x,t,u)$$ and, accordingly, covers a wide array of taxis type structures. In particular, many chemotaxis frameworks with nonlinear diffusion, which cannot be covered by the standard literature, fall into this category.
  After rigorously treating local H\"older regularity, we also extend the regularity result to the associated initial-boundary value problem for boundary conditions of flux-type.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of parabolic solutions for advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel example of a divergence-free velocity field $b \in L^\infty ((0,1); L^p (\mathbb{T}^2))$ for $p&lt;2$ arbitrary but fixed which leads to non-unique solutions of advection-diffusion in the class $L^\infty_{t,x} \cap L^2_t H^1_x$ while satisfying the local energy inequality. This result complements the known uniqueness result of bounded solutions for divergence-free and $L^2_{t,x}$ integrable velocity fields. Additionally, we also prove the necessity of time integrability of the velocity field for the uniqueness result. More precisely, we construct another divergence-free velocity field $b \in L^p ((0,1); L^\infty (\mathbb{T}^2))$, for $p&lt; 2$ fixed, but arbitrary, with non-unique aforementioned solutions. Our contribution closes the gap between the regime of uniqueness and non-uniqueness in this context. Previously, it was shown with the convex integration technique that for $d\geq 3$ divergence-free velocity fields $ b \in L^\infty((0,1);L^p (\mathbb{T}^d))$ with $p &lt; \frac{2d}{d+2}$ could lead to non-unique solutions in the space $L^\infty_t L^{\frac{2d}{d-2}}_x \cap L^2_t H^1_x$. Our proof is based on a stochastic Lagrangian approach and does not rely on convex integration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the partial $\mathrm{C}^{1,\alpha}$ regularity theory for minimizers of non-parametric integrals with emphasis on sharp dependence of the H\"older exponent $\alpha$ on structural assumptions for general zero-order terms. A particular case of our conclusions carries over to the parametric setting of Massari's regularity theorem for prescribed-mean-curvature hypersurfaces and there confirms optimal regularity up to the limit exponent.</description>

      <title>Discretizing the Fokker-Planck equation with second-order accuracy: a dissipation driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fully discrete finite volume scheme for the standard Fokker-Planck equation. The space discretization relies on the well-known square-root approximation, which falls into the framework of two-point flux approximations. Our time discretization is novel and relies on a tailored nonlinear mid-point rule, designed to accurately capture the dissipative structure of the model. We establish well-posedness for the scheme, positivity of the solutions, as well as a fully discrete energy-dissipation inequality mimicking the continuous one. We then prove the rigorous convergence of the scheme under mildly restrictive conditions on the unstructured grids, which can be easily satisfied in practice. Numerical simulations show that our scheme is second order accurate both in time and space, and that one can solve the discrete nonlinear systems arising at each time step using Newton's method with low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Inverse resonance problem on a perturbed infinite hyperbolic cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an inverse resonance problem on a radially and compactly perturbed infinite hyperbolic cylinder. Using the symmetries of this kind of geometry, we are led to study a stationary Schr{\"o}dinger equation on the line with a potential V which is the sum of a P{\"o}schl-Teller potential and a perturbation which we consider integrable and compactly supported. We define the resonances as the poles of the reflection coefficients with a negative imaginary part. We prove that, under some assumptions on the support of the compact perturbation, we are able to solve the question of uniqueness in the inverse resonance problem. We also give asymptotics of the resonances and show that they are asymptotically localised on two logarithmic branches and according to the localisation of the support of q, sometimes also on parallel lines to the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>H\"{o}lder regularity and Liouville Theorem for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with certain critical potentials, and applications to Dirichlet problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,d,\mu)$ be a metric measure space satisfying a doubling property with the upper/lower dimension $Q\ge n&gt;1$, and admitting an $L^2$-Poincar\'e inequality. In this article, we establish the H\"{o}lder continuity and a Liouville-type theorem for the (elliptic-type) Schr\"odinger equation $$\mathbb L u(x,t)=-\partial^2_{t}u(x,t)+\mathcal L u(x,t)+V(x)u(x,t)=0,\quad x\in X,\, t\in\mathbb R, $$ where $\mathcal L$ is a non-negative operator generated by a Dirichlet form on $X$, and the non-negative potential $V$ is a Muckenhoupt weight belonging to the reverse H\"older class ${RH}_q(X)$ for some $q&gt;\max\{Q/2,1\}$. Note that $Q/2$ is critical for the regularity theory of $-\Delta+V$ on $\mathbb{R}^Q$ ($Q\ge3$) by Shen's work in 1995, which hints the critical index of $V$ for the regularity results above on $X\times \mathbb R$ may be $(Q+1)/2$. Our results show that this critical index is in fact $\max\{Q/2,1\}$. Our approach primarily relies on the controllable growth of $V$ and the elliptic theory for the operator $\mathbb L$/$-\partial^2_{t}+\mathcal{L}$ on $X\times \mathbb R$, rather than the analogs for $\mathcal L+V$/$\mathcal{L}$ on $X$, under the critical index setting. As applications, we further obtain some characterizations for solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation $-\partial^2_{t}u+\mathcal L u+Vu=0$ in $X\times \mathbb R_+$ with boundary values in BMO/CMO/Morrey spaces related to $V$, improving previous results to the critical index $q&gt;\max\{Q/2,1\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the expected transition frequency between the two metastable states of a stochastic wave equation with double-well potential. By transition state theory, the frequency factorizes into two components: one depends only on the invariant measure, given by the $\phi^4_d$ quantum field theory, and the other takes the dynamics into account. We compute the first component with the variational approach to stochastic quantization when $d = 2, 3$. For the two-dimensional equation with random data but no stochastic forcing, we also compute the transmission coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional free boundary problem governed by a nonlinear diffusion - convection equation with a Neumann condition at fixed face $x=0$, which is variable in time and a like Stefan convective condition on the free boundary. Through successive transformations, an integral representation of the problem is obtained that involves a system of coupled nonlinear integral equations. Existence of the solution is obtained for all times by using fixed point theorems.</description>

Abstract: We address the global-in-time existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions for the stochastic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a multiplicative noise on the three-dimensional torus. Under natural smallness conditions on the noise, we prove the almost global existence result for small $L^{3}$ data. Namely, we show that for data sufficiently small, there exists a global-in-time strong $L^{3}$ solution in a space of probability arbitrarily close to~$1$.</description>

Abstract: We deal with the task of sampling from an unnormalized Boltzmann density $\rho_D$ by learning a Boltzmann curve given by energies $f_t$ starting in a simple density $\rho_Z$. First, we examine conditions under which Fisher-Rao flows are absolutely continuous in the Wasserstein geometry. Second, we address specific interpolations $f_t$ and the learning of the related density/velocity pairs $(\rho_t,v_t)$. It was numerically observed that the linear interpolation, which requires only a parametrization of the velocity field $v_t$, suffers from a "teleportation-of-mass" issue. Using tools from the Wasserstein geometry, we give an analytical example, where we can precisely measure the explosion of the velocity field. Inspired by M\'at\'e and Fleuret, who parametrize both $f_t$ and $v_t$, we propose an interpolation which parametrizes only $f_t$ and fixes an appropriate $v_t$. This corresponds to the Wasserstein gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence related to Langevin dynamics. We demonstrate by numerical examples that our model provides a well-behaved flow field which successfully solves the above sampling task.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black holes in the full subextremal range $|a|&lt;M$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove global existence, boundedness and decay for small data solutions $\psi$ to a general class of quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black hole backgrounds in the full sub-extremal range $|a|&lt;M$. The method extends our previous [DHRT22], which considered such equations on a wide class of background spacetimes, including Kerr, but restricted in that case to the very slowly rotating regime $|a|\ll M$ (which may be treated simply as a perturbation of Schwarzschild $a=0$). To handle the general $|a|&lt;M$ case, our present proof is based on two ingredients: (i) the linear inhomogeneous estimates on Kerr backgrounds proven in [DRSR16], further refined however in order to gain a derivative in elliptic frequency regimes, and (ii) the existence of appropriate physical space currents satisfying degenerate coercivity properties, but which now must be tailored to a finite number of wave packets defined by suitable frequency projection. The above ingredients can be thought of as adaptations of the two basic ingredients of [DHRT22], exploiting however the peculiarities of the Kerr geometry. The novel frequency decomposition in (ii), inspired by the boundedness arguments of [DR11, DRSR16], is defined using only azimuthal and stationary frequencies, and serves both to separate the superradiant and non-superradiant parts of the solution and to localise trapping to small regions of spacetime. The strengthened (i), on the other hand, allows us to relax the required coercivity properties of our wave-packet dependent currents, so as in particular to accept top order errors provided that they are localised to the elliptic frequency regime. These error terms are analysed with the help of the full Carter separation.</description>

      <title>Existence and structure of solutions for general $P$-area minimizing surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study existence and structure of solutions to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary problems associated with minimizers of the functional $I(u)=\int_{\Omega} (\phi(x, D u + F)+Hu) \, dx$, where $\phi (x, \xi)$, among other properties, is convex and homogeneous of degree $1$ with respect to $\xi$. We show that there exists an underlying vector field $N$ that characterizes the existence and structure of all minimizers. We also investigate existence of solutions under the barrier condition on $\partial \Omega$. The results in this paper generalize and unify many results in the literature about existence of minimizers of least gradient problems and $P-$area minimizing surfaces.</description>

      <title>The Onsager conjecture in 2D: a Newton-Nash iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $\gamma&lt;1/3$, we construct a nontrivial weak solution $u$ to the two-dimensional, incompressible Euler equations, which has compact support in time and satisfies $u\in C^\gamma(\mathbb R_t \times \mathbb T^2_x)$. In particular, the constructed solution does not conserve energy and, thus, settles the flexible part of the Onsager conjecture in two dimensions. The proof involves combining the Nash iteration technique with a new linear Newton iteration.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Poincar\'e inequalities on the half-space with singular weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Rellich-Kondrachov type theorems and weighted Poincar\'e inequalities on the half-space $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+=\{z=(x,y): x \in \mathbb{R}^N, y&gt;0\}$ endowed with the weighted Gaussian measure $\mu :=y^ce^{-a|z|^2}dz$ where $c+1&gt;0$ and $a&gt;0$. We prove that for some positive constant $C&gt;0$ one has \begin{align*}
  \left\|u-\overline u\right\|_{L^2_\mu(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)}\leq C \|\nabla u\|_{L^2_\mu (\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)},\qquad \forall u\in H^1_\mu(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+) \end{align*} where $\overline u=\frac 1{\mu(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+} u\,d\mu(z)$. Besides this we also consider the local case of bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+$ where the measure $\mu$ is $y^cdz$.</description>

      <title>Regularity of solutions for degenerate/singular fully nonlinear integro-differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a series of regularity results for solutions of a degenerate/singular fully nonlinear integro-differential equation
  $$- \bigg( \sigma_{1}(|Du|) + a(x) \sigma_{2}(|Du|) \bigg) I_{\tau}(u,x) = f(x).$$ In the degenerate case, we establish borderline regularity provided the inverse of degeneracy law $ \sigma_{2}$ is Dini-continuous. In addition, we show Schauder-type higher regularity at local extrema point for a concrete non-local degenerate equation. In the singular case, we prove gradient H\"{o}lder regularity of solutions to general non-local equation. It is noteworthy that these results are new even for the case $ a(x) \equiv 0 $. Finally, as a byproduct of the borderline regularity, we show how to apply our strategies in the study of the corresponding regularity for a class of degenerate non-local normalized $ p$-Laplacian equation.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetimes with applications to Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove global existence and decay for small-data solutions to a class of quasilinear wave equations on a wide variety of asymptotically flat spacetime backgrounds, allowing in particular for the presence of horizons, ergoregions and trapped null geodesics, and including as a special case the Schwarzschild and very slowly rotating $\vert a \vert \ll M$ Kerr family of black holes in general relativity. There are two distinguishing aspects of our approach. The first aspect is its dyadically localised nature: The nontrivial part of the analysis is reduced entirely to time-translation invariant $r^p$-weighted estimates, in the spirit of [DR09], to be applied on dyadic time-slabs which for large $r$ are outgoing. Global existence and decay then both immediately follow by elementary iteration on consecutive such time-slabs, without further global bootstrap. The second, and more fundamental, aspect is our direct use of a "blackbox" linear inhomogeneous energy estimate on exactly stationary metrics, together with a novel but elementary physical space top order identity that need not capture the structure of trapping and is robust to perturbation. In the specific example of Kerr black holes, the required linear inhomogeneous estimate can then be quoted directly from the literature [DRSR16], while the additional top order physical space identity can be shown easily in many cases (we include in the Appendix a proof for the Kerr case $\vert a \vert \ll M$, which can in fact be understood in this context simply as a perturbation of Schwarzschild). In particular, the approach circumvents the need either for producing a purely physical space identity capturing trapping or for a careful analysis of the commutation properties of frequency projections with the wave operator of time-dependent metrics.</description>

Abstract: Our work proves rigidity theorems for initial data sets associated with compact smooth spin manifolds with boundary and with compact convex polytopes, subject to the dominant energy condition. For manifolds with smooth boundary, this is based on the solution of a boundary value problem for Dirac operators. For convex polytopes we use approximations by manifolds with smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to apriori estimates for optimal transport maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key inequality which underpins the regularity theory of optimal transport for costs satisfying the Ma--Trudinger--Wang condition is the Pogorelov second derivative bound. This translates to an apriori interior $C^1$ estimate for smooth optimal maps. Here we give a new derivation of this estimate which relies in part on Kim, McCann and Warren's observation that the graph of an optimal map becomes a volume maximizing spacelike submanifold when the product of the source and target domains is endowed with a suitable pseudo-Riemannian geometry that combines both the marginal densities and the cost.</description>

      <title>A fast fractional block-centered finite difference method for two-sided space-fractional diffusion equations on general nonuniform grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a two-sided variable-coefficient space-fractional diffusion equation with fractional Neumann boundary condition is considered. To conquer the weak singularity caused by nonlocal space-fractional differential operators, a fractional block-centered finite difference (BCFD) method on general nonuniform grids is proposed. However, this discretization still results in an unstructured dense coefficient matrix with huge memory requirement and computational complexity. To address this issue, a fast version fractional BCFD algorithm by employing the well-known sum-of-exponentials (SOE) approximation technique is also proposed. Based upon the Krylov subspace iterative methods, fast matrix-vector multiplications of the resulting coefficient matrices with any vector are developed, in which they can be implemented in only $\mathcal{O}(MN_{exp})$ operations per iteration without losing any accuracy compared to the direct solvers, where $N_{exp}\ll M$ is the number of exponentials in the SOE approximation. Moreover, the coefficient matrices do not necessarily need to be generated explicitly, while they can be stored in $\mathcal{O}(MN_{exp})$ memory by only storing some coefficient vectors. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on Malliavin calculus in regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Malliavin calculus provides a characterization of the centered model in regularity structures that is stable under removing the small-scale cut-off. In conjunction with a spectral gap inequality, it yields the stochastic estimates of the model.
  This becomes transparent on the level of a notion of model that parameterizes the solution manifold, and thus is indexed by multi-indices rather than trees, and which allows for a more geometric than combinatorial perspective. In these lecture notes, this is carried out for a PDE with heat operator, a cubic nonlinearity, and driven by additive noise, reminiscent of the stochastic quantization of the Euclidean $\phi^4$ model.
  More precisely, we informally motivate our notion of the model $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ as charts and transition maps, respectively, of the nonlinear solution manifold. These geometric objects are algebrized in terms of formal power series, and their algebra automorphisms. We will assimilate the directional Malliavin derivative to a tangent vector of the solution manifold. This means that it can be treated as a modelled distribution, thereby connecting stochastic model estimates to pathwise solution theory, with its analytic tools of reconstruction and integration. We unroll an inductive calculus that in an automated way applies to the full subcritical regime.</description>
