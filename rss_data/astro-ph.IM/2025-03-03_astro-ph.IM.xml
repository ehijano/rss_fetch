      <title>Multibeam SETI Observations toward Nearby M dwarfs with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) targeted searches aim to observe specific areas and objects to find possible technosignatures. Many SETI researches have focused on nearby stars and their planets in recent years. In this paper, we report a targeted SETI observations using the most sensitive L-band Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward three nearby M dwarfs, all of which have been discovered exoplanet candidates. The minimum equivalent isotropic radiant power of the lower limit from the three sources we can detect is $6.19 \times 10^{8}$ W, which is well within the reach of current human technology. Applying the multibeam coincidence matching (MBCM) blind search mode, we search for narrowband drifting signals across 1.05-1.45 GHz in each of the two orthogonal linear polarization directions. An unusual signal at 1312.50 MHz detected from the observation toward AD Leo originally piqued our interest. However, we finally eliminate the possibility of an extraterrestrial origin based on much evidence, such as the polarization, frequency, and beam coverage characteristics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pre-Trained Visual Transformers for Multi-Band Photometric Light Curve Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a pre-trained visual transformer (VT) model, specifically the Swin Transformer V2 (SwinV2), to classify photometric light curves without the need for feature extraction or multi-band preprocessing. The goal is to assess whether this image-based approach can accurately differentiate astronomical phenomena and serve as a viable option for working with multi-band photometric light curves. We transformed each multi-band light curve into an image. These images serve as input to the SwinV2 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet-21K. The datasets employed include the public Catalog of Variable Stars from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) survey, using both one and two bands, and the first round of the recent Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), which includes six bands. The performance of the model was evaluated on six classes for the MACHO dataset and 20 distinct classes of variable stars and transient events for the ELAsTiCC dataset. The fine-tuned SwinV2 achieved better performance than models specifically designed for light curves, such as Astromer and the Astronomical Transformer for Time Series and Tabular Data (ATAT). When trained on the full MACHO dataset, it attained a macro F1-score of 80.2 and outperformed Astromer in single-band experiments. Incorporating a second band further improved performance, increasing the F1-score to 84.1. In the ELAsTiCC dataset, SwinV2 achieved a macro F1-score of 65.5, slightly surpassing ATAT by 1.3.</description>

      <title>COCOA: a compact Compton camera for astrophysical observation of MeV-scale gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: COCOA (COmpact COmpton cAmera) is a next-generation, cost-effective gamma-ray telescope designed for astrophysical observations in the MeV energy range. The detector comprises a scatterer volume employing the LiquidO detection technology and an array of scintillating crystals acting as absorber. Surrounding plastic scintillator panels serve as a veto system for charged particles. The detector's compact, scalable design enables flexible deployment on microsatellites or high-altitude balloons. Gamma rays at MeV energies have not been well explored historically (the so-called "MeV gap") and COCOA has the potential to improve the sensitivity in this energy band by up to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Space science &amp; the space economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Will it be possible in the future to realize large, complex space missions dedicated to basic science like HST, Chandra and JWST? Or will their cost be just too great? Today's space scene is completely different from that of even five years ago, and certainly from that of the time when HST, Chandra and JWST were conceived and built. Space-related investments have grown exponentially in recent years, with monetary investment exceeding half a trillion dollars in 2023. This boom is largely due to the rise of the so-called 'new space' economy driven by private commercial funding, which for the first time last year surpassed public investments in space. The introduction of a market logic to space activities results in more competition, and a resulting dramatic cost and schedule reduction. Can space science take advantage of the benefits of the new space economy to reduce cost and development time and at the same time succeed in producing powerful missions in basic science? The prospects for Europe and the USA are considered here. We argue that this goal would be attainable if the scientific community could take advantage of the three pillars underlying the innovation of the new space economy: (1) technology innovation proceeding through both incremental innovation and disruptive innovation, (2) business innovation, through vertical integration, scale production, and service oriented business model, and (3) cultural innovation, through openness to risk and iterative development.</description>

      <title>The Last Meridian Circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim is to document in some detail the last 35 years of meridian circles, a type of instrument with a fundamental role in astronomy for a very long time, and to do so while witnesses are still alive and can contribute. This is about finding facts. Meridian circles provided fundamental star positions for centuries. These positions were tied to a well-defined celestial coordinate system of right ascension and declination, and accurate proper motions ensured a transformation of the positions over long periods of time. This function of the meridian circles has been taken over by space astrometry and VLBI. The Hipparcos astrometric satellite was approved by ESA in 1980 and launched to a successful 3-year mission in 1989, and the successor, Gaia, has in 2025 completed a mission of over 10 years. An account is given of the last 18 meridian instruments, which were active for some part of the 35 years until 2015. This account is based on information found on the internet, and on input kindly supplied in correspondence with many colleagues.</description>

      <title>Spectrum management and the EVN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the utilisation of the radio spectrum has dramatically increased. Digital telecommunication applications, be it terrestrial cell-phone networks or new-space low-earth orbit satellite constellations, have not only acquired unprecedented amounts of spectrum but also use their frequencies everywhere on Earth. The consequences for radio astronomy and other scientific radio services are severe. A single cell-phone tower within hundreds of kilometers around a radio telescope can blind us and there is no place on Earth to escape the ubiquitous transmissions of satellite megaconstellations.
  Since 1988, the Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF) is advocating for astronomers' rights to use the spectrum. CRAF does this by participation in the national and international regulatory frameworks. Hundreds if not thousands of documents need to be processed every year. CRAF not only contributes to regulatory texts, but even more importantly, performs spectrum compatibility calculations. In this contribution, CRAF's latest activities are summarized with a focus on matters relevant to EVN operations.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Self-Triggering for Extensive Air Showers: Performance and FPGA Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray detection with radio antennas has traditionally depended on external triggers from particle detectors, constraining sensitivity and increasing complexity. Previous attempts at fully standalone, radio-only triggers have often failed under intense radio frequency interference, making genuine air-shower signals difficult to isolate. We present a proof-of-principle artificial intelligence-based self-triggering system that overcomes these limitations. By training a deep learning model on both real noise data and injected cosmic-ray-like pulses, we achieve an exceptionally low false-positive rate alongside high detection efficiency. Configurable operating points can suppress false positives below 0.01\% while retaining more than 88\% of genuine signals, and can even eliminate false positives entirely at a modest reduction in signal efficiency. This flexibility makes single-station cosmic-ray detection feasible without requiring external trigger inputs. Applying our approach to real-world noise conditions reduces the initial false-positive event rate by several orders of magnitude, supporting large-scale deployments. Extrapolation to dedicated hardware implementations, such as FPGAs, indicates that sub-\SI{}{\micro\second} inference times are achievable, enabling real-time autonomous triggering. These results highlight the transformative potential of artificial intelligence for enhancing radio detection sensitivity and inaugurate a new generation of fully self-triggered cosmic-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Probing the Origins I: Generalised Additive Model inference of birth radii for Milky Way stars in the solar vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to address the limitations inherent in radial metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models, thereby facilitating the estimation of birth radii for the thin disc stars in our sample based on their ages and chemical composition. We then juxtapose the birth radius predictions derived from the GAM with the calculated guiding radii, among other dynamic parameters. Metal-rich stars, formed in the inner regions of the Milky Way, seem to be predominantly churned outward. Their metal-poor counterparts, formed in the outer thin disc, exhibit the opposite behaviour. The proportion of blurred/undisturbed stars generally increases with decreasing metallicity when compared to their churned counterparts. Approximately $3/4$ of the sample has been affected by (inward or outward) churning, while the remaining $\sim 1/4$ has either been influenced by blurring or remained undisturbed. These percentages vary considerably across different metallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between churned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being the outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the youngest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages. We also detect significant differences in angular momenta in the $z$ component, for stars that have either churned inward or outward, when compared to their blurred/undisturbed counterparts. Additionally, we observe the potential effects of the pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in our most metal-poor subset of stars, formed in the outer disc. Finally, we estimate that the Sun's most probable birth radius is $7.08 \pm 0.24$ kpc, with a 3$\sigma$ range spanning from 6.46 to 7.81 kpc, in agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Searching for additional structure and redshift evolution in the observed binary black hole population with a parametric time-dependent mass distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population of the observed gravitational wave events encodes unique information on the formation and evolution of stellar-mass black holes, from the underlying astrophysical processes to the large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We use the ICAROGW analysis infrastructure to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on the gravitational wave signals from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third observing run, O3. Searching for additional structure and redshift evolution in the primary mass distribution, we explore the dependence of the mass spectrum reconstruction on different parametrizations and prior choices. For the stationary case, we find strong evidence (Bayes factor $B \simeq 180$) that the results obtained using a power-law model with a peak (Powerlaw-Gaussian)--the model preferred so far in the literature--are sensitive to prior bounds, affecting the resolvability of the $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$ peak. This behaviour is reproduced by simulated data, indicating a bimodal structure in the likelihood. Models with three mass features simultaneously capture a sharp $\sim 10M_{\odot}$ peak, a $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$ overdensity, and support for a $\sim 20 M_{\odot}$ overdensity preceded by a dip. Among these, a model with three power-law peaks (Powerlaw-Powerlaw-Powerlaw) is equally favored, in terms of evidence, over the Powerlaw-Gaussian model with wide priors. We find no statistical support for redshift evolution in the current data and provide constraints on the parameters governing this evolution, showing consistency with stationarity. We highlight possible limitations of the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework in reconstructing evolving features outside the detector horizon. Our work lays the foundations for a robust characterization of time-dependent population distributions, with significant implications for black hole astrophysics and gravitational wave cosmology.</description>

      <title>Classifying spectra of emission-line regions with neural networks -- An application to integral field spectroscopic data of M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission-line regions are key to understanding the properties of galaxies, as they trace the exchange of matter and energy between stars and the interstellar medium (ISM). In nearby galaxies, individual nebulae can be identified as HII regions, planetary nebulae (PNe), supernova remnants (SNR), and diffuse ionised gas (DIG) with criteria on single or multiple emission-line ratios. However, these methods are limited by rigid classification boundaries, the narrow scope of information they are based upon, and the inability to account for line-of-sight nebular superpositions. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to classify these regions using their optical spectra. Our training set consists of simulated spectra, obtained from photoionisation and shock models, and processed to match observations obtained with MUSE. We evaluate the performance of the network on simulated spectra for a range of signal-to-noise (S/N) levels and dust extinction, and the superposition of different nebulae along the line of sight. At infinite S/N the network achieves perfect predictive performance, while as the S/N decreases, the classification accuracy declines, reaching an average of ~80% at S/N(H$\alpha$)=20. We apply our model to real spectra from MUSE observations of the galaxy M33, where it provides a robust classification of individual spaxels, even at low S/N, identifying HII regions and PNe and distinguishing them from SNRs and diffuse ionized gas, while identifying overlapping nebulae. We then compare the network's classification with traditional diagnostics and find satisfactory agreement. Using activation maximisation maps, we find that at high S/N the model mainly relies on weak lines (e.g. auroral lines of metal ions and He recombination lines), while at the S/N level typical of our dataset the model effectively emulates traditional diagnostic methods by leveraging strong nebular lines.</description>

      <title>Ariel stellar characterisation III. Fast rotators and new FGK stars in the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next mission dedicated to the study of planetary atmospheres is the Ariel space mission, planned for launch in 2029, which will observe a variety of planetary systems belonging to different classes around stars with spectral types from M to A. To optimise the scientific outcome of the mission, such stars need to be homogeneously characterised beforehand. In this work, we focus on a methodology based on spectral synthesis for the characterisation of FGK-type stars from the Ariel Tier 1 Mission Candidate Sample (MCS) which exhibit fast rotation. In addition, we analyse slow-rotating FGK-type stars, with either new observations or archival spectra available, consistently as in our previous work using the equivalent width (EW) analysis. To ensure consistency between our methods, we re-analysed a sample of FGK-type stars with the spectral synthesis method and compared it to our previous work. The results of our analysis show excellent agreement with the previous set of derived parameters. We also computed their orbital parameters establishing whether they belong to the Galactic thin or thick discs. With the current set of stellar parameters, we almost double the analysed hosts in the Ariel MCS to 353 stars in total. Using our homogeneous set of stellar parameters, we studied the correlations between stellar and planetary properties for the Ariel MCS analysed so far. We confirmed a close relationship between stellar mass (up to 1.8 solar masses) and giant planet radius, with more inflated planets at lower metallicity. We confirm that giant planets are more frequent around more metal-rich stars that belong to the thin disc, while lower-mass planets are also found in more metal-poor environments, and are more frequent than giant planets in the thick disc as also seen in other works in the literature.</description>

      <title>Target Selection for the Redshift-Limited WAVES-Wide with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming Wide Area Vista Extragalactic Survey (WAVES) on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) has a key science goal of probing the halo mass function to lower limits than possible with previous surveys. For that purpose, in its Wide component, galaxies targetted by WAVES will be flux-limited to $Z&lt;21.1$ mag and will cover the redshift range of $z&lt;0.2$, at a spectroscopic success rate of $\sim95\%$. Meeting this completeness requirement, when the redshift is unknown a priori, is a challenge. We solve this problem with supervised machine learning to predict the probability of a galaxy falling within the WAVES-Wide redshift limit, rather than estimate each object's redshift. This is done by training an XGBoost tree-based classifier to decide if a galaxy should be a target or not. Our photometric data come from 9-band VST+VISTA observations, including KiDS+VIKING surveys. The redshift labels for calibration are derived from an extensive spectroscopic sample overlapping with KiDS and ancillary fields. Our current results indicate that with our approach, we should be able to achieve the completeness of $\sim95\%$, which is the WAVES success criterion.</description>

      <title>A Deep Neural Network Approach to Compact Source Removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysing extended emission in photometric observations of star-forming regions requires maps free from compact foreground, embedded, and background sources, which can interfere with various techniques used to characterise the interstellar medium. Within the framework of the NEMESIS project, we apply machine learning techniques to improve our understanding of the star formation timescales, which involves the unbiased analysis of the extended emission in these regions. We present a deep learning-based method for separating the signals of compact sources and extended emission in photometric observations made by the Herschel Space Observatory, facilitating the analysis of extended emission and improving the photometry of compact sources. Central to our approach is a modified U-Net architecture with partial convolutional layers. This method enables effective source removal and background estimation across various flux densities, using a series of partial convolutional layers, batch normalisation, and ReLU activation layers within blocks. Our training process utilised simulated sources injected into Herschel images, with controlled flux densities against known backgrounds. A dynamic, signal-to-noise ratio-based adaptive masking system was implemented to assess how prominently a compact source stands out from the surrounding background. The results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the photometric accuracy in the presence of highly fluctuating backgrounds. Moreover, the approach can preserve all characteristics of the images, including the noise properties. The presented approach allows users to analyse extended emission without the interference of disturbing point sources or perform more precise photometry of sources located in complex environments. We also provide a Python tool with tutorials and examples to help the community effectively utilise this method.</description>

      <title>Predicting High-magnification Events in Microlensed Quasars in the Era of LSST using Recurrent Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Upcoming widefield surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will monitor thousands of strongly lensed quasars over a 10 yr period. Many of these monitored quasars will undergo high-magnification events (HMEs) through microlensing, as the accretion disk crosses a caustic, places of infinite magnification. Microlensing allows us to map the inner regions of the accretion disk as it crosses a caustic, even at large cosmological distances. The observational cadences of LSST are not ideal for probing the inner regions of the accretion disk, so there is a need to predict HMEs as early as possible, to trigger high-cadence multiband or spectroscopic follow-up observations. Here, we simulate a diverse and realistic sample of 10 yr quasar microlensing light curves to train a recurrent neural network to predict HMEs before they occur, by classifying the locations of the peaks at each time step. This is the first deep-learning approach for predicting HMEs. We give estimates of how well we expect to predict HME peaks during LSST and benchmark how our metrics change with different cadence strategies. With LSST-like observations, we can predict approximately 55% of HME peaks, corresponding to tens to hundreds per year and a false-positive rate of around 20% compared to the total number of HMEs. Our network can be continuously applied throughout the LSST survey, providing crucial alerts for optimizing follow-up resources.</description>

      <title>PSR J1922+37: a 1.9-second pulsar discovered in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More than 300 pulsars have been discovered in Galactic globular clusters; however, none have been found in open clusters. Here we present results from 20-hour pulsar searching observations in seven open clusters with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our first discovery is a 1.9-second pulsar (J1922+37) found in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791. The measured dispersion measure (DM) implies a distance of 4.79 kpc and 8.92 kpc based on the NE2001 and YMW16 electron density models, respectively. Given the large uncertainty of DM distance estimates, it is likely that PSR J1922+37 is indeed a member of NGC 6791, for which the distance is $4.19\pm0.02$ kpc based on Gaia Data Release 3. If confirmed, PSR J1922+37 will be the first pulsar found in Galactic open clusters. We outline future observations that can confirm this pulsar-open cluster association and discuss the general prospects of finding pulsars in open clusters.</description>
