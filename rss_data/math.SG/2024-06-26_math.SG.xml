      <title>The $p$-adic Jaynes-Cummings model in symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of classical $p$-adic integrable system on a $p$-adic symplectic manifold was proposed by Voevodsky, Warren and the second author a decade ago in analogy with the real case. In the present paper we introduce and study, from the viewpoint of symplectic geometry and topology, the basic properties of the $p$-adic version of the classical Jaynes-Cummings model. The Jaynes-Cummings model is a fundamental example of integrable system going back to the work of Jaynes and Cummings in the 1960s, and which applies to many physical situations, for instance in quantum optics and quantum information theory. Several of our results depend on the value of $p$: the structure of the model depends on the class of the prime $p$ modulo $4$ and $p=2$ requires special treatment.</description>

      <title>Transversality for perturbed special Lagrangian submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for the moduli space of perturbed special Lagrangian submanifolds in a 6-dimensional manifold equipped with a generalization of a Calabi-Yau structure. These perturbed special Lagrangian submanifolds arise as solutions to an infinite-dimensional Lagrange multipliers problem which is part of a proposal for counting special Lagrangians outlined by Donaldson and Segal in their paper Gauge theory in higher dimensions II. More specifically, we prove that this moduli space is generically a set of isolated points.</description>

      <title>A symplectic Hilbert-Smith conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new cases of the Hilbert-Smith conjecture for actions by natural homeomorphisms in symplectic topology. Specifically, we prove that the group of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb Z_p$ does not admit non-trivial continuous actions by Hamiltonian homeomorphisms, the $C^0$ limits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, on symplectically aspherical symplectic manifolds. For a class of symplectic manifolds, including all standard symplectic tori, we deduce that a locally compact group acting faithfully by homeomorphisms in the $C^0$ closure of time-one maps of symplectic isotopies must be a Lie group. Our methods of proof differ from prior approaches to the question and involve barcodes and power operations in Floer cohomology. They also apply to other natural metrics in symplectic topology, notably Hofer's metric. An appendix by Leonid Polterovich uses this to deduce obstructions on Hamiltonian actions by semi-simple $p$-adic analytic groups.</description>
