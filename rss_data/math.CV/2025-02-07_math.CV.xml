      <title>On the extension of analytic solutions of first-order difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will consider first-order difference equations of the form \[ y(z+1) = \frac{\lambda y(z)+a_2(z)y(z)^2+\cdots+a_p(z)y(z)^p}{1 + b_1(z)y(z)+\cdots+b_q(z)y(z)^q}, \]
  where $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ and the coefficients $a_j(z)$ and $b_k(z)$ are meromorphic.
  When existence of an analytic solution can be proved for large negative values of $\Re(z)$, the equation determines a unique extension to a global meromorphic solution. In this paper we prove the existence of non-constant meromorphic solutions when the coefficients satisfy $|a_{j}(z)|\leq \nu^{|z|}$ and $|b_{k}(z)|\leq \nu^{|z|}$ for some $\nu&lt;|\lambda|$ in a half-plane. Furthermore, when a solution exists that is analytic for large positive values of $\Re(z)$, the equation determines a unique extension to a global solution that will generically have algebraic branch points. We analyse a particular constant coefficient equation, $y(z+1)=\lambda y(z)+y(z)^2$, $0&lt;\lambda&lt;1$, and describe in detail the infinitely-sheeted Riemann surface for such a solution. We also describe solutions with natural boundaries found by Mahler.</description>

      <title>Introducing a Novel Subclass of Harmonic Functions with Close-to-Convex Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new subclass of close-to-convex harmonic functions. We present a sufficient coefficient condition for a function to be a member of this class. Furthermore, we establish a distortion theorem. These results lay the groundwork for extending the findings to function classes involving higher-order derivatives.</description>

      <title>Modular companions in planar one-dimensional equisymmetric strata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider, in the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of a fixed genus, the subset of surfaces with non-trivial automorphisms. Of special interest are the numerous subsets of surfaces admitting an action of a given finite group, $G$, acting with a specific signature. In a previous study we declared two Riemann surfaces to be \emph{modular companions} if they have topologically equivalent $G$ actions, and that their $G$ quotients are conformally equivalent orbifolds. In this article we present a geometrically-inspired measure to decide whether two modular companions are conformally equivalent (or how different), respecting the $G$ action. Along the way, we construct a moduli space for surfaces with the specified $G$ action and associated equivariant tilings on these surfaces. We specifically apply the ideas to planar, finite group actions whose quotient orbifold is a sphere with four cone points.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and explicit form of linear Hermite--Chebyshev approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, relying on known results on consistent Hermite-Pad\'e approximations of a system of trigonometric series, sufficient conditions are found under which linear Hermite-Chebyshev approximations exist and are determined uniquely. When the found conditions are met, formulas describing the explicit form of the numerators and denominator of linear Hermite-Pad\'e approximations for a system of functions that are sums of Fourier series with respect to Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind are obtained.</description>

      <title>Log continuity of solutions of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold whose anticanonical cohomology class is semipositive. Let $L$ be a big and semi-ample line bundle on $X$ and $\alpha$ be the Chern class of $L$. We give a sufficient condition ensuring that the solution of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in $\alpha$ with $L^p$ right-hand side ($p&gt;1$) is $\log^M$-continuous for every constant $M&gt;0$. As an application, we show that every singular Ricci-flat metric in a semi-ample integral class in a projective Calabi-Yau surface $X$ is globally $\log^M$-continuous with respect to a smooth metric on $X$.</description>

      <title>On a problem of Pavlovi\'{c} involving harmonic quasiconformal mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a sharp result on the order of harmonic quasiconformal mappings with bounded Schwarzian norm. This problem is motivated by the work of Chuaqui, Hern\'{a}ndez and Mart\'{i}n [Math. Ann. 367: 1099--1122, 2017]. Firstly, for $K\ge1$, we construct a harmonic $K$-quasiconformal counterpart of the classical Koebe function and use it to formulate the corresponding conjectures. Then we consider Hardy spaces $H^p$ of harmonic quasiconformal mappings by applying results for quasiconformal mappings obtained by Astala and Koskela [Pure Appl. Math. Q. 7: 19--50, 2011]. In particular, we determine the optimal order of the family of harmonic quasiconformal mappings with bounded Schwarzian norm to belong to a harmonic Hardy space. This partially solves an open problem posed by Pavlovi\'{c} in 2014. Finally, we derive pre-Schwarzian and Schwarzian norm estimates of certain harmonic mappings.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with trivial Chern classes II: Manifolds Isogenous to a Torus Product, coframed Manifolds and a question by Baldassarri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a general question addressed by Mario Baldassarri in 1956, we discuss characterizations of the Pseudo-Abelian Varieties introduced by Roth, and we introduce a first new notion, of Manifolds Isogenous to a k-Torus Product: the latter have the last k Chern classes trivial in rational cohomology and vanishing Chern numbers. We show that in dimension 2 the latter class is the correct substitute for some incorrect assertions by Enriques, Dantoni, Roth and Baldassarri: these are the surfaces with $K_X$ nef and $c_2(X)=0 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$. We observe in the last section, using a construction by Chad Schoen, that such a simple similar picture does not hold in higher dimension. We discuss then, as a class of solutions to Baldassarri's question, manifolds isogenous to projective (respectively: K\"ahler) manifolds whose tangent bundle or whose cotangent bundle has a trivial subbundle of positive rank. We see that the class of `partially framed' projective manifolds (that is, whose tangent bundle has a trivial subbundle) consists, in the case where $K_X$ is nef, of the Pseudo-Abelian varieties of Roth; while the class of `partially co-framed' projective manifolds is not yet fully understood in spite of the new results that we are able to show here: and we formulate some open questions and conjectures. In the course of the paper we address also the case of more general compact complex Manifolds, introducing the new notions of suspensions over parallelizable Manifolds, of twisted hyperelliptic Manifolds, and we describe the known results under the K\"ahler assumption.</description>
