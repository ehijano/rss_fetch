      <title>Complex Magnetic Behavior in RuO$_2$ Thin Films: Strain, Surface Effects, and Altermagnetic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RuO$_2$ has been proposed as a prototypical metallic $d$-wave altermagnet, a N\'eel-ordered compensated antiferromagnetic state exhibiting nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting; yet, its magnetic ground state remains controversial both theoretically and experimentally. Using comprehensive first-principles calculations, we investigate RuO$_2$ thin films with (110), (100), and (001) orientations, both freestanding and supported on a TiO$_2$ substrate. We show that magnetism in RuO$_2$ thin films is highly fragile, strongly influenced by strain, surface orientation, and atomic relaxation, while also being highly sensitive to the choice of the Brillouin-zone integration scheme. Although tensile strain induces finite magnetic moments, none of the studied systems stabilizes a compensated antiferromagnetic state; hence, an altermagnetic ground state cannot be achieved. Instead, the magnetic response is characterized by pronounced layer- and site-dependent variations and incomplete moment compensation, resembling a ferrimagnetic-like state. Our results reconcile conflicting theoretical and experimental reports and underscore the sensitivity of RuO$_2$ magnetism to structural and methodological details.</description>

      <title>Eutectic and peritectic equilibria in coherent binary alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the Cahn--Larch\'e thermodynamic framework to binary alloys in which two coherent solid phases coexist with an incoherent liquid and investigates how coherency strain energy modifies classical eutectic and peritectic equilibria. We derive equilibrium conditions for three-phase coexistence that include an elastic energy term dependent on the molar fractions of the solid phases and apply them to model binary eutectic and peritectic systems. We find that coherency stress transforms the eutectic point into a finite three-phase equilibrium field spanning a continuous range of compositions and temperatures. In contrast, coherency stress in peritectic systems progressively destabilizes the two-solid equilibrium without generating a stable three-phase field and can suppress the peritectic reaction entirely. This asymmetry is governed by the geometric relationship between the stress-free compositions of the phases: when the liquid composition lies between those of the two solids (eutectic configuration), the liquid serves as a thermodynamic buffer against the coherency penalty on the solid--solid pair; when it lies outside (peritectic configuration), no such mechanism is available. These results demonstrate that coherency stress can fundamentally alter three-phase equilibria involving a liquid and suggest that such effects may be significant in systems with large coherent misfits.</description>

      <title>A brief review of high-entropy oxides in solid oxide fuel cell applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid oxide fuel cells are efficient energy conversion devices essential to clean energy development, yet their broad application is limited by material challenges, including sluggish oxygen reduction kinetics at intermediate temperatures, electrode instability and vulnerability to contaminants. High-entropy oxides, a novel class of materials characterized by multiple principal elements and high configurational entropy, present a promising approach to overcome these issues via their distinctive "four core effects". This review begins with the fundamentals of high-entropy materials, covering their definition, phase stabilization mechanisms, and relevant descriptors, then systematically reviews their progress as SOFC cathodes, electrolytes, and anodes. Key advances are summarized, and current challenges are analyzed, offering guidance for the design of high-performance and stable high-entropy oxides for solid oxide fuel cells.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic low-spin state and strain-tunable anomalous Hall scaling in high-quality SrRuO3 (111) films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (111)-oriented 4d ferromagnetic perovskite SrRuO3 (SRO) offers a unique triangular-lattice geometry, making it a promising platform for exploring Berry-curvature-driven and spin-orbit-coupled transport. Here, we present a systematic study of the structure, magnetism, and magnetotransport of high-quality SRO (111) thin films with thicknesses t = 1.2-60 nm grown on SrTiO3 (111) substrates by machine-learning-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. We achieved a residual resistivity ratio of 45.5 in a 60 nm-thick film, the highest reported for this orientation, enabling access to intrinsic electronic and magnetic behavior. Temperature-dependent resistivity confirms Fermi-liquid transport below 15 K in both coherently strained (t = 10, 20 nm) and strain-relaxed (t = 60 nm) films, thereby enabling detailed magnetotransport and magnetic measurements. The linear, non-saturating positive magnetoresistance persists up to 14 T, while Hall-effect measurements and temperature scaling separate intrinsic (Karplus-Luttinger) and extrinsic (side-jump) contributions to the anomalous Hall effect, with the relative weight tuned by (111) epitaxial strain. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Ru M2,3 and O K edges, together with SQUID magnetometry, demonstrates an intrinsically low-spin Ru ground state for both coherently strained and relaxed films, resolving ambiguities among prior reports. These detailed crystalline, electrical, and magnetic characterizations provide a rigorous foundation for understanding and engineering quantum transport in SRO (111).</description>

      <title>On the origin of in-gap states in amorphous Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localized states in the band gap of amorphous phase change alloys like Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ control the electrical conduction via the Poole-Frenkel mechanism. Understanding the origin of in-gap states and their evolution in time during aging of the glass is therefore important for the control of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices. Here, we use a machine learning interatomic potential to generate several models of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ whose electronic structure is then analyzed within density functional theory with a hybrid functional. A detailed statistical analysis of the structural motifs on which the in-gap states are localized, reveals that the vast majority of in-gap states involve wrong bonds (homopolar or Ge-Sb bonds) often accompanied by Ge in tetrahedral configurations or overcoordinated Ge and Sb atoms. Metadynamics simulations mimicking glass aging support the picture that structural relaxations lead to the depletion of in-gap states and then to an increase of resistance. The simulations thus provide important insights for the mitigation of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic Pressure-enhanced correlated magnetism and Chern insulator in moir'e WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e semiconductors offer flat bands where Coulomb interactions and band topology intertwine, while interlayer coupling plays a central role in forming the moir\'e potential. However, limited interlayer coupling strength and the lack of efficient tuning methods hinder further exploration of correlated phenomena in moir\'e semiconductors. Here we introduce a cryogenic dual-gated diamond-anvil platform using helium as a pressure medium, enabling reversible hydrostatic tuning together with magneto-optical spectroscopy in twisted bilayer WSe2. Pressure enhances the moir\'e potential, redshifts excitons, and stabilizes Stoner ferromagnetism otherwise absent at a 3.1-degree twist. Simultaneously, the half-filled C = 1 Chern insulating state strengthens, exhibiting a reduced saturation field. Moreover, we observe a topological phase transition from a Chern insulator to a Mott insulator at around 2 GPa. First-principles calculations reveal that a Gamma-to-K valence-band-maximum switching drives this transition by converting an Ising-like topological K-valley miniband into a spin-degenerate trivial Gamma miniband. Our findings demonstrate hydrostatic pressure as a powerful, continuous control axis for correlated magnetism and topological band engineering in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Reactive Coarse Grained Force Field for Metal-Organic Frameworks applied to Modeling ZIF-8 Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding the self-assembly mechanism of metal-organic frameworks is a crucial step in reducing trial-and-error tests in their synthesis protocols. Atomistic simulations have proven essential in revealing molecular-level features of MOF nucleation, but they still exhibit limitations in the simulation setups due to size constraints (inability of reaching realistic concentrations or exploring non-stoichiometric metal:ligand ratios). In this contribution, we develop a methodology to derive reactive coarse grained force fields based on multiscale coarse graining methods. We apply our novel methodology to the case of the archetypal zeolitic-imidazolate framework ZIF-8. Our coarse grained force field, which we call nb-CG-ZIF-FF, does not contain any explicit connectivity information, but learns the tetrahedral Zn-connectivity from many body correlations within an atomistic benchmark. nb-CG-ZIF-FF quantitatively reproduces the features of bulk, crystalline ZIF-8 as well as the structural evolution of pre-nucleation species in terms of Zn n-fold coordination populations from the atomistic benchmark. While the range of rings that are formed along the synthesis process are well captured by nb-CG-ZIF-FF, the model cannot exactly reproduce ring populations. Our reactive CG force field fitting approach can be applied to any MOF, opening new research avenues in modeling MOF formation, decomposition, defect dynamics and phase transition processes.</description>

      <title>Neel temperature and helical spin order of altermagnetic RuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic groundstate of RuO$_2$ remains controversial, with experimental evidence for a nonmagnetic groundstate of ideal bulk material and indications of a magnetic state in strained thin films. Here, I investigate the N\'eel temperature of the (hypothetical) altermagnetic state of bulk RuO$_2$, stabilized via the DFT$+U$ technique, by mapping on a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The N\'eel temperature scales monotonously with the magnetic moment up to the point where a large $+U$ term opens a band gap and turns RuO$_2$ semiconducting. The maximum N\'eel temperature obtained by this procedure is 408\,K at $U=3$\,eV, and much smaller values for smaller $U$. A reciprocal-space eigenvalue analysis reveals a helimagnetic groundstate of the spin model due to intra-sublattice antiferromagnetic coupling. This situation resembles the isostructural $\beta$-MnO$_2$, which is a prototype helimagnet. Further comparison with calculations on CrO$_2$ and altermagnetic MnF$_2$ taking $U$ as an adjustable parameter supports the validity of the spin model analysis.</description>

      <title>Planar Structures of Medium-Sized Gold Clusters Become Ground States upon Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural stability of ionized gold clusters of sizes ranging from 22 to 100 atoms, contrasting compact, cage and planar structures. While it is well known that neutral clusters in the upper part of this size range predominantly favor compact structures, our results reveal that positively ionized gold clusters exhibit structural transitions in which planar structures become energetically preferred once the charge is sufficiently large. In addition, we study the finite-temperature stability of the structures and find that thermodynamic effects further stabilize planar configurations relative to their compact counterparts. To explore the potential energy surface, we use the Minima Hopping algorithm combined with a machine-learned potential. Since the machine-learned potential does not apply to ionized clusters, we introduce a charge-correction term to incorporate Coulomb interactions and charge screening.</description>

      <title>Revealing 3D Strain and Carbide Architectures in Additively Manufactured Ni Superalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast directional solidification during Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) produces a complex microstructure in nickel-based superalloys, comprising columnar grains with cellular sub-grain structures and carbides. Using non-destructive Scanning 3D X-ray Diffraction (S3DXRD), we reveal spatially complex orientation and intergranular strain relationships that couple strongly to processing-induced cellular sub-grain networks and a primary cubic metal carbide (MC) phase. We have examined 3D orientation and elastic strain tensor fields across 82 $\gamma$ grains together with the spatial distribution of over 37,000 MC carbides in an ABD-900AM alloy sample manufactured by the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) LAM process. Carbides are spatially associated with the cellular sub-grain network with a weak but present orientation relationship with their parent $\gamma$ grains. The MC carbides, known to be Ti, Ta and Nb rich, form in regions of high solute segregation, resulting in a significant volumetric lattice parameter patterning in the associated $\gamma$ phase regions. These chemically distinct solute-rich regions possess a higher associated elastic modulus compared to intercellular regions and determine the local residual stress patterning. These results provide the first non-destructive 3D study of the relationship between rapid solidification-induced segregation, deformation heterogeneity and carbide architectures in an additively manufactured Ni-based superalloy. The insights provide crucial detail to rationalise LAM process parameter optimisation and the coupled spatially governed structural performance.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Optical-Electrical Simulation of Cs2AgBiBr6 Double Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in lead-free perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a balance among environmental safety and high optoelectronic performance remains challenging. The inorganic double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its robust three-dimensional crystal structure and suitable visible-range bandgap. However, best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells reported so far - 6.37% experimentally and 27.78% in numerical studies - remain below the theoretical performance potential, largely due to suboptimal charge transport layers, and interface-related recombination losses. Here, we address this gap using a 3D finite-element method (FEM) implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics, which couples optical simulations with semiconductor drift-diffusion transport. To our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive 3D FEM-based study of a double halide perovskite solar cell. Screening of 25 electron transport layer (ETL)-hole transport layer (HTL) combinations identifies CeO2 and P3HT as the optimal ETL and HTL respectively. Device performance is further analyzed through systematic variation of layer thicknesses, doping concentrations and defect densities within the FTO/CeO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/P3HT/Au architecture. Under optimized parameters, the simulated device achieves a PCE of 31.76%, representing the theoretical upper bound predicted by the model. Overall, this work demonstrates 3D physics-based device engineering as a decisive pathway for overcoming efficiency bottlenecks in lead-free double perovskite photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Transferable Learning of Reaction Pathways from Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying minimum-energy paths (MEPs) is crucial for understanding chemical reaction mechanisms but remains computationally demanding. We introduce MEPIN, a scalable machine-learning method for efficiently predicting MEPs from reactant and product configurations, without relying on transition-state geometries or pre-optimized reaction paths during training. The task is defined as predicting deviations from geometric interpolations along reaction coordinates. We address this task with a continuous reaction path model based on a symmetry-broken equivariant neural network that generates a flexible number of intermediate structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective, with efficiency enhanced by incorporating geometric priors from geodesic interpolation as initial interpolations or pre-training objectives. Our approach generalizes across diverse chemical reactions and achieves accurate alignment with reference intrinsic reaction coordinates, as demonstrated on various small molecule reactions and [3+2] cycloadditions. Our method enables the exploration of large chemical reaction spaces with efficient, data-driven predictions of reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion-Based Sampling with Molecular Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11923v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data. Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes. Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency, mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in molecular sciences.</description>

      <title>Full-Field Damage Monitoring in Architected Lattices Using In situ Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables non-invasive, spatially continuous reconstruction of internal conductivity distributions, providing full field sensing beyond conventional point measurements. Here, we report the first in situ implementation of EIT within a tunable architected lattice materials framework, enabling systematic exploration across a broad lattice design space while achieving real time monitoring of damage evolution, including early stage, prefracture events, in 3D printed multifunctional lattice composites. Lattices are designed via Voronoi based branch trunk branch motifs inspired by 2D wallpaper symmetries and fabricated using CNT infused photocurable resins, with nanoscale filler dispersion confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Sixteen electrodes distributed along the lattice periphery enable EIT measurements during quasi static tensile loading. Conductivity maps reconstructed using adjacent and across current injection schemes resolve sequential ligament fracture with high temporal resolution, with localised conductivity loss quantitatively coinciding with fracture sites, including regions remote from electrodes. Architectural tunability allows systematic control of EIT imaging sensitivity to early stage damage, while pronounced resistance discontinuities at failure further corroborate spatial localisation; global end to end resistance measurements complement macroscopic stress strain responses. Collectively, these results establish in situ EIT as a scalable, full field sensing modality for architected multifunctional materials, providing an experimentally validated pathway toward autonomous, intelligent materials and data rich material states that can inform digital twin frameworks for structural, biomedical, and energy related applications.</description>

      <title>High-throughput screening and mechanistic insights into solid acid proton conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton-conducting solid acids could enable water-free operation of high-temperature fuel cells. However, systematic materials screening has, hitherto, been computationally prohibitive. Here, we introduce a two-stage high-throughput screening strategy that directly computes proton diffusion coefficients, enabled by machine-learned interatomic potentials fine-tuned to ab initio data. Starting from more than six million materials, our screening -- based on structural motifs rather than empirical descriptors -- identifies $27$ high-performing proton conductors, including over ten previously unexplored compounds. These include sustainable and commercially available materials, candidates that have not yet been synthesized, organic systems that fall outside conventional design rules, and known proton conductors that validate our approach. Importantly, our findings reveal a universal oxygen--oxygen distance of approximately $2.5$~{\AA} at the moment of proton transfer across diverse chemistries, providing mechanistic insight and showing that macroscopic proton conductivity emerges from the interplay between anion rotational dynamics, hydrogen-bond network connectivity, and proton-transfer probability.</description>

      <title>Photoionization of temperature-controlled nanoparticles in a beam: Accurate and efficient determination of ionization energies and work functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A beam of free alkali metal nanoparticles is produced by a condensation source, passed through a thermalizing tube adjustable over a broad temperature range, and ionized by tunable light. High stability of the particle flux and an automated data acquisition routine allow efficient collection of photoionization yield curves. A careful fit of the data to the universal Fowler function makes it possible to obtain nanoparticle ionization energies, and from those, the metal work functions, with $\sim$0.2% precision. The experimental arrangement, nanoparticle thermalization rates, and ionization threshold analysis are described in detail. The use of ultrapure and temperature-controlled gas-phase nanoparticles facilitates the analysis of electronic properties, such as work functions, and of their interplay with thermal lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent photoionization thresholds of alkali-metal nanoparticles reveal thermal expansion and the melting transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precision measurement of the photoionization of pure sodium and potassium nanoparticles isolated in a beam enabled an accurate determination of their work functions as a function of temperature. In addition to resolving and quantifying the initial gradual decrease of the work function with temperature, which is associated with thermal expansion, the experiment revealed that the work function then undergoes a distinct drop both in magnitude and in slope that signifies the onset of nanoparticle melting. This establishes that a structural phase transition can be detected via a high-resolution measurement of the photoemission threshold. The melting temperature of nanoparticles with diameters of 7-9 nm is reduced by nearly 100 K relative to the bulk value. This suppression aligns with predictions from the Gibbs-Thomson equation which describes finite-size phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Isotope effect in the work function of lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work functions of 7Li and 6Li metals have been measured as a function of temperature, by using photoionization of pure isolated metal nanoparticles in a beam. These data reveal a marked isotope effect in the temperature variation of these work functions. Furthermore, for both isotopes the curvature of this temperature variation is found to be significantly larger than may be ascribed purely to a change in the electron gas density. These findings enhance the characterization of lithium as a quantum material in which the interplay between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom is nontrivial, and call for a microscopic understanding beyond simple models. Additionally, the slope of the work function curves was observed to vanish in the low temperature limit, as had been predicted on the basis of the Third Law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-tuned consecutive topological phase transitions between distinct correlated insulators in moire MoTe2/WSe2 heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consecutive topological phase transitions (TPTs) between strongly correlated electronic phases that differ simultaneously in symmetry breaking and topological order are of fundamental interest in condensed matter physics, yet are rarely realized experimentally. We report two consecutive electric-field-driven TPTs at half filling (nu = 1) in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moire heterobilayers. With increasing out-of-plane displacement field, a geometrically frustrated Mott insulator evolves into a ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) Mott insulator, i.e., a spin-polarized topological Mott insulator without an observable charge-gap closure, and subsequently into an antiferromagnetic, valley-coherent Mott insulator (VC-AFM) accompanied by a continuous charge-gap collapse and the emergence of a critical metallic state. Layer-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magneto-transport, and compressibility measurements jointly determine the phase diagram. The high-field evolution of the antiferromagnetic state reveals a metamagnetic-like transition at a critical field B*, above which a Chern insulating transport response reappears. Our results establish the MoTe2/WSe2 moire platform as a tunable realization of an extended Kane-Mele-Hubbard model hosting sequential correlation-topology-intertwined transitions.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Liquid $T^2$ Resistivity: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Meets Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct-current resistivity is a key probe for the physical properties of materials. In metals, Fermi-liquid (FL) theory serves as the basis for understanding transport. A $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity is often taken as a signature of FL electron-electron scattering. However, the presence of impurity and phonon scattering as well as material-specific aspects such as Fermi surface geometry can complicate this interpretation. We demonstrate how density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory can be used to elucidate the FL regime. We take as examples SrVO$_{3}$ and SrMoO$_{3}$, two moderately correlated perovskite oxides, and establish a precise framework to analyze the FL behavior of the self-energy at low energy and temperature. Reviewing published low-temperature resistivity measurements, we find agreement between our calculations and experiments performed on samples with exceptionally low residual resistivity. This comparison emphasizes the need for further theoretical, synthesis, and characterization developments in these and other FL materials.</description>

      <title>Linking the pressure dependence of the structure and thermal stability to {\alpha}- and \b{eta}-relaxations in metallic glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glasses derive their functional properties from complex relaxation dynamics that remain enigmatic under extreme conditions. While the temperature dependence of these relaxation processes is well-established, their behavior under high-pressure conditions remains poorly understood due to significant experimental difficulties. In this study, we employ cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr46.8Ti8.2Cu7.5Ni10Be27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the \b{eta}-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without significant density changes. Conversely, {\alpha}-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T/Tg,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermo-mechanical processing.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously Formed Orientation Polarization Thin Films for Engineering Organic-Organic Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of polar molecules is formed in vacuum-deposited films by tilting their permanent dipole moment against the substrate surface direction. In this study, we developed SOP molecules with high structural asymmetry by introducing multiple fluoroalkyl groups into polar molecules because SOP is driven by asymmetric intermolecular interactions on the film surface during the vacuum deposition. The developed polar molecules exhibited high dipole orientation degrees in vacuum-deposited films and achieved a high surface potential growth rate relative to the film thickness, over -350 mV nm-1, which is a record high for the reported compounds. Furthermore, the dipolar layers introduced at organic thin-film interfaces in hole-only devices and organic photovoltaics to study the impact of dipole interlayers on device performance. The characteristics of the device were observed to be significantly influenced by the SOP polarity, suggesting that the SOP at the organic thin-film interface plays a crucial role in charge transfer and energy level alignment. The findings of this study provide methodologies for the formation of highly anisotropic glassy films, leading to improved performance of organic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic materials are crucial for manipulating electron spin and magnetic fields, enabling applications in data storage, spintronics, charge transport, and energy conversion, while also providing insight into fundamental quantum phenomena. In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed. Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport. Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Pores Play a Limited Role in Diffusion Through Hydrated Na-MMT: Insights from a Multiscale, Experimentally Anchored Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates interlayer diffusion dynamics in sodium montmorillonite (Na--MMT), a smectite clay widely used in environmental remediation, pharmaceutical formulations, and advanced materials. Understanding diffusion in Na--MMT is critical, yet current models often rely on fitted parameters rather than directly linking transport to microscopic structure; even when the structure is known, interlayer diffusion remains challenging to model. This motivates the development of a predictive, coarse-grained, geometry-based computational framework.
  Our multiscale framework couples atomistic simulations with a coarse-grained mesoscale model to quantify contributions from interlayer one-, two-, and three-water pores, as well as free pores ($&gt;3$-water diameter), across dry densities of $0.8$--$1.3~\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$. Experimentally derived platelet size distributions, polydispersity, and anisotropic transport behavior are explicitly incorporated.
  Results indicate that interlayer pores contribute minimally to overall water diffusion at the studied densities, with transport dominated by free pores. Predicted diffusion scaling factors closely match tritium tracer measurements when interlayer throttling is included, and the model captures the pronounced anisotropy of Na--MMT. Validation against lattice Boltzmann simulations and experiments demonstrates reliable reproduction of geometric tortuosity and pore-size distributions. Despite limitations, including rigid platelets and omission of three-water energy minima, the coarse-grained framework provides a robust platform for understanding nanoconfined diffusion. Future work will focus on refining interlayer energy landscapes and incorporating flexible platelet mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy is crucial for sustaining long range magnetic order in two-dimensional materials (2D) and must be taken into account by any approximate scheme for calculating critical temperatures. While 2D ferromagnets have received significant attention with regard to predicting Curie temperatures, the treatment of 2D anti-ferromagnetism has largely been restricted to classical approaches, which typically underestimate N\'eel temperatures. The concept of anti-ferromagnetism can be regarded as a special case of single-$Q$ magnetic order, and for such systems the critical temperature can be calculated from the magnon dispersion using either Holstein-Primakoff (HP) bosonization or Green's function-based Random Phase Approximation (RPA). Here, we study the effects of single-ion anisotropy in general single-$Q$ systems in both the HP and RPA methods. In the case of RPA, we generalize the approach to include the Callen Decoupling (CD) correction, which has previously been shown to yield good agreement with experimental Curie temperatures for 2D ferromagnets. We compare the calculated critical temperatures of CrI$_3$ (uniaxial ferromagnet), MPS$_3$ (M=Ni, Mn, Fe) (uniaxial anti-ferromagnets) and CrSBr (triaxial ferromagnet) monolayers with experimental values and find that the Green's function-based methods are much more reliable than HP and that the CD decoupling appears to be more accurate than RPA if the single-ion anisotropy is large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in stacked 2D crystals are powerful platforms for engineering correlated and topological quantum phases, with twisted graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as prominent examples. Their angle-sensitive band structures enable rich tunability; however, conventional tear-and-stack methods fix the angle at assembly, limiting systematic exploration of angle-dependent phenomena. Here, we present a scanning-probe-based manipulation scheme that enables in situ, continuous post-fabrication twist control using nanostructured metal rotors. We demonstrate reproducible angle tuning and direct moir\'e imaging across three platforms: graphene, hBN, and encapsulated, air-sensitive MoTe2. Quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) analysis confirms sub-degree precision with minimal induced heterostrain, preserving sample quality even in the marginally twisted regime. Crucially, the device architecture maintains open access to the active region, allowing optical, scanning-probe, and transport measurements. This work enables single-device mapping of the angular phase diagram of moir\'e materials, including the twisted TMD homobilayers.</description>

Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.</description>

Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector controlled charge and spin transport in altermagnetic junctions</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) - magnetic materials that have spin-split bandstructure with zero net spin polarization can be classified as weak or strong depending upon the strength of altermagnetic term in the Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities are analyzed as functions of angle $\theta$ between the N\'eel vectors of the two AMs. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta \to \pi$, while in the weak AM regime it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal (NM) between two AMs leads to Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations in charge conductivity which can be controlled by an applied gate voltage. In the strong regime, transport in AM-NM-AM junctions is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak regime. These results highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be utilized in electronic devices without a need for externally applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional RMSD projections for reaction path visualization and validation</title>

Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimensional projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient aware derivative Gaussian Process. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We demonstrate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a grignard rearrangement, and a bicyclobutadiene rearrangement.</description>

      <title>Spin Splitter and Inverse Effects in Altermagnetic Hybrid Structures</title>

Abstract: We provide a theoretical description of diffusive charge and spin transport in hybrid devices containing altermagnets. Based on recently derived drift--diffusion equations for coupled charge and spin dynamics and general boundary conditions, our approach provides a unified description of the spin-splitter effect, i.e., the conversion of charge currents into spin currents, and its inverse in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We analyze, analytically and numerically, the spin-splitter effect, demonstrating that an injected spin accumulation generates a measurable voltage difference across the transverse direction in the altermagnet. Motivated by a recent experiment, we also analyze a nonlocal spin-valve geometry in which an altermagnetic strip injects spin into a diffusive normal metal. We derive the resulting nonlocal voltage detected by a ferromagnetic electrode as a function of the relative orientation of the N'eel vector and the ferromagnetic polarization, accounting for the main experimental findings. For this setup, we further address spin precession during diffusive transport by analyzing the spin Hanle effect. Our results provide theoretical explanations and predictions for several altermagnet hybrid structures.</description>
