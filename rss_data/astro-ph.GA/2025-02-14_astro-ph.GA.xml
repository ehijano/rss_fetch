      <title>Are binary-star populations regionally different? --in memory of Sverre Aarseth--</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For synthesising star clusters and whole galaxies, stellar populations need to be modelled by a set of four functions that define their initial distribution of stellar masses and of the orbital properties of their binary-star populations. The initial binaries are dynamically processed in different embedded clusters explaining differences in the observed populations. The approach summarised here, for which the Aarseth Nbody codes have been instrumental, allows inference of the initial conditions of the globular cluster omega Cen and the quantification of the stellar merger rate as a function of stellar spectral type, of the role of multiples and mergers for the Cepheid population, and predictions of extragalactic observables. The observability of the four initial distribution functions and their physical and philosophical meaning are also briefly raised. Evidence for the variation of these functions on the physical conditions of star formation and future steps towards extensions to include higher-order multiple systems are touched upon.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: The Evolution of Multi-phase Electron Densities at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of deep $\textit{JWST}$/NIRSpec spectra of star-forming galaxies at $z\simeq1.4-10$, observed as part of the AURORA survey. We infer median low-ionization electron densities of $268_{-49}^{+45}~\rm cm^{-3}$, $350_{-76}^{+140}~\rm cm^{-3}$, and $480_{-310}^{+390}~\rm cm^{-3}$ at redshifts z$=2.3$, $z=3.2$, and $z=5.3$, respectively, revealing an evolutionary trend following $(1+z)^{1.5\pm0.6}$. We identify weak positive correlations between electron density and star formation rate (SFR) as well as SFR surface density, but no significant trends with stellar mass or specific SFR. Correlations with rest-optical emission line ratios show densities increasing with $\rm [NeIII]\lambda3869/[OII]\lambda3727$ and, potentially, $\rm [OIII]\lambda5007/[OII]\lambda3727$, although variations in dust attenuation complicate the latter. Additionally, electron density is more strongly correlated with distance from the local BPT sequence than can be explained by simple photoionization models. We further derive electron densities from the CIII] doublet probing higher-ionization gas, and find a median value of $1.4_{-0.5}^{+0.7}\times10^4~\rm cm^{-3}$, $\sim30$ times higher than densities inferred from [SII]. This comparison suggests a consistent HII region structure across cosmic time with dense, high-ionization interiors surrounded by less dense, low-ionization gas. We compare measurements of AURORA galaxies to predictions from the SPHINX galaxy formations, highlighting the interplay between residual molecular cloud pressure in young galaxies and feedback from stellar winds and supernovae as galaxies mature.</description>

      <title>The low-frequency flattening of the radio spectrum of giant HII regions in M 101</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In galaxies, the flattening of the spectrum at low radio frequencies below 300 MHz has been the subject of some debate. A turnover at low frequencies could be caused by multiple physical processes, which can yield new insights into the properties of the ionised gas in the interstellar medium. We investigate the existence and nature of the low-frequency turnover in the HII regions of M 101. We study the nearby galaxy M 101 using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) at frequencies of 54 and 144 MHz, Apertif at 1370 MHz, and published combined map from the Very Large Array (VLA) and Effelesberg telescope at 4850 MHz. The spectral index between 54 and 144 MHz is inverted at the centres of HII regions. We find a significant low-frequency flattening at the centres of five out of six HII regions that we selected for this study. The low frequency flattening in HII regions of M 101 can be explained with two different free-free absorption models. The flattening is localised in a region smaller than 1.5 kpc and can only be detected with high resolution (better than 45''). The detection of low frequency flattening has important consequences for using radio continuum observations below 100 MHz to measure extinction-free star-formation rates.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Cataclysmic Variables in our Galaxy and Their Position in the HR Diagram in the Gaia Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the distances of stellar systems classified as cataclysmic variables in the literature were determined by using the distance compiled from Bailer-Jones et al. (2021). The spatial distributions of cataclysmic variables in the heliocentric Galactic coordinate system are obtained and their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram constructed from Gaia colors are discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of fresh gas on the Active Galactic Nuclei luminosity of early- and late-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main fuelling processes for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are currently unknown. Previous work showed that galaxies with a large kinematic misalignment between their stellar and gas reservoirs have a higher AGN fraction than galaxies without misalignment. Such misalignment is a strong indication of a past galaxy interaction or an external accretion event. In this work we use integral field spectroscopy data from the SAMI and MaNGA surveys to investigate the AGN luminosity as a function of kinematic misalignment angle. Our sample of AGN exhibit bolometric luminosities in the range 10^40 to 10^43 erg/s, indicative of low to moderate luminosity AGN. We find no correlation between AGN luminosity as a function of misalignment for AGN host galaxies from both surveys. We find some differences between the AGN luminosity of early- and late-type AGN host galaxies (ETGs, LTGs). AGN in LTG hosts have a wider luminosity range, with most LTG hosts showing aligned stellar to gas kinematics. AGN in ETG hosts have a luminosity range that does not depend on misalignment angle, suggesting AGN in ETG hosts are consistent with being fuelled by external accretion events, irrespective of their stellar to gas kinematic misalignment. While all the AGN in ETGs in our sample are consistent with being activated and fuelled by external gas, the range of observed AGN luminosities is likely caused by secondary factors such as the amount of fresh gas brought into the galaxy by the external interaction.</description>

      <title>The long life of ultra diffuse galaxies inside low-density dark matter halos: the case of AGC 114905</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that, in the absence of a dark matter (DM) halo, galaxy discs tend to develop global gravitational instabilities that strongly modify their initial structure. The recent discovery of gas-rich ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) that seem to live in DM halos with very low concentrations, a very atypical configuration in the standard cosmological framework, poses therefore a crucial question: is the small contribution from such DM halos sufficient to stabilize the UDG discs? In this work we investigate this question, focusing on the extreme UDG AGC 114905, which previous works found to be unstable. Here, we revisit these studies, using idealised numerical simulations with AREPO of a system composed by a stellar disc, a gas disc and a DM halo in initial equilibrium with each other and with properties based on slightly revised observational data of AGC 114905. We explore different scenarios for the DM halo and we run our simulations for 5 Gyr. We find that in all cases the stellar and the gas discs are stable and that their initial density distributions and kinematic properties remain unchanged during the course of the simulation. We discuss how the apparent discrepancy with previous works (where the UDG developed instabilities) is due to our discs being dynamically hotter and living in slightly more massive DM halos, in accordance with the new observational constraints, previously unavailable. Our findings demonstrate that AGC 114905 (and likely other similar UDGs) can evolve unperturbed in halos that challenge current cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Cold molecular gas in the hot nuclear wind of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Large Millimeter Telescope and the SEQUOIA 3~mm focal plane array, we have searched for molecular line emission from two atomic clouds associated with the Fermi Bubble of the Milky Way. Neither 12CO nor 13CO J=1-0 emission is detected from the HI cloud, MW-C20. 12CO J=1-0 emission is detected from MW-C21 that is distributed within 11 clumps with most of the CO luminosity coming from a single clump. However, we find no 13CO emission to a 3sigma brightness temperature limit of 0.3 K. Using this limit and RADEX non local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) excitation models, we derive H2 column density upper limits of (0.4-3)x10^{21} cm-2 for a set of physical conditions and a H2 to 12CO abundance ratio of 10^4. Model CO-to-H2 conversion factors are derived for each set of physical conditions. We find the maximum value is 1.6x10^{20} cm-2/(K km/s). Increasing [H2/12CO] to 10^5 to account for photodissociation and cosmic ray ionization increases the column density and XCO upper limits by a factor of 10. Applying these XCO limits to the CO luminosities, the upper limit to the total molecular mass in MW-C21 is 132+/-2~Msun, corresponding to less than 27% of the neutral gas mass. For the three clumps that are fully resolved, lower limits to the virial ratios are 288+/-32, 68+/-28, and 157+/-39, which suggest that these structures are bound by external pressure to remain dynamically stable over the entrainment time of 2x10^6 years or are being disrupted by shear and expansion over the clump crossing times of (3-8)x10^5 years. The observations presented in this study add to the growing census of cold gas entrained within the Galactic Center wind.</description>

      <title>Modeling spatially-resolved galactic H$\alpha$ emission for galaxy clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared spectroscopic surveys target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to probe cosmological scenarios. Understanding the clustering properties of ELGs is essential to derive optimal constraints. We present a simple radiative transfer model for spatially resolved galactic H$\alpha$ emission, which includes emission from the warm-hot diffuse interstellar medium. The atomic level populations are in steady-state and computed in the coronal approximation. The model is applied to multiple IllustrisTNG simulations in the redshift range $1\leq z \leq 2$ to produce the luminosity function (LF) and the halo occupation distribution (HOD). Collisional processes account for a significant fraction of $\approx 40\%$ of the total ${\rm H}\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$). Our LFs are in reasonable agreement with measurements from H$\alpha$ surveys if a uniform extinction of $0.3&lt;A_{{\rm H}\alpha}&lt;0.85$ mag is assumed. Our HOD is consistent with that of the ${\it Euclid}$ Flagship galaxy mock up to differences that can be attributed to baryonic feedback, which is absent from the latter. When H$\alpha$ luminosities are computed from an empirical relation between $L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ and the total star formation rate (SFR) the resulting LFs are in tension with previous observations. Our approach can be extended to other atomic lines, which should be helpful for the mining of high-redshift galaxy spectra in forthcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Particle Flux in a Dynamically Self-consistent Milky Way Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a recently developed dynamically self-consistent model of the Milky Way constrained by observations from the Gaia observatory to include a radially anisotropic component in the dark matter (DM) halo, which represents the debris from the accreted Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) galaxy. In the new model, which we call a self-consistent Anisotropic Halo Model or scAHM, we derive distribution functions for DM velocity in heliocentric and geocentric reference frames. We compare them with the velocity distributions in the standard halo model (SHM) and another anisotropic model (SHM++). We compute predicted scattering rates in direct-detection experiments, for different target nuclei and DM particle masses. Seasonal dependencies of scattering rates are analyzed, revealing small but interesting variations in detection rates for different target nuclei and DM masses. Our findings show that the velocity distribution of the anisotropic GSE component significantly deviates from Gaussian, showing a modest impact on the detection rates. The peculiar kinematic signature of the radially anisotropic component would be most clearly observable by direction-sensitive detectors.</description>

      <title>AstroSat UVIT Survey of M31: New Compact Source Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ultraviolet survey of M31 has been carried out during 2017-23 with the UVIT instrument onboard the AstroSat Observatory. Here we present far and near ultraviolet (FUV and NUV) observations from the M31 UVIT survey, which covers a sky area of $\simeq 3.5^\circ \times 1.3^\circ$ with spatial resolution of $\simeq1^{\prime \prime}$. The observations included six filter bands in the wavelength range of 120 nm to 280 nm. Including the six bands, $\simeq$115,000 sources with signal-to-noise S/N$\ge$3 ( $\simeq$95,000 sources with signal-to-noise S/N$\ge$5) were detected at FUV or NUV wavelengths, with the largest set of detections ($\simeq$54,000 sources) in the FUV 150 nm band (F148W filter). This is considerably more than for the first version of the M31 source catalog (published in 2020), in part due to additional observations of M31 by UVIT and in part due to improved data processing. The magnitude (m$_{AB}$) at which incompleteness sets in is $\simeq$23.0 in the F148W band, with the other bands somewhat less sensitive, with least sensitive band (in m$_{AB}$ units) N279N with incompleteness for sources fainter than $\simeq$20.3). The faintest sources detectable in F148W have m$_{AB}\simeq$25.4, with other bands having higher minimum detectable brightness, with N279N having minimum detectable limit of m$_{AB}\simeq$22.1. The product of this work is the new M31 UVIT compact source catalog, containing positions, fluxes , magnitudes and S/N for the sources.</description>

      <title>Morphological Demographics of Galaxies at $z\sim 10-16$: Log-Normal Size Distribution and Exponential Profiles Consistent with the Disk Formation Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of $169$ galaxies at $z\sim10-16$ with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii $r_{\rm e}$ ranging $20-500$ pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the $r_{\rm e}$ distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of $r_{\rm e}=133^{+13}_{-12}$ pc and a standard deviation of $\sigma_{{\rm ln}r_{\rm e}} = 0.52 \pm 0.08$. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over $z\sim 0-10$. We estimate the virial radius $r_{\rm vir}$ from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio $r_{\rm e}/r_{\rm vir} = 0.015^{+0.015}_{-0.005}$, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-$z$ Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal $r_{\rm e}$ distribution, 2) the standard deviation value, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile ($n=1.3\pm0.6$) suggest that galaxies at $z\sim10-16$ generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of $j_{\rm d} / m_{\rm d} \sim 0.5-1$. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 ($z_{\rm spec}=10.60$) and GHZ2 ($z_{\rm spec}=12.34$) with $r_{\rm e}=55^{+5}_{-6}$ pc and $39\pm11$ pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The Multi-wavelength Extinction Law and its Variation in the Coalsack Molecular Cloud Based on the Gaia, APASS, SMSS, 2MASS, GLIMPSE, and WISE Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of observations relies on the interstellar dust extinction law, which also serves as a powerful diagnostic for probing dust properties. In this study, we investigate the multi-wavelength extinction law of the quiescent, starless molecular cloud Coalsack and explore its potential variation across different interstellar environments: the surrounding region, the nearby high Galactic latitude region, the inner dense region, and the inner diffuse region. Using a sample of 368,524 dwarf stars selected from Gaia DR3 as tracers, we establish the effective temperature Teff-intrinsic color relations to derive the intrinsic color indices and optical-mid-infrared (MIR) color excess (CE) for 20 bands. Linear fits to the CE-CE diagrams provide color excess ratios (CERs), which are subsequently converted into relative extinction. The resulting extinction curves for different environments exhibit steep slopes in the near-infrared (NIR) and flat profiles in the MIR. In the optical-NIR range, the Coalsack extinction law is consistent with R_V = 3.1 while in the MIR it follows R_V= 5.5 similar to the results of active star-forming clouds. At an angular resolution of 1.3', our extinction map reveals fine cloud structures. No correlation is found between R_V and E(B-V) for E(B-V) &gt; 0.3 mag, implying a uniform optical extinction law in the Coalsack cloud. The derived average R_V value is 3.24.</description>

      <title>The [NII] 205 $\mu$m line emission from high-z SMGs and QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present [NII] 205 $\mu$m fine structure line observations of three submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and three quasar host galaxies at 4$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$6 using the Institut de radioastronomie millimetrique (IRAM) interferometer. The [NII] emission is detected in three sources, and we report detections of the underlying dust continuum emission in all sources. The observed [NII]-to-infrared luminosity ratio spans at least 0.5 dex for our sources. Comparing our estimates with sources detected in the [NII] 205 $\mu$m at similar redshifts shows that the overall [NII]-to-IR luminosity ratio spans over a dex in magnitude from L$_{[NII]}$/L$_{IR}$ ~ 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-5}$ and follows the trend of the so-called [NII] fine structure line deficit observed in (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies in the local Universe. The [CII]-to-[NII] luminosity ratio is &gt;10 for most of our sources, indicating that the bulk of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line emission (f([CII]$^{PDR}$)&gt;75%) arises from the neutral medium. From our analysis, we do not find significant differences in the [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission and the respective ratios between SMGs and QSOs, suggesting a negligible contribution to the boosting of [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission due to the active galactic nucleus (AGN) photoionization. Future investigations involving other fine structure lines and optical diagnostics will provide further insight into a suite of ionized medium properties and reveal the diversity between AGN and non-AGN environments.</description>

      <title>Stellar populations from H-band VLT spectroscopy in a sample of seven active galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and its host galaxy is still far from being understood. Properties of the host galaxies of Seyfert nuclei, such as luminosity concentration, morphological type, metallicity, and age of the stellar population are expected to be related with nuclear activity -- either at the epoch of galaxy formation or in the present days via feeding of the central black-hole. In this paper we investigate whether stellar ages and metallicities are linked to the activity within the nucleus in a sample of AGN of various types. Our sample includes seven AGN, from Seyfert 1 to LINERs, observed with VLT/ISAAC and VLT/SINFONI. Based on an inverse method using a stellar library, we analyse H band infrared spectra, in a wavelength region devoid of emission lines, at a spectral resolution of about 3000, in the central few 100 pc. HST images are used to visualise the regions defined in each galaxy. For each galaxy, we give the results of the spectral synthesis, in particular the percentages of the stellar, power law and blackbody continua, and the percentages of various stellar types that account for the stellar lines. Out of the seven galaxies, three show strong and recent star formation in the inner 100 pc, while no star formation is detected in the three genuine Seyfert 2 galaxies. Beyond a radius of 100 pc, all show more or less recent star formation. Moreover we can conclude that the star formation history of the inner nucleus is highly heterogeneous.</description>

      <title>Pulsar scattering as a probe for structures in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the inhomogeneity of electron number density, radio waves emitted by pulsars undergo scattering as they pass through the interstellar medium (ISM). However, a connection between large-scale pulsar scattering data and the structure of the Galactic ISM has yet to be established. In this paper, we explore the capability of pulsar scattering time data in discovering structures in the ISM. Using a large dataset of scattering time measurements for 473 pulsars, we fit the pulsar reduced scattering intensity as a function of Galactic latitude and distance, constructing a smooth model of the Galactic pulsar scattering distribution. By comparing this smooth distribution with observational data, we identify two ISM structures responsible for pulsar scattering, one is associated with the Vela supernova remnant region within the Gum Nebula, while the other is a newly discovered structure -- a distant superbubble, G38, located at a distance of 2.3 kpc with a size of ~50 pc. Analysis of the correlation coefficient of the pulsar scattering distribution shows that the correlation is dominated by structures smaller than 0.15 kpc -- the closest separation approachable by the current dataset. As measurements of the pulsar scattering time continue to increase in the future, they can potentially become an independent tool for exploring structures in the ISM.</description>

      <title>A jet-driven bipolar outflow in NGC 1125</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the role of the feedback from the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the evolution of its host galaxy, we need observational constraints on 100 pc scales. We used the Gemini Near Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph in the J and K bands at a spatial resolution of 100 pc and spectral resolution of 45 km\,s$^{-1}$ to observe the central region of the Seyfert galaxy NGC1125. Emission-line flux distributions in ionized and molecular gas extends up to $\approx$ 300\,pc from the nucleus, where they are found to peak. The Pa$\beta$ and [Fe\,{\sc ii}]$\lambda$1.2570$\mu$m emission-lines show two components: a narrow and a broad. The narrow component is preferably extended from the north-east to the south-west, while the broad component is perpendicular to it. Their kinematics are also different, with the narrow component showing a rotation pattern, with low velocity dispersion values ($\sigma$ $\approx$ 140 km s$^{-1}$) and the broad component a disturbed velocity field and high values of $\sigma$ ($\approx$ 250 km s$^{-1}$). We interpreted the narrow component velocity fields as due to gas rotating in the galaxy plane and fitted rotation velocity models to it, plus an outflow component in the ionized gas. The broad component is interpreted as an outflow, with mass outflow rate in the range of 0.6 to 1.1 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, with an outflow power ranging from 3.9$\times$10$^{40}$ to 1.1$\times$10$^{41}$ erg\,s$^{-1}$, which represents 0.07\% and 0.2\% of the bolometric luminosity of the AGN. There is an explicit relation between the shock ionized outflow and the low-luminosity radio source.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly test or measure weak gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the first-tier prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Predicting the detectability of sulphur-bearing molecules in the solid phase with simulated spectra of JWST instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, gas phase observations of sulphur in dense interstellar environments have only constrained the molecular carriers of 1% of its predicted cosmic abundance. An additional 5% is known to be locked up in molecular solids in dense clouds, leaving the main reservoir of depleted sulphur in the solid phase unknown. The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the JWST could make a substantial difference in detecting part of this missing sulphur, with its wavelength coverage that includes vibrational absorption features of the S-carriers H2S, OCS, SO2, CS2, SO, CS, and S8. The aim of this study is to determine whether these molecules may be viable candidates for detection. We carried out new laboratory measurements of the IR absorption spectra of CS2 and S8 to update the IR band strength of the most intense CS2 absorption feature at 6.8 {\mu}m, as well as to determine that of S8 at 20.3 {\mu}m for the first time. These data, along with values previously reported in the literature, allow us to evaluate which S-bearing species could be potentially detected with JWST in interstellar ices. Taking the literature abundances of the major ice species determined by previous IR observations towards starless cores, LYSOs and MYSOs, we generated simulated IR spectra using the characteristics of the instruments on the JWST. Thus, we have been able to establish a case study for three stages of the star formation process. We conclude that the detection of S-bearing molecules remains challenging. Despite these obstacles, the detection of H2S and potentially SO2 should be possible in regions with favourable physical and chemical conditions. In contrast, S8 would remain undetected. Although the sensitivity of JWST is insufficient to determine the sulphur budget in the solid state, the detection of an additional icy sulphur compound (H2S, SO2) would enable us to elevate our knowledge of sulphur chemistry.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XVII - Census and lifetime of high-mass prestellar cores in 14 massive protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mass prestellar cores are extremely rare. The search for such objects has long been hindered by small sample sizes, leading to large uncertainties in their lifetimes and the conditions in which high-mass stars ($&gt; 8\,M_{\odot}$) form. We leverage the large sample ($\sim 580$ cores) detected in the ALMA-IMF survey to identify both protostellar and prestellar cores and estimate their relative lifetimes. We use CO and SiO outflows to identify protostellar cores and introduce a new automated method based on aperture line emission and background subtraction to systematically detect outflows associated with each of the 141 most massive cores. Massive cores that do not drive an outflow in either tracer are classified as prestellar. Our method enables efficient outflow detection with performance comparable to more traditional techniques. We identify 30 likely prestellar cores with $M &gt; 8\,M_{\odot}$, including 12 with $M &gt; 16\,M_{\odot}$, the best candidates for high-mass star precursors. Most of these 12 cores reside in the crowded central regions of protoclusters, where high-mass stars are expected to form. Using prestellar-to-protostellar core ratios and a 300 kyr protostellar lifetime, we estimate prestellar lifetimes of 120 to 240 kyr for $8\,M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 16\,M_{\odot}$ and 50 to 100 kyr for $30\,M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 55\,M_{\odot}$. These timescales, which depend on different mass reservoir evolution scenarios, significantly exceed the 4 to 15 kyr free-fall time of the cores, suggesting that high-mass cores persist for 10 to 30 free-fall times. This indicates that collapse is slowed by turbulence, magnetic fields, or rotation at or below the observed scale.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength investigations of PKS 2300-18: S-shaped radio quasar with precessing jets and double-peaked broad emission-line spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S-shaped radio galaxy jets are prime sources for investigating the dynamic interplay between the central active galactic nucleus, the jets, and the ambient intergalactic medium. These sources are excellent candidates for studying jet precession, as their S-shaped inversion symmetry strongly indicates underlying precession. We present a multiwavelength analysis of the giant inversion-symmetric S-shaped radio galaxy PKS 2300-18, which spans 0.76 Mpc. The host is a quasar at a redshift of 0.128, displaying disturbed optical morphology due to an ongoing merger with a companion galaxy. We conducted a broadband radio spectral study using multifrequency data ranging from 183 MHz to 6 GHz, incorporating dedicated observations with the uGMRT and JVLA alongside archival radio data. A particle injection model was fitted to the spectra of different regions of the source to perform ageing analysis, which was supplemented with a kinematic jet precession model. The ageing analysis revealed a maximum plasma age of ~ 40 Myr, while the jet precession model indicated a precession period of ~ 12 Myr. ROSAT data revealed an X-ray halo of Mpc size, and from Chandra the AGN X-ray spectrum was modelled using thermal and power-law components. The optical spectrum displaying double-peaked broad emission lines was modelled, indicating complex broad-line region kinematics at the centre with the possibility of a binary SMBH. We present the results of our multiwavelength analysis of the source, spanning scales from a few light-days to a few Mpc, and discuss its potential evolutionary path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a poster presentation for IAU Symposium 392: "Neutral hydrogen in and around galaxies in the SKA era", we gave an overview of the HI-MaNGA project which is working to obtain complementary information about the cold gas (neutral hydrogen traced by the radio 21cm line) content of Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) sample galaxies. MaNGA, part of the fourth incarnation of the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys (SDSS-IV), obtained spatially resolved spectral maps for 10,000 nearby galaxies selected to create a representative sample out of the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. MaNGA data have provided a census of the stellar and ionized gas content of these galaxies, as well as kinematics of both stars and gas. Adding HI information via the HI-MaNGA program, which has observed or collected 21cm line data for 70% of the full MaNGA sample, has been crucial for a number of applications, but especially understanding the physical mechanisms that regulate gas accretion, and through that star formation and quenching of star formation. This conference proceedings article accompanies the release of the DR3 version of HI-MaNGA data.</description>

      <title>Morphological Classification of Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphological classification of galaxies provides vital physical information about the orbital motions of stars in galaxies, and correlates in interesting ways with star formation history, and other physical properties. Galaxy morphological classification is a field with a history of more than 100 years of development, and many scientists have introduced new classification schemes, resulting in a sometimes confusing array of terminologies and overlapping classes. In this article I provide a brief historical review of galaxy classification, but focus mostly on providing a summary of how the morphological variety of galaxies seen in our expanding Universe are described. I review traditional visual classification, morphometric measurements, crowd-sourcing for large scale visual classifications (Galaxy Zoo), and of course the recent explosion of interest in making use of machine learning techniques for galaxy morphology classification. A look up table is provided for cross matching of various terminologies currently in use for galaxy morphology classification as well as brief definitions of the main morphological types.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of axion dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a 'gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a generic quantum state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the axion particles comprising the solitonic core; for plausible parameter values, such a core is found to be in tension with the existence of the clockwise stellar disc at $2\sigma$ for $4.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.3\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.</description>

      <title>The Bulk Motion of Gas in the Core of the Centaurus Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe, contain vast amounts of dark matter, galaxies, and hot ionised gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the ICM appears to cool radiatively faster than the age of the cluster, but the absence of line emission from the predicted cooling rate suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (``sloshing'') motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for the distribution of heat from the outside of the core. Here we present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of the core of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the XRISM satellite. We find that the hot gas is streaming along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy (NGC 4696), with relative velocities varying from 130 km/s to 310 km/s within ~ 30 kpc of the centre, indicating a structured bulk flow ("wind") blowing in the core. This wind is consistent with the core gas sloshing. While the wind may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre of the cluster, it could also distribute the heat injected by the central AGN and/or bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM, thus contributing to the thermal balance at the cluster centre. The velocity dispersion (turbulent velocity) of the gas is found to be only ~&lt; 120 km/s (corresponding to a Mach number M ~&lt; 0.2) in the core, even within ~ 10 kpc of the AGN. This may indicate that the influence of the AGN on the motion of the surrounding ICM is limited in the Centaurus cluster.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect with ACT and DESI Luminous Red Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scatter off the free-electron gas in galaxies and clusters, allowing us to use the CMB as a backlight to probe the gas in and around low-redshift galaxies. The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, sourced by hot electrons in high-density environments, measures the thermal pressure of the target objects, shedding light on halo thermodynamics and galaxy formation and providing a path toward understanding the baryon distribution around cosmic structures. We use a combination of high-resolution CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and photometric luminous red galaxy (LRG) catalogues from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to measure the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal in four redshift bins from $z=0.4$ to $z=1.2$, with a combined detection significance of 19$\sigma$ when stacking on the fiducial CMB Compton-$y$ map. We discuss possible sources of contamination, finding that residual dust emission associated with the target galaxies is important and limits current analyses. We discuss several mitigation strategies and quantify the residual modelling uncertainty. This work complements closely-related measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and weak lensing of the same galaxies.</description>

      <title>Density fluctuation-Mach number scaling in compressible, high plasma beta turbulence: in-situ space observations and high-Reynolds number simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of compressible fluctuations in a broad range of turbulent plasmas, from the intracluster medium to the solar wind, has been an active field of research in the past decades. Theoretical frameworks for weakly compressible MHD turbulence in an inhomogeneous background magnetic field predict a linear scaling of the normalized mass density fluctuation ($\delta \rho / \rho_0$), as a function of the turbulent Mach number ($\mathcal{M}_t$), $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$. However, so far the scaling relation has been tested only using moderate to low plasma beta ($\beta \lesssim 1$) solar wind observational data where the compressibility is weak $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \sim 0.1$. Here, we combine NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission data in Earth's magnetosheath, where $\beta \sim 10$ is high, and $\beta \sim 1$ highly-compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations at unprecedented resolutions. Both show that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ holds across a broad range of $\delta \rho / \rho_0$, $\mathcal{M}_t$ and $\beta$, demonstrating that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ is a robust compressible turbulence relation, going beyond the asymptotics of the weakly compressible theory. We discuss the findings in the context of understanding the nature of strongly compressible turbulent fluctuations and the driving parameter in astrophysical and space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Deep Optical Images of the Ejecta Nebula Around the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 8 (HD 62910)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of deep H-alpha and [O III] images of the bright WN7/WC4 Wolf-Rayet star WR 8 (HD 62910). These data show considerably more surrounding nebulosity than seen in prior imaging. The brighter portions of the nebula span 6' in diameter and exhibit considerable fine-scale structure including numerous emission clumps and bright head-tail like features presumably due to the effects of the WR star's stellar winds. Due to the overlap of a relatively bright band of unrelated foreground diffuse interstellar H-alpha emission, WR 8's nebula is best viewed via its [O III] emission. A faint 9' x 13' diffuse outer nebulosity is detected surrounding the nebula's main ring of emission. The nebula's optical structure is substantially different from that of its thermal continuum dust emission seen in WISE 22 micron infrared images which show a smaller and sharply defined emission shell.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic modelling of Pop. III star formation and metallicity evolution - II. Impact on 21cm power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating Population (Pop.) III star formation in mini-halos in a large cosmological simulation is an extremely challenging task but it is crucial to estimate its impact on the 21cm power spectrum. In this work, we develop a framework within the semi-analytical code meraxes to estimate the radiative backgrounds from Pop. III stars needed for the computation of the 21cm signal. We computed the 21cm global signal and power spectrum for different Pop. III models varying star formation efficiency, initial mass function (IMF) and specific X-ray luminosity per unit of star formation (LX/SFR). In all the models considered, we find Pop. III stars have little to no impact on the reionization history but significantly affect the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) due to the strong injection of X-ray photons from their remnants that heat the neutral IGM at $z \geq$ 15. This is reflected not only on the 21cm sky-averaged global signal during the Cosmic Dawn but also on the 21cm power spectrum at $z \leq$ 10 where models with strong Pop. III X-ray emission have larger power than models with no or mild Pop. III X-ray emission. We estimate observational uncertainties on the power spectrum using 21cmsense and find that models where Pop. III stars have a stronger X-ray emission than Pop. II are distinguishable from models with no or mild Pop. III X-ray emission with 1000 hours observations of the upcoming SKA1-low.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic galaxy alignments in the KiDS-1000 bright sample: dependence on colour, luminosity, morphology and galaxy scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is a major astrophysical contaminant to weak gravitational lensing measurements, and the study of its dependence on galaxy properties helps provide meaningful physical priors that aid cosmological analyses. This work studies for the first time the dependence of intrinsic alignments on galaxy structural parameters. We measure the intrinsic alignments of bright galaxies, selected on $r$-band magnitude $r&lt;20$, in the Kilo-Degree Survey. Machine-learning-based photometric redshift estimates are available for this galaxy sample that help obtain a clean measurement of its intrinsic alignment signal. We supplement this sample with a catalogue of structural parameters from S\'ersic profile fits to the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies. We split the sample in galaxy intrinsic colour, luminosity and S\'ersic index, and we fit the non-linear linear alignment model to galaxy position - shape projected correlation function measurements at large scales. We observe a power-law luminosity dependence of the large-scale intrinsic alignment amplitude, $A_\mathrm{IA}$, for both the red and high S\'ersic index ($n_s&gt;2.5$) samples, and find no significant difference between the two samples. We measure a $\sim1.5\sigma$ lower $A_\mathrm{IA}$ for red galaxies that also have a S\'ersic index $n_s&lt;4$, compared to the expected amplitude predicted using sample's luminosity. We also probe the intrinsic alignment of red galaxies as a function of galaxy scale by varying the radial weight employed in the shape measurement. We find no significant difference on large scales but on small scales, alignments increase with galaxy scale. For intrinsically blue galaxies, we find $A_\mathrm{IA}=-0.67\pm1.00$, consistent with previous works. We also find alignments to be consistent with zero for the low S\'ersic index ($n_s&lt;2.5$) sample.</description>

      <title>Rosette Nebula Outburst Gaia 24djk from the Young Stellar Object V557 Mon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A previously faint young stellar object (YSO), V557 Mon, rapidly brightened in late 2024 and is currently at least $\Delta G=3.3$ magnitudes brighter than its typical pre-outburst brightness. The ongoing outburst is identified in the Gaia Alerts system as Gaia24djk. We obtained a 1-2.5 $\mu$m spectrum of the object and find the spectrum is dominated by line emission and continuum excess consistent with rapid YSO accretion, similar to the star EX Lup during its outburst state. We speculate that the burst, which has not yet reached its peak brightness, may become an FU Ori outburst, which would be evidenced by the emission spectrum turning into an absorption spectrum.</description>

      <title>Comparison of methods used to derive the Galactic star formation history from white dwarf samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare three methods of deriving the local Galactic star formation history, using as a benchmark the Gaia-defined 40 pc white dwarf sample, currently the largest volume complete sample of stellar remnants with medium-resolution spectroscopy. We create a population synthesis model to 1) reproduce the observed white dwarf luminosity function, 2) reproduce the observed absolute Gaia G magnitude distribution, and 3) directly calculate the ages of all individual white dwarfs in the 40 pc volume. We then compare the star formation histories determined from each method. Previous studies using these methods were based on different white dwarf samples and as such were difficult to compare. Uncertainties in each method such as the initial mass function, initial-final mass relation, main sequence lifetimes, stellar metallicity, white dwarf cooling ages and binary evolution are accounted for to estimate the precision and accuracy of each method. We conclude that no method is quantitatively better at determining the star formation history and all three produce star formation histories that agree within uncertainties of current external astrophysical relations.</description>

      <title>Star-crossed Clusters: Asteroseismic Ages for Individual Stars are in Tension with the Ages of their Host Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A meta-analysis of seismic ages determined for individual stars in the well-studied open and globular clusters NGC 6819, NGC 6791, M67, M4, M19, M80, and M9 reveals both high variance across measurements and significant discrepancy with independent, isochrone-based age determinations for the clusters in which these stars reside. The scatter among asteroseismic ages for individual stars in any one of these clusters far surpasses both the absolute age uncertainty computed for reference cluster M92 (5.4\%) and the model-to-model systematic uncertainties in isochrones (roughly 10\%). This suggests that either binary processes are significantly altering the masses of stars in these clusters, or some additional corrections, perhaps as a function of mass, metallicity, or surface gravity, are required to bring the asteroseismic age scale into concordance with ages inferred from isochrone or similar model fitting.</description>

      <title>The role of triple evolution in the formation of LISA double white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs will be prominent gravitational-wave sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). While previous studies have primarily focused on formation scenarios in which binaries form and evolve in isolation, we present the first detailed study of the role of triple stellar evolution in forming the population of LISA double white dwarfs. In this work, we present the first detailed study of the role of triple stellar evolution in forming the population of LISA double white dwarfs. We use the multiple stellar evolution code (MSE) to model the stellar evolution, binary interactions, and the dynamics of triple star systems then use a Milky Way-like galaxy from the TNG50 simulations to construct a representative sample of LISA double white dwarfs. In our simulations about $7\times10^6$ Galactic double white dwarfs in the LISA frequency bandwidth originate from triple systems, whereas $\sim4\times10^6$ form from isolated binary stars. The properties of double white dwarfs formed in triples closely resemble those formed from isolated binaries, but we also find a small number of systems $\sim\mathcal{O}(10)$ that reach extreme eccentricities $(&gt;0.9)$, a feature unique to the dynamical formation channels. Our population produces $\approx 10^{4} $ individually resolved double white dwarfs (from triple and binary channels) and an unresolved stochastic foreground below the level of the LISA instrumental noise. About $57\,\%$ of double white dwarfs from triple systems retain a bound third star when entering the LISA frequency bandwidth. However, we expect the tertiary stars to be too distant to have a detectable imprint in the gravitational-wave signal of the inner binary.</description>

      <title>Like a candle in the wind: The embers of once aflame, now smouldering galaxies at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a photometric search method for identifying smouldering galaxies at $5&lt; z &lt; 8$, which are defined to have weak emission lines and thus generally have low specific star formation rates and may even be in a state of (temporary) quiescence. The deep NIRCam imaging (${\sim}29.5$ AB mag, 5$\sigma$) from the JADES second data release is essential for finding these systems, as they are faint, relatively quiescent dwarf galaxies ($M_* \sim 10^{8}$-$10^9$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot)$ in the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). Moreover, medium-band imaging is key, enabling a clear identification of the lack of emission lines in these galaxies, thus betraying their dormant flame. Owing to the young age of the Universe, combined with the likely bursty star formation in these first dwarf galaxies, conventional colour-selection methods like the UVJ diagram likely miss a large fraction of the quiescent population in the EoR. Indeed, we find that smouldering galaxies constitute a considerable fraction (0.05-0.35) of the EoR dwarf galaxy population ($M_* \sim 10^{8}$-$10^{9}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$). As predicted by simulations, these first dwarf galaxies are fragile, the star formation in their shallow potential wells easily snuffed out by feedback-driven winds triggered by secular or merger-driven starbursts, with the smouldering fraction increasing with decreasing stellar mass. Finally, we provide observational constraints on the smouldering galaxy comoving number density (${\sim}10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}$ dex$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$), which, although hampered by incompleteness, should aid in our understanding of the primordial baryon cycle, as current simulations greatly disagree on whether these systems are rare (${\sim}1\%$) or common (${\sim}50\%$) in the EoR.</description>

      <title>Distribution functions for the modelling of accretion remnants in Milky Way-like galaxies: insights from IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study accretion remnants around Milky Way analogs in the IllustrisTNG simulations to determine how well commonly used distribution functions (DFs) describe their phase-space distributions. We identify 30 Milky Way analogs and 116 remnants from mergers with stellar mass ratios greater than 1:20. Two-power density profiles, as well as rotating constant-anisotropy and Osipkov-Merritt DFs are fit to the remnants. We determine that the remnants are suitable for equilibrium modelling by assessing them in the context of the Jeans equation. Each of the models we consider are reasonably able to fit the stellar remnant energy and angular momentum distribution, as well as the magnitude and shape of velocity dispersion profiles. Case studies matched to two well-known merger remnants in the stellar halo-Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GS/E) and Sequoia-are explored in more depth. We find good evidence that remnants with high anisotropy $\beta$, such as GS/E, are better modelled with a superposition of two Osipkov-Merritt DFs than either a constant-anisotropy model or a single Osipkov-Merritt DF. We estimate an Osipkov-Merritt profile with scale radius between 2-4 kpc would be a good first-order representation of GS/E, and comment on existing observational evidence for this as well as studies which could demonstrate it. Overall, we find that DF-based models work well for describing the kinematics of large merger remnants. Our results will be an important reference for future studies which seek to constrain both the spatial and kinematic properties of merger remnants in the Milky Way stellar halo.</description>

      <title>The properties of magnetised cold filaments in a cool-core galaxy cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filaments of cold gas ($T\leq 10^{4}$ K) are found in the inner regions of many cool-core clusters. These structures are thought to play a major role in the regulation of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We study the morphology of the filaments, their formation, and their impact on the propagation of the outflowing AGN jets. We present a set of GPU-accelerated 3D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster using the performance portable code AthenaPK. We include radiative cooling, and a self-regulated AGN feedback model that redistributes accreted material through kinetic, thermal and magnetic feedback. We confirm that magnetic fields play an important role in both the formation and evolution of the cold material. These suppress the formation of massive cold discs and favour magnetically supported filaments over clumpy structures. Achieving resolutions of $25-50$ pc, we find that filaments are not monolithic as they contain numerous and complex magnetically supported sub-structures. We find that the mass distribution of these clumps follows a $\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}M \propto M^{-1.6}$ power-law for all investigated filaments. Studying the evolution of individual filaments, we find that their formation pathways can be diverse. We find examples of filaments forming through a combination of gas uplifting and condensation, as well as systems of purely infalling clumps condensing out of the intracluster medium. The density contrast between the cold gas and the outflowing hot material leads to recurring deflections of the jets, favouring inflation of bubbles.</description>

      <title>The UNCOVER Survey: First Release of Ultradeep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra for ~700 galaxies from z~0.3-13 in Abell 2744</title>

Abstract: We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization ($z\sim6-8$), high redshift AGN ($z\gtrsim6$), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies ($1\lesssim{}z\lesssim 6$), and filler galaxies sampling redshift--color--magnitude space from z~0.1-13. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin$^2$, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to $m_{\mathrm{F444W}}\sim30\mathrm{AB}$, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of $M_{\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\pm0.3)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).</description>

      <title>Witnessing the onset of reionisation via Lyman-$\alpha$ emission at redshift 13</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Cosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift $z = 14$, when the Universe was less than $300 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift $z = 13.0$ that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly$\alpha$, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of $\text{EW}_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} &gt; 40 \, \AA$ (rest frame), previously only seen at $z &lt; 9$ where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly$\alpha$ emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly$\alpha$, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only $330 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Initial Mass Function of Early Dark Matter-free Gas Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the remarkable strides made by JWST is the discovery of the earliest star clusters found to date. These have been proposed as early progenitors of globular clusters, which are known to come from the early stages of star formation in the Universe. This is an exciting development in modern astronomy, as it offers an opportunity to connect theoretical models of globular cluster formation to actual observations of these high-redshift structures. In this work, we aim to develop observational signatures of a star cluster formation route known as supersonically induced gas objects, which are dark matter-less gas clouds in the early Universe proposed as a potential origin of some globular clusters. For the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of binary black holes in $N$-body simulations of star clusters with up to two million stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding binary black hole (BBH) dynamics in dense star clusters is key to interpreting the gravitational wave detections by LIGO and Virgo. Here, we perform $N$-body simulations of star clusters, focusing on BBH formation mechanisms, dynamical evolution and merging properties. We explore a wide parameter space of initial conditions, with cluster masses ranging from $10^{4}$ to $10^{6}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, densities from $10^{3}$ to $10^{5}~\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-3}$, and up to $100\%$ of massive stars in binaries. We show that most BBH mergers originate from the primordial binary population rather than being dynamically assembled, and that the evolution towards merger for most of these binaries is not significantly altered by dynamical encounters. As a result, the overall number of BBH mergers from the $N$-body simulations is nearly identical to that obtained when the same stellar population is evolved in isolation. Contrary to theoretical expectations, nearly all dynamically formed BBH mergers occur when the binary is still bound to its host cluster, with $\simeq 90\%$ of all dynamical mergers occurring within the cluster core region. In about half of these mergers the binary is part of a stable black hole-triple system. In one model, stellar mergers lead to the formation of a $\simeq 200\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ black hole, which then grows to $\simeq 300\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ through black hole mergers. Our study highlights the importance of detailed $N$-body simulations in capturing the evolution of black hole populations in dense clusters and challenges conclusions based on semi-analytical and Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Measuring the ISM Content of Nearby, Luminous, Type 1 and Type 2 QSOs through CO and [C II]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of CO(1--0) and CO(2--1) lines from the Institut de radioastronomie millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30m telescope toward 20 nearby, optically luminous type 2 quasars (QSO2s) and observations of [C II] 158$\mu$m line from the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) for 5 QSO2s in the CO sample and 5 type 1 quasars (QSO1s). In the traditional evolutionary scenario explaining different types of QSOs, obscured QSO2s emerge from gas-rich mergers observed as luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and then turn into unobscured QSO1s as the black holes clear out the obscuring material in a blow-out phase. We test the validity of this theoretical prediction by comparing the gas fractions and star formation efficiencies among LIRGs and QSOs. We find that CO luminosity, CO-derived gas masses and gas fractions in QSO1s are consistent with those estimated for QSO2s, while LIRGs exhibit a closer resemblance to QSO2s in terms of CO-derived gas masses and gas fractions. Comparisons between [C II] luminosity and star formation tracers such as the CO and infrared luminosity imply additional sources of [C II] emission in QSO1s likely tracing neutral atomic or ionized gas with the caveat of a small sample size. All three types of galaxies have statistically indistinguishable distributions of star formation efficiency. Our results are consistent with part of the evolutionary scenario where nearby QSO2s could emerge from LIRGs, but they may not be the precursors of nearby QSO1s.</description>

      <title>Core to Cosmic Edge: SIMBA-C's New Take on Abundance Profiles in the Intragroup Medium at z = 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the SIMBA-C cosmological simulation to study the impact of its upgraded chemical enrichment model (Chem5) on the distribution of metals in the intragroup medium (IGrM). We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted abundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \leq M_{500}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates lower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better agreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich the IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely related to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D mass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM abundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by reduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling of metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass in low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and stellar feedback models. Our study suggests that a more realistic chemical enrichment model broadly improves agreement with observations, but physically motivated sub-grid models for other key processes, like AGN and stellar feedback and turbulent diffusion, are required to realistically reproduce observed group environments.</description>

      <title>Investigating photometric and spectroscopic variability in the multiply-imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is a unique test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the $z=7.045$ multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to $18\pm3$ % for H$\alpha$ and up to $22\pm8$ % in H$\beta$, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}=4\times10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Models of the Milky Way in Action Space with LAMOST DR8 and GAIA EDR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores dynamical models of the Milky Way (MW) by analyzing a sample of 86,109 K giant stars selected through cross-matching the LAMOST DR8 and Gaia EDR3 surveys. Our earlier torus models in Wang et al. (2017) did not include Gaia data, making them incompatible with the new proper motion distributions of samples. Here, we refine the construction of action-based, self-consistent models to constrain the three-dimensional velocity distribution of K giants over a larger parameter space, drawing on a series of existing MW models. This approach produces several new MW models. Our best-fit model for the local kinematics near the Sun indicates a MW virial mass of 1.35 $\times 10^{12} M_\odot$, a local stellar density of 0.0696 $\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}$, and a local dark matter density of 0.0115 $\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}$. Our main conclusion supports a thicker and more extended thick disk, alongside a cooler thin disk, compared to the best-fitting model in Wang et al. (2017). Near the Sun, our model aligns well with observations, but is less satisfactory at distances far from the Galactic center, perhaps implying unidentified structures. Further high-precision observations will be critical for understanding the dynamics in these outer Galactic regions, and will require a more realistic model.</description>

Abstract: The identity of dark matter has been a mystery in astronomy, cosmology, and particle theory for about a century. Bessho, Ikeda, and Yin (2022), three of the current authors, proposed using the state-of-the-art infrared spectrographs, including WINERED at $6.5$m Magellan Clay telescope and NIRSpec at James Webb Space Telescope, as efficient detectors for the indirect detection of dark matter with the mass around eV by measuring the line photons from the dark matter two body decays. Applying this concept, we have performed spectrographic observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Leo V and Tucana II using WINERED by utilizing an object-sky-object nodding observation technique for background subtraction. We present the first result from this dark matter search. Employing zero consistent flux data after the sky subtraction, we have established one of the most stringent limits to date on dark matter decaying into line photons in the mass range of $1.8-2.7\,$eV. Our data can also be applied to constrain other spectra of photons from the dSphs.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution and mass distribution of the Galactic Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have the total masses distributing narrowly around $\sim2.6-2.7M_\odot$, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass ($\sim3.4M_\odot$). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetime than the low-mass BNSs, and thus smaller probability being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of spin period versus spin-period-time-derivative ($P-\dot{P}$) and orbital period versus eccentricity ($P_{\rm orb}-e$) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction ($\sim19\%-22\%$) of merging BNSs at redshift $z\sim0$ have masses $\gtrsim3M_\odot$, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraint on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.</description>

Abstract: Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.32^{+0.29}_{-0.25}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.62^{+0.15}_{-0.07}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within &lt;500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}&lt;1.43$ and $M_{SW}&lt;1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($&gt;r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.</description>
