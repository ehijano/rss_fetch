      <title>The Chow ring of the universal Picard stack over the hyperelliptic locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{J}^d_g \to \mathscr{M}_g$ be the universal Picard stack parametrizing degree $d$ line bundles on genus $g$ curves, and let $\mathscr{J}^d_{2,g}$ be its restriction to locus of hyperelliptic curves $\mathscr{H}_{2,g} \subset \mathscr{M}_g$. We determine the rational Chow ring of $\mathscr{J}^d_{2,g}$ for all $d$ and $g$. In particular, we prove it is generated by restrictions of tautological classes on $\mathscr{J}^d_g$ and we determine all relations among the restrictions of such classes. We also compute the integral Picard group of $\mathscr{J}^d_{2,g}$, completing (and extending to the $\mathrm{PGL}_2$-equivariant case) prior work of Erman and Wood. As a corollary, we prove that $\mathscr{J}^d_{2,g}$ is either a trivial $\mathbb{G}_m$-gerbe over its rigidification, or has Brauer class of order $2$, depending on the parity of $d - g$.</description>

      <title>Virasoro constraints for K3 surfaces and monodromy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virasoro constraints for moduli spaces of stable torsion free sheaves on a surface with only $(p,p)$-cohomology were recently proved by Bojko-Moreira-Lim. The rank 1 case, which is not restricted to surfaces with only $(p,p)$-cohomology, was established by Moreira. We formulate conjectural Virasoro constraints in any positive rank without requiring only $(p,p)$-cohomology. We prove our conjecture for K3 surfaces using Markman monodromy operators, which allow us to reduce to the rank 1 case. We also prove new Virasoro constraints in rank 0. Finally, for K3 surfaces, we introduce new Virasoro operators in negative degree which, together with the previous Virasoro operators, give a representation of Virasoro algebra with central charge $24$.</description>

      <title>A Semi-orthogonal Sequence in the Derived Category of the Hilbert Scheme of Three Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $d \geq 5$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero, it is shown in this paper that the bounded derived category of the Hilbert scheme of three points $X^{[3]}$ admits a semi-orthogonal sequence of length $\binom{d-3}{2}$. Each subcategory in this sequence is equivalent to the derived category of $X$ and realized as the image of a Fourier-Mukai transform along a Grassmannian bundle $\mathbb{G}$ over $X$ parametrizing planar subschemes in $X^{[3]}$. The main ingredient in the proof is the computation of the normal bundle of $\mathbb{G}$ in $X^{[3]}$. An analogous result for generalized Kummer varieties is deduced at the end.</description>

      <title>Torsors on moduli spaces of principal $G$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple complex algebraic group with a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and let $\mathcal{M}^0_{G}$ denote the moduli stack of topologically trivial stable $G$-bundles on a smooth projective curve $C$. Fix a theta characteristic $\kappa$ on $C$ which is even in case $\dim{\mathfrak{g}}$ is odd. We show that there is a nonempty Zariski open substack ${\mathcal U}_\kappa$ of $\mathcal{M}^0_{G}$ such that $H^i(C,\, \text{ad}(E_G)\otimes\kappa) \,=\, 0$, $i\,=\, 1,\, 2$, for all $E_G\,\in\, {\mathcal U}_\kappa$. It is shown that any such $E_G$ has a canonical connection. It is also shown that the tangent bundle $T{U}_\kappa$ has a natural splitting, where $U_{\kappa}$ is the restriction of $\mathcal{U}_{\kappa}$ to the semi-stable locus. We also produce an isomorphism between two naturally occurring $\Omega^1_{{M}^{rs}_{G}}$--torsors on the moduli space of regularly stable ${M}^{rs}_{G}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of holomorphic vector bundles $E$ over a Riemann surface $C$ together with a section of the endomorphism bundle tensored with $K^{1/2}$ -- a square root of the canonical bundle $K$. These parallel to some extent the various features of usual Higgs bundles, such as spectral curve constructions, but some features are radically different. We make essential use of the mod 2 index to distinguish two families of moduli spaces, and provide examples in low genus.</description>

      <title>Exact Flux Vacua, Symmetries, and the Structure of the Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying flux vacua in string theory with stabilized complex structure moduli presents a significant challenge, necessitating the minimization of a scalar potential complicated by infinitely many exponential corrections. In order to obtain exact results we connect three central topics: transcendentality or algebraicity of coupling functions, emergent symmetries, and the distribution of vacua. Beginning with explicit examples, we determine the first exact landscape of flux vacua with a vanishing superpotential within F-theory compactifications on a genuine Calabi-Yau fourfold. We find that along certain symmetry loci in moduli space the generically transcendental vacuum conditions become algebraic and can be described using the periods of a K3 surface. On such loci the vacua become dense when we do not bound the flux tadpole, while imposing the tadpole bound yields a small finite landscape of distinct vacua. Away from these symmetry loci, the transcendentality of the fourfold periods ensures that there are only a finite number of vacua with a vanishing superpotential, even when the tadpole constraint is removed. These observations exemplify the general patterns emerging in the bulk of moduli space that we expose in this work. They are deeply tied to the arithmetic structure underlying flux vacua and generalize the finiteness claims about rational CFTs and rank-two attractors. From a mathematical perspective, our study is linked with the recent landmark results by Baldi, Klingler, and Ullmo about the Hodge locus that arose from connecting tame geometry and Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Atypical values at infinity of real polynomial maps with $2$-dimensional fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize atypical values at infinity of a real polynomial function of three variables by a certain sum of indices of the gradient vector field of the function restricted to a sphere with a sufficiently large radius. This is an analogy of a result of Coste and de la Puente for real polynomial functions with two variables. We also give a characterization of atypical values at infinity of a real polynomial map whose regular fibers are $2$-dimensional surfaces.</description>

      <title>Schubert puzzles and integrability II: multiplying motivic Segre classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.00563v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Schubert Puzzles and Integrability I we proved several "puzzle rules" for computing products of Schubert classes in K-theory (and sometimes equivariant K-theory) of d-step flag varieties. The principal tool was "quantum integrability", in several variants of the Yang--Baxter equation; this let us recognize the Schubert structure constants as q-&gt;0 limits of certain matrix entries in products of R- (and other) matrices of quantized affine algebra representations. In the present work we give direct cohomological interpretations of those same matrix entries but at finite q: they compute products of "motivic Segre classes", closely related to K-theoretic Maulik--Okounkov stable classes living on the cotangent bundles of the flag varieties. Without q-&gt;0, we avoid some divergences that blocked fuller understanding of d=3,4. The puzzle computations are then explained (in cohomology onlyin this work, not K-theory) in terms of Lagrangian convolutions between Nakajima quiver varieties. More specifically, the conormal bundle to the diagonal inclusion of a flag variety factors through a quiver variety that is not a cotangent bundle, and it is on that intermediate quiver variety that the R-matrix calculation occurs.</description>

      <title>Forms on Berkovich spaces based on harmonic tropicalizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce tropical skeletons for Berkovich spaces based on results of Ducros. Then we study harmonic functions on good strictly analytic spaces over a non-trivially valued non-Archimedean field. Chambert-Loir and Ducros introduced bigraded sheaves of smooth real-valued differential forms on Berkovich spaces by pulling back Lagerberg forms with respect to tropicalization maps. We give a new approach in which we allow pullback by more general harmonic tropicalizations to get a larger sheaf of differential forms with essentially the same properties, but with a better cohomological behavior. A crucial ingredient is that tropical varieties arising from harmonic tropicalization maps are balanced.</description>

      <title>Dimension two holomorphic distributions on four-dimensional projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional holomorphic distributions on $\mathbb{P}^4$. We classify dimension two distributions, of degree at most $2$, with either locally free tangent sheaf or locally free conormal sheaf and whose singular scheme has pure dimension one. We show that the corresponding sheaves are split. Next, we investigate the geometry of such distributions, studying from maximally non-integrable to integrable distributions. In the maximally non-integrable case, we show that the distribution is either of Lorentzian type or a push-forward by a rational map of the Cartan prolongation of a singular contact structure on a weighted projective 3-fold. We study distributions of dimension two in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose the conormal sheaves are the Horrocks-Mumford sheaves, describing the numerical invariants of their singular schemes which are smooth and connected. Such distributions are maximally non-integrable, uniquely determined by their singular schemes and invariant by a group $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5) \subset Sp(4, \mathbb{Q})$, where $H_5$ is the Heisenberg group of level $5$. We prove that the moduli spaces of Horrocks-Mumford distributions are irreducible quasi-projective varieties and we determine their dimensions. Finally, we observe that the space of codimension one distributions, of degree $d\geq 6$, on $\mathbb{P}^4$ have a family of degenerated flat holomorphic Riemannian metrics. Moreover, the degeneracy divisors of such metrics consist of codimension one distributions invariant by $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5)$ and singular along a degenerate abelian surface with $(1,5)$-polarization and level-$5$-structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13247v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between essential divisors and F-blowups, in particular, address the problem whether all essential divisors appear on the $e$-th F-blowup for large enough $e$. Focusing on the case of normal affine toric varieties, we establish a simple sufficient condition for a divisor over the given toric variety to appear on the normalized limit F-blowup as a prime divisor. As a corollary, we show that if a normal toric variety has a crepant resolution, then the above problem has a positive answer, provided that we use the notion of essential divisors in the sense of Bouvier and Gonzalez-Sprinberg. We also provide an example of toric threefold singularities for which a non-essential divisor appears on an F-blowup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an analog of the wall crossing formula for Welschinger invariants relating the difference of signed curve counting of real curves passing through configurations that differ by a pair of complex conjugated points, and a correspondence Welschinger invariant of the blow up.
  We prove this analogue for the motivic count of rational curves of fixed degree passing through a generic configuration of points, counted with a motivic multiplicity in the Grothendieck-Witt ring of a base field, extending the notions in the correspondence theorem between motivic invariants for $k$-rational point conditions and tropical curves.
  We use this formula to compute the degree 4 motivic enumerative invariants of the projective plane counting curves passing through configurations of points defined over quadratic extensions of a base field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study unramified unitary and unitary similitude groups in an odd number of variables. Using work of the first and third named authors on the Kottwitz Conjecture for the similitude groups, we show that the Fargues--Scholze local Langlands correspondence agrees with the semi-simplification of the local Langlands correspondences constructed by Mok for the groups we consider. This compatibility result is then combined with the spectral action constructed by Fargues--Scholze, to verify their categorical form of the local Langlands conjecture for supercuspidal $\ell$-parameters. We deduce Fargues' eigensheaf conjecture and prove the strongest form of Kottwitz's conjecture for the groups we consider, even in the case of non minuscule $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of endomorphisms of algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ denote an endomorphism of a smooth algebraic group $G$ over the algebraic closure of a finite field, and assume all iterates of $\sigma$ have finitely many fixed points. Steinberg gave a formula for the number of fixed points of $\sigma$ (and hence of all of its iterates $\sigma^n$) in the semisimple case, leading to a representation of its Artin-Mazur zeta function as a rational function. We generalise this to an arbitrary (smooth) algebraic group $G$, where the number of fixed points $\sigma_n$ of $\sigma^n$ can depend on $p$-adic properties of $n$. We axiomatise the structure of the sequence $(\sigma_n)$ via the concept of a `finite-adelically distorted' (FAD-)sequence. Such sequences also occur in topological dynamics, and our subsequent results about zeta functions and asymptotic counting of orbits apply equally well in that situation; for example, to $S$-integer dynamical systems, additive cellular automata and other compact abelian groups. We prove dichotomies for the associated Artin-Mazur zeta function, and study the analogue of the Prime Number Theorem for the function counting periodic orbits of length $\leq N$. For an algebraic group $G$ we express the error term via the $\ell$-adic cohomological zeta function of $G$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Auslander-Reiten duality and Morita theorem for singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Morita theorem to construct triangle equivalences between the singularity categories of (commutative and non-commutative) Gorenstein rings and the cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras over fields, and more strongly, quasi-equivalences between their canonical dg enhancements. More precisely, we prove that such an equivalence exists as soon as we find a quasi-equivalence between the graded dg singularity category of a Gorenstein ring and the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which can be done by finding a single tilting object.
  Our result is based on two key theorems on dg enhancements of cluster categories and of singularity categories, which are of independent interest. First we give a Morita-type theorem which realizes certain $\mathbb{Z}$-graded dg categories as dg orbit categories. Secondly, we show that the canonical dg enhancements of the singularity categories of symmetric orders have the bimodule Calabi-Yau property, which lifts the classical Auslander-Reiten duality on singularity categories.
  We apply our results to such classes of rings as Gorenstein rings of dimension at most $1$, quotient singularities, and Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections, including finite or infinite Grassmannian cluster categories, to realize their singularity categories as cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Multiband linear cellular automata and endomorphisms of algebraic vector groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a correspondence between certain multiband linear cellular automata - models of computation widely used in the description of physical phenomena - and endomorphisms of certain algebraic unipotent groups over finite fields. The correspondence is based on the construction of a universal element specialising to a normal generator for any finite field. We use this correspondence to deduce new results concerning the temporal dynamics of such automata, using our prior, purely algebraic, study of the endomorphism ring of vector groups. These produce 'for free' a formula for the number of fixed points of the $n$-iterate in terms of the $p$-adic valuation of $n$, a dichotomy for the Artin-Mazur dynamical zeta function, and an asymptotic formula for the number of periodic orbits. Since multiband linear cellular automata simulate higher order linear automata (in which states depend on finitely many prior temporal states, not just the direct predecessor), the results apply equally well to that class.</description>

      <title>Explicit arithmetic Eisenstein cocycles: the toric case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct cocycles for $GL_n(\mathbb{Q})$ valued in cup products of units on the $n$-dimensional algebraic torus $\mathbb{G}_m^n$ over an arbitrary DVR, viewed in Milnor $K$-theory or motivic cohomology. We show how various combinatorially-defined complexes encoding linear algebraic data capture the structure of these cup products inside motivic complexes, and examine some properties of the resulting classes. This generalizes work of Sharifi and Venkatesh in the case $n=2$, in which case pullbacks of the resulting cocycle to an arithmetic base are of central importance in the Sharifi conjectures.</description>

      <title>Semialgebraic Calderon-Zygmund theorem on regularization of the distance function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for any closed semialgebraic subset $W$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and for any positive integer $p$, there exists a Nash function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\setminus W\longrightarrow (0, \infty)$ which is equivalent to the distance function from $W$ and at the same time it is $\Lambda_p$-regular in the sense that $|D^\alpha f(x)|\leq C d(x, W)^{1- |\alpha|}$, for each $x\in \mathbb{R}^n\setminus W$ and each $\alpha\in \mathbb{N}^n$ such that $1\leq |\alpha|\leq p$, where $C$ is a positive constant. In particular, $f$ is Lipschitz. Some applications of this result are given.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Constraints on Common Lines in Cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the topic of common lines between projection images in single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We derive a novel low-rank constraint on a certain $2n \times n$ matrix storing properly-scaled basis vectors for the common lines between $n$ projection images of one molecular conformation. Using this algebraic constraint and others, we give optimization algorithms to denoise common lines and recover the unknown 3D rotations associated to the images. As an application, we develop a clustering algorithm to partition a set of noisy images into homogeneous communities using common lines, in the case of discrete heterogeneity in cryo-EM. We demonstrate the methods on synthetic and experimental datasets.</description>
