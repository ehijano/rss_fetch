      <title>Cost-Control in Display Advertising: Theory vs Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In display advertising, advertisers want to achieve a marketing objective with constraints on budget and cost-per-outcome. This is usually formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes the total utility under constraints. The optimization is carried out in an online fashion in the dual space - for an incoming Ad auction, a bid is placed using an optimal bidding formula, assuming optimal values for the dual variables; based on the outcome of the previous auctions, the dual variables are updated in an online fashion. While this approach is theoretically sound, in practice, the dual variables are not optimal from the beginning, but rather converge over time. Specifically, for the cost-constraint, the convergence is asymptotic. As a result, we find that cost-control is ineffective. In this work, we analyse the shortcomings of the optimal bidding formula and propose a modification that deviates from the theoretical derivation. We simulate various practical scenarios and study the cost-control behaviors of the two algorithms. Through a large-scale evaluation on the real-word data, we show that the proposed modification reduces the cost violations by 50%, thereby achieving a better cost-control than the theoretical bidding formula.</description>

      <title>Learning in Games with progressive hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When learning to play an imperfect information game, it is often easier to first start with the basic mechanics of the game rules. For example, one can play several example rounds with private cards revealed to all players to better understand the basic actions and their effects. Building on this intuition, this paper introduces {\it progressive hiding}, an algorithm that learns to play imperfect information games by first learning the basic mechanics and then progressively adding information constraints over time. Progressive hiding is inspired by methods from stochastic multistage optimization such as scenario decomposition and progressive hedging. We prove that it enables the adaptation of counterfactual regret minimization to games where perfect recall is not satisfied. Numerical experiments illustrate that progressive hiding can achieve optimal payoff in a benchmark of emergent communication trading game.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion Without Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been substantial recent concern that pricing algorithms might learn to ``collude.'' Supra-competitive prices can emerge as a Nash equilibrium of repeated pricing games, in which sellers play strategies which threaten to punish their competitors who refuse to support high prices, and these strategies can be automatically learned. In fact, a standard economic intuition is that supra-competitive prices emerge from either the use of threats, or a failure of one party to optimize their payoff. Is this intuition correct? Would preventing threats in algorithmic decision-making prevent supra-competitive prices when sellers are optimizing for their own revenue? No. We show that supra-competitive prices can emerge even when both players are using algorithms which do not encode threats, and which optimize for their own revenue. We study sequential pricing games in which a first mover deploys an algorithm and then a second mover optimizes within the resulting environment. We show that if the first mover deploys any algorithm with a no-regret guarantee, and then the second mover even approximately optimizes within this now static environment, monopoly-like prices arise. The result holds for any no-regret learning algorithm deployed by the first mover and for any pricing policy of the second mover that obtains them profit at least as high as a random pricing would -- and hence the result applies even when the second mover is optimizing only within a space of non-responsive pricing distributions which are incapable of encoding threats. In fact, there exists a set of strategies, neither of which explicitly encode threats that form a Nash equilibrium of the simultaneous pricing game in algorithm space, and lead to near monopoly prices. This suggests that the definition of ``algorithmic collusion'' may need to be expanded, to include strategies without explicitly encoded threats.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Finding the Best Pure Nash Equilibrium in Edge-weighted Budgeted Maximum Coverage Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new integer programming game (IPG) named the Edge-weighted Budgeted Maximum Coverage (EBMC) game and proposes a new algorithm, the Best Response Plus (BR-plus) algorithm, for finding the best Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE). We demonstrate this methodology by optimizing county-level decisions to prevent aquatic invasive species (AIS) in Minnesota lakes, where each county-level decision makers has self-serving objectives while AIS is an interconnected issue that crosses county borders. Specifically, we develop EBMC games to model the strategic interactions among county-level decision-makers with two variations in utility functions. We also study and prove the existence of a PNE in these models under specified conditions. We advance the current state-of-the-art, which is limited to only a few players, by presenting the BR-plus algorithm that can handle a large set of players via utilizing the best response dynamics for finding PNE in normal-form games. Experimental results show that our BR-plus algorithm offers computational advantages over the ZR algorithm, especially in larger games, on both random and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>A Stackelberg Game based on the Secretary Problem: Optimal Response is History Dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers a problem arising from a two-player game based on the classical secretary problem. First, Player 1 selects one object from a sequence as in the secretary problem. All of the other objects are then presented to Player 2 in the same order as in the original sequence. The goal of both players is to select the best object. The optimal response of Player 2 is adapted to the optimal strategy in the secretary problem. This means that when Player 2 observes an object that is the best seen so far, it can be inferred whether Player 1 selected one of the earlier objects in the original sequence. However, Player 2 cannot compare the current object with the one selected by Player 1. Hence, this game defines an auxiliary problem in which Player 2 has incomplete information on the relative rank of an object. It is shown that the optimal strategy of Player 2 is based on both the number of objects to have appeared and the probability that the current object is better than the object chosen by Player 1 (if Player 1 chose an earlier object in the sequence). However, this probability is dependent on the previously observed objects. A lower bound on the optimal expected reward in the auxiliary problem is defined by limiting the memory of Player 2. An upper bound is derived by giving Player 2 additional information at appropriate times. The methods used illustrate approaches that can be used to approximate the optimal reward in a stopping problem when there is incomplete information on the ranks of objects and/or the optimal strategy is history dependent, as in the Robbins' problem</description>

      <title>Runtime analysis of a coevolutionary algorithm on impartial combinatorial games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their complex dynamics, combinatorial games are a key test case and application for algorithms that train game playing agents. Among those algorithms that train using self-play are coevolutionary algorithms (CoEAs). CoEAs evolve a population of individuals by iteratively selecting the strongest based on their interactions against contemporaries, and using those selected as parents for the following generation (via randomised mutation and crossover). However, the successful application of CoEAs for game playing is difficult due to pathological behaviours such as cycling, an issue especially critical for games with intransitive payoff landscapes.
  Insight into how to design CoEAs to avoid such behaviours can be provided by runtime analysis. In this paper, we push the scope of runtime analysis to combinatorial games, proving a general upper bound for the number of simulated games needed for UMDA (a type of CoEA) to discover (with high probability) an optimal strategy for an impartial combinatorial game. This result applies to any impartial combinatorial game, and for many games the implied bound is polynomial or quasipolynomial as a function of the number of game positions. After proving the main result, we provide several applications to simple well-known games: Nim, Chomp, Silver Dollar, and Turning Turtles. As the first runtime analysis for CoEAs on combinatorial games, this result is a critical step towards a comprehensive theoretical framework for coevolution.</description>

      <title>MATWA: A Web Toolkit for Matching under Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching markets, where agents are assigned to one another based on preferences and capacity constraints, are pervasive in various domains. This paper introduces MATWA (https://matwa.optimalmatching.com), a web application offering a rich collection of algorithms for fundamental problem models involving matching under preferences. MATWA provides results and visualizations of matching algorithm outputs based on different methods for providing problem instances. In this paper, we describe the features of the system, illustrating its usage for different problem models, and outlining the algorithm implementations that are supported. We also give evidence of usability testing and illustrate how the system was used to obtain new empirical results for a specific matching problem. MATWA is intended to be a resource for the community of researchers in the area of matching under preferences, supporting experimentation as well as aiding the understanding of matching algorithms.</description>

      <title>Forming a ranking from tied evaluations: a case of an online, interactive student peer assessment system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13774v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative peer grading activities may keep students engaged during in-class project presentations. Effective methods for collecting and aggregating peer assessment data are essential. Students tend to grade projects favorably. So, while asking students for numeric grades is a common approach, it often leads to inflated grades across all projects, resulting in numerous ties for the top grades. Additionally, students may strategically assign lower grades to others' projects so that their projects will shine. Alternatively, requesting students to rank all projects from best to worst presents challenges due to limitations in human cognitive capacity. To address these issues, we propose a novel peer grading model consisting of (a) an algorithm designed to elicit student evaluations and (b) a median-based voting protocol for aggregating grades to a single ranked order that reduces ties. An application based on our model was deployed and tested in a university course, demonstrating fewer ties between alternatives and a significant decrease in</description>

      <title>The Potential of Self-Regulation for Front-Running Prevention on DEXes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transaction ordering dependency of the smart contracts building decentralized exchanges (DEXes) allow for predatory trading strategies. In particular, front-running attacks present a constant risk for traders on DEXes. Whereas legal regulation outlaws most front-running practices in traditional finance, such measures are ineffective in preventing front-running on DEXes. While novel market designs hindering front-running may emerge, it remains unclear whether the market's participants, in particular, liquidity providers, would be willing to adopt these new designs. A misalignment of the participant's private incentives and the market's social incentives can hinder the market from adopting an effective prevention mechanism.
  We present a game-theoretic model to study the behavior of sophisticated traders, retail traders, and liquidity providers in DEXes. Sophisticated traders adjust for front-running attacks, while retail traders do not, likely due to lack of knowledge or irrationality. Our findings show that with less than 1% of order flow from retail traders, traders' and liquidity providers' interests align with the market's social incentives - eliminating front-running attacks. However, the benefit from embracing this novel market is often small and may not suffice to entice them. With retail traders making up a larger proportion (around 10%) of the order flow, liquidity providers tend to stay in pools that do not protect against front-running. This suggests both educating traders and providing additional incentives for liquidity providers are necessary for market self-regulation.</description>

      <title>Towards An Analytical Framework for Dynamic Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential game is an emerging notion and framework for studying N-player games, especially with heterogeneous players. In this paper, we build an analytical framework for dynamic potential games. We prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if and only if each player's value function can be decomposed as a potential function and a residual term which is solely dependent on other players' policies. This decomposition is consistent with the result in the static setting and enables us to identify and analyze an important and new class of dynamic potential games called the distributed game. Moreover, we prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if the value function has a symmetric Jacobian. This generalizes the differential characterization for static potential games by replacing the classical derivative with a new notation of functional derivative with respect to Markov policies. For a general class of continuous-time stochastic games, we explicitly characterize their potential functions. In particular, we show that the potential function of linear-quadratic games can be studied through a system of linear ODEs. Furthermore, under a rank condition on control coefficients, we prove a linear-quadratic game is a Markov potential game if and only if all players have identical cost functions.</description>
