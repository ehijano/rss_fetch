      <title>TLOB: A Novel Transformer Model with Dual Attention for Stock Price Trend Prediction with Limit Order Book Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stock Price Trend Prediction (SPTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a fundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning, existing models fail to generalize across different market conditions and struggle to reliably predict short-term trends. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we show that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of complex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the horizon bias. We evaluate TLOB's effectiveness using the established FI-2010 benchmark, which exceeds the state-of-the-art by an average of 3.7 F1-score(\%). Additionally, TLOB shows improvements on Tesla and Intel with a 1.3 and 7.7 increase in F1-score(\%), respectively. Additionally, we empirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time (-6.68 absolute points in F1-score(\%)), highlighting the growing market efficiencies. Predictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial AI. We release the code at https://github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB.</description>

      <title>Efficient mid-term forecasting of hourly electricity load using generalized additive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate mid-term (weeks to one year) hourly electricity load forecasts are essential for strategic decision-making in power plant operation, ensuring supply security and grid stability, planning and building energy storage systems, and energy trading. While numerous models effectively predict short-term (hours to a few days) hourly load, mid-term forecasting solutions remain scarce. In mid-term load forecasting, capturing the multifaceted characteristics of load, including daily, weekly and annual seasonal patterns, as well as autoregressive effects, weather and holiday impacts, and socio-economic non-stationarities, presents significant modeling challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel forecasting method using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) built from interpretable P-splines that is enhanced with autoregressive post-processing. This model incorporates smoothed temperatures, Error-Trend-Seasonal (ETS) modeled and persistently forecasted non-stationary socio-economic states, a nuanced representation of effects from vacation periods, fixed date and weekday holidays, and seasonal information as inputs. The proposed model is evaluated using load data from 24 European countries over more than 9 years (2015-2024). This analysis demonstrates that the model not only has significantly enhanced forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods but also offers valuable insights into the influence of individual components on predicted load, given its full interpretability. Achieving performance akin to day-ahead Transmission System Operator (TSO) forecasts, with computation times of just a few seconds for several years of hourly data, underscores the potential of the model for practical application in the power system industry.</description>
