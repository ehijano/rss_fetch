      <title>Efficient modeling of sub-kilometer surface wind with Gaussian processes and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately representing surface weather at the sub-kilometer scale is crucial for optimal decision-making in a wide range of applications. This motivates the use of statistical techniques to provide accurate and calibrated probabilistic predictions at a lower cost compared to numerical simulations. Wind represents a particularly challenging variable to model due to its high spatial and temporal variability. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates Gaussian processes (GPs) and neural networks to model surface wind gusts, leveraging multiple data sources, including numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, digital elevation models (DEM), and in-situ measurements. Results demonstrate the added value of modeling the multivariate covariance structure of the variable of interest, as opposed to only applying a univariate probabilistic regression approach. Modeling the covariance enables the optimal integration of observed measurements from ground stations, which is shown to reduce the continuous ranked probability score compared to the baseline. Moreover, it allows the direct generation of realistic fields that are also marginally calibrated, aided by scalable techniques such as Random Fourier Features (RFF) and pathwise conditioning. We discuss the effect of different modeling choices, as well as different degrees of approximation, and present our results for a case study.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Eddy Identification with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies are critical in ocean circulation and the global climate system. Standard eddy identification methods are usually based on deterministic optimal point estimates of the ocean flow field, which produce a single best estimate without accounting for inherent uncertainties in the data. However, large uncertainty exists in estimating the flow field due to the use of noisy, sparse, and indirect observations, as well as turbulent flow models. When this uncertainty is overlooked, the accuracy of eddy identification is significantly affected. This paper presents a general probabilistic eddy identification framework that adapts existing methods to incorporate uncertainty into the diagnostic. The framework begins by sampling an ensemble of ocean realizations from the probabilistic state estimation, which considers uncertainty. Traditional eddy diagnostics are then applied to individual realizations, and the corresponding eddy statistics are aggregated from these diagnostic results. The framework is applied to a scenario mimicking the Beaufort Gyre marginal ice zone, where large uncertainty appears in estimating the ocean field using Lagrangian data assimilation with sparse ice floe trajectories. The probabilistic eddy identification precisely characterizes the contribution from the turbulent fluctuations and provides additional insights in comparison to its deterministic counterpart. The skills in counting the number of eddies and computing the probability of the eddy are both significantly improved under the probabilistic framework. Notably, large biases appear when estimating the eddy lifetime using deterministic methods. In contrast, probabilistic eddy identification not only provides a closer estimate but also quantifies the uncertainty in inferring such a crucial dynamical quantity.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Earth's Albedo: The K\"ohler Equation at Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing marine haze and clouds has been considered as a possible means of increasing the Earth's albedo. This would reduce Solar heating and global warming, counteracting the effects of the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gases. One proposed method of doing so would inject small droplets of seawater or condensation nuclei into the marine boundary layer, creating artificial haze and cloud. The equilibrium size of such droplets is described by the K\"{o}hler equation that includes the vapor pressure reduction attributable to the solute according to Raoult's law and the vapor pressure increase of a small droplet as a result of surface tension according to Kelvin. Here we apply this classic result to small droplets in the marine boundary layer, where the partial pressure of water vapor is less than the equilibrium vapor pressure because it is in equilibrium with the saline ocean. We calculate the equilibrium size of a droplet containing dissolved ions and find that the radius of a droplet of seawater shrinks greatly before it achieves equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The impact of the explicit representation of convection on the climate of a tidally locked planet in global stretched-mesh simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convective processes are crucial in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres but are computationally expensive to simulate directly. A novel technique of simulating moist convection on tidally locked exoplanets is to use a global 3D model with a stretched mesh. This allows us to locally refine the model resolution to 4.7 km and resolve fine-scale convective processes without relying on parameterizations. We explore the impact of mesh stretching on the climate of a slowly rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planet, assuming it is 1:1 tidally locked. In the stretched-mesh simulation with explicit convection, the climate is 5 K colder and 25% drier than that in the simulations with parameterized convection (with both stretched and quasi-uniform meshes)}. This is due to the increased cloud reflectivity - because of an increase of low-level cloudiness - and exacerbated by the diminished greenhouse effect due to less water vapor. At the same time, our stretched-mesh simulations reproduce the key characteristics of the global climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets, without any noticeable numerical artifacts. Our methodology opens an exciting and computationally feasible avenue for improving our understanding of 3D mixing in exoplanetary atmospheres. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of a global stretched mesh configuration for LFRic-Atmosphere, the next-generation Met Office climate and weather model.</description>
