      <title>Cross-Interaction Softness as a Route to Microphase Separation in Binary Colloidal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how interparticle interactions govern phase behavior is central to controlling self-organization in multicomponent soft-matter systems. In particular, the role of cross-interactions between unlike components remains insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically investigate how cross-interaction character controls phase behavior in binary mixtures of hard and soft particles using coarse-grained modeling, Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. Four representative systems are examined that differ only in whether interactions between unlike particles are bounded or hard-sphere. We show that penetrable (bounded) cross-interactions are both necessary and sufficient to induce microphase separation, even in the absence of attractive forces. Such systems exhibit dispersed states, macrophase separation, and microphase-separated morphologies characterized by finite-wavelength compositional ordering. In contrast, purely hard-sphere cross interactions suppress microphase separation entirely, despite strong local clustering. Comparison between theory and simulations reveals qualitative agreement in phase topology, while simulations additionally capture hierarchical and multiscale ordering near crossover regimes. These findings establish cross-interaction softness as a fundamental design principle for controlling phase behavior in multicomponent colloidal and soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Toward a theoretical framework for self-diffusiophoretic propulsion near a wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the self-diffusiophoretic motion of a catalytically active spherical particle confined within a wedge-shaped domain. Using the Fourier-Kontorovich-Lebedev transform, we solve the Laplace equation for the concentration field in the diffusion-dominated regime. The method of images is employed to obtain the first and second reflections of the concentration field, accounting for both monopole and dipole contributions of the particle's surface activity. Based on these results, we derive leading-order expressions for the self-induced phoretic velocity in the far-field limit and examine how it varies with the wedge opening angle and the particle's position within the domain. Our findings reveal that the wedge geometry significantly affects both the magnitude and direction of particle motion. Our study provides a systematic framework for understanding active particle dynamics near corners, with implications for microfluidic design and control of autophoretic particles in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Origin of geometric cohesion in non-convex granular materials: interplay between interdigitation and rotational constraints enhancing frictional stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of experiments investigating the local microstructure of cylindrical piles composed of highly concave particles. By systematically varying particle geometry -- from spheres to strongly non-convex polypods -- as well as frictional properties and the number of branches, we explore how these parameters, together with the preparation protocol, shape the internal structure of the system. Using X-ray tomography combined with a dedicated image-analysis pipeline, we accurately extract the position, orientation, and contacts of every particle in each pile. This allows us to quantify the evolution of key structural observables as a function of particle geometry and preparation method. In particular, we measure the distributions of local packing fraction, coordination number, number of neighbors, and contact locations, along with particle-particle positional and orientational correlations. More importantly, we construct a new stability indicator that correlates perfectly with the observed pile stabilities, enabling us to identify the fundamental mechanisms responsible for \textit{geometrically induced cohesion} in granular systems composed of non-interlocking particle shapes: interdigitation, rotational constraint, friction-mediated cohesion, and the ability of a pile to re-stabilize.</description>

      <title>Wrinkles, rucks and folds formed in a heavy sheet on a frictional surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft elastic sheets resting on rigid surfaces develop wrinkles, rucks, and folds due to the combined influence of elasticity, gravity, and contact interactions. Despite their ubiquity, the principles governing their morphology and transitions remain unclear. We introduce a minimal experiment in which the center of a gravity-loaded sheet is gradually lifted from the supporting plane. This operation generates a clear sequence of shapes: an axisymmetric uplift, a finite number of wrinkles, system-spanning rucks produced by global buckling, and folded states that can arise from ruck collapse upon unloading at larger lifts. Combining experiments, finite-element simulations, and F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an theory, we establish a unified physical picture of this morphology sequence. In the frictionless case, elasticity and gravity alone govern the response, leading to a universal wrinkling threshold: the wrinkle number is fixed and the onset displacement scales linearly with the sheet thickness. With interfacial friction, the wrinkled state is described by introducing an additional nondimensional parameter that compares frictional and elastic-gravitational forces. These results suggest a simple route to programmable sheet morphogenesis via friction and gravity.</description>

      <title>Stretching and Compressing Capillary Bridges on Hydrophilic, Hydrophobic, and Liquid-infused Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous capillary liquid bridges are ubiquitous in nature and in technological processes. Here, we comparatively investigate capillary bridges formed between three distinct types of surfaces: (i) hydrophilic glass, (ii) hydrophobic dichlorodimethylsilane (DMS)-functionalized glass, and (iii) silicone-oil-infused LIS. We combine experimental measurements and computer simulations of the capillary bridge evolution upon changes in the gap size between the surfaces, deriving in each case the bridge geometry and the resulting capillary force. The results, also compared with predictions from the existing theory, follow expected trends on glass and DMS-functionalized surfaces: contact line pinning dominates the bridge behavior on glass with a characteristic stick-slip motion, whereas a pronounced advancing and receding hysteresis is observed on DMS surfaces. On LIS, the absence of pinning leads to minimal force variation, gravity-driven breaking of the bridge symmetry, and possible liquid exchange between LIS through bridge cloaking. These effects become particularly significant in asymmetric bridge configurations combining LIS and DMS surfaces, where the transfer of lubricant from LIS to DMS modifies the effective surface tension and alters bridge-surface interactions. Our systematic comparison of the capillary bridge behavior across solid and liquid interfaces with varying wettability provides a foundation for designing functional surface applications with controlled bridge-surface interactions.</description>

      <title>Automated decision-making by chemical echolocation in active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motile microorganisms, like bacteria and algae, unify abilities like self-propulsion, autonomous navigation, and decision-making on the micron scale. While recent breakthroughs have led to the creation of synthetic microswimmers and nanoagents that can also self-propel, they still lack the functionality and sophistication of their biological counterparts. This study pioneers a mechanism enabling synthetic agents to autonomously navigate and make decisions, allowing them to solve mazes and transport cargo through complex environments without requiring external cues or guidance. The mechanism exploits chemo-hydrodynamic signals, produced by agents like active droplets or colloids, to remotely sense and respond to their environment - similar to echolocation. Our research paves the way for endowing autonomous, motile synthetic agents with functionalities that have been so far exclusive to biological organisms.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of pressure activated assembly of supramolecules in isochoric and isobaric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficacy of cryopreservation is constrained by the difficulty of achieving sufficiently high intracellular concentrations of cryoprotective solutes without inducing osmotic injury or chemical toxicity during loading. This thermodynamic study introduces a new conceptual mechanism for cryoprotectant delivery into cells directly or through vascular perfusion. In this framework, effective cryoprotection could be achieved through the in situ generation of high intracellular concentrations of cryoprotective solutes via pressure-activated disassembly of membrane-permeant supramolecular assemblies composed of cryoprotectant monomers or oligomers. These supramolecules, present initially at low concentrations, are envisioned to enter cells through passive partitioning or endocytosis with minimal osmotic effect, and subsequently transform into a high intracellular concentration of cryoprotectants upon disassembly. We propose that elevated hydrostatic pressure, generated intrinsically during isochoric (constant-volume) freezing or applied externally under isobaric (constant-pressure) conditions, can destabilize supramolecular assemblies whose dissociated state occupies a smaller molar volume than the assembled state. Under isochoric freezing, ice formation within a fixed volume produces a substantial pressure increase as a thermodynamic consequence of phase change, rendering pressure a dependent variable governed by the Helmholtz free energy. Under isobaric conditions, pressure acts as an externally controlled variable through the Gibbs free energy. In both formulations, pressure-activated disassembly decouples membrane transport from cryoprotectant availability and enables synchronized solute generation precisely during cooling or freezing, without pre-loading of osmotically active solutes.</description>

      <title>Reversibility, Chaos, and Attractors in Periodically Sheared Elastic Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of filaments in flow are central to understanding a wide range of biological and soft-matter systems, yet their behavior under time-dependent forcing remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the long-time dynamics of Brownian inextensible elastic filaments subjected to strong uniform oscillatory shear by combining microfluidic experiments on actin filaments with numerical simulations based on a fluctuating Euler-Bernoulli elastica model in a viscous fluid. As the oscillation period increases, irreversibility emerges from the interplay of flow-induced deformations and thermal noise. This leads to a departure from reversible, deterministic rigid-body dynamics: in this regime, the filaments cycle between nearly straight, flow-aligned conformations at full periods and buckled shapes at half periods. Owing to the time-glide symmetry of the system, two such attracting states in fact coexist with a phase shift of half a period. The system spontaneously selects one, but occasionally switches between them as a result of noise, producing intermittent transitions between apparent order and disorder. This system constitutes an experimentally accessible realization of stochastic symmetry breaking, attractor hopping, and intermittency in a minimal nonequilibrium soft-matter system, with novel implications for the design and control of soft matter systems under time-dependent flows.</description>

      <title>Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description>

      <title>Modelling the movements of organisms by stochastic theory in a comoving frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine you walk in a plane. You move by making a step of a certain length per time interval in a chosen direction. Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic flows induced by localized torques (rotlets) in wedge-shaped geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wedge-shaped geometries in low-Reynolds-number flows are of increasing importance, for instance, in the design of microfluidic devices. The corresponding Green's functions describing the induced flow in response to a locally applied force were derived some time ago. To achieve a complete characterization of particle motion at low Reynolds numbers, we derive the flow response to locally applied torques. This is accomplished through a direct calculation based on the Fourier-Kontorovich-Lebedev transform. We then illustrate the resulting flow fields, highlighting their structure, key features, and dependence on the geometry and orientation of the applied torque. Based on these solutions, we compute the corresponding hydrodynamic mobility tensor that couples torque and motion. Owing to the broken spatial symmetry imposed by the wedge-shaped confinement, a particle subjected to a torque will experience not only rotational motion but also translational motion. These results provide analytical tools relevant for predicting and controlling particle behavior in confined microfluidic environments.</description>

      <title>Tiling by Near Coincidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns of twisted and scaled bilayers have recently emerged as a fertile source of quasiperiodic order in two-dimensional materials. Inspired by these systems, we introduce the \emph{near-coincidence method} for generating quasiperiodic tilings of the plane. The method is intuitive -- admitting pairs of nearly coincident points from superimposed layers -- yet rigorous, as it maps naturally to the well-established cut-and-project formalism. It reproduces classical tilings, including the Ammann--Beenker, the Niizeki--G\"ahler, and the square and hexagonal Fibonacci tilings. It also uncovers new tilings not likely to arise in conventional constructions, with relative frequencies of local configurations that may take transcendental values. The near-coincidence method is algorithmically simple and already realized in an application that generates tilings from specified layer parameters and coincidence conditions. Future extensions include trilayer systems, where preliminary results yield dodecagonal order with square layers, and very small twist angles, where the method may capture the giant moir\'e patterns of bilayer and trilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Indentation of an elastic arch on a frictional substrate: Pinning, unfolding and snapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the morphology and mechanics of a naturally curved elastic arch loaded at its center and frictionally supported at both ends on a flat, rigid substrate. Through systematic numerical simulations, we classify the observed behaviors of the arch into three distinct types of configurations in terms of the arch geometry and the coefficient of static friction with the substrate. A linear theory is developed based on a planar elastica model combined with Amontons-Coulomb's frictional law, which quantitatively explains the numerically constructed phase diagram. The snapping transition of a loaded arch in a sufficiently large indentation regime, which involves a discontinuous force jump, is numerically observed. The proposed model problem allows a fully analytical investigation and demonstrates a rich variety of mechanical behaviors owing to the interplay between elasticity, geometry, and friction. This study provides a basis for understanding more common but complex systems, such as a cylindrical shell subjected to a concentrated load and simultaneously supported by frictional contact with surrounding objects.</description>

Abstract: The relation between dynamics and structure in systems of Brownian bidisperse 2D hard disks with arrested dynamics is examined using numerical simulations. Surprisingly, the suspensions show dynamic arrest at an area fraction of {\phi} {\approx} 0.777 over a wide range of disk-size ratios. This is in close agreement with the experimental findings of [Nat. Mater. 18, 1118 (2019)] ({\phi} {\approx} 0.776) for a quasi-2D colloidal suspension of spheres with large-to-small size ratio of approximately 1.4. Intriguingly, this also matches a jamming transition ({\phi} {\approx} 0.773 to 0.777) found experimentally in a 2D bidisperse granular packing of disks for a similar aspect ratio [Powders and Grains (2025)]. Adopting a geometric viewpoint allows for the identification of the floret pentagonal tiling ({\phi} {\approx} 0.777343), which is comprised of congruent (elongated) pentagonal tiles. In analogy to foam and tissue models, it is the presence of this congruent reference state that induces a dynamical transition in the disordered fluid of the disks. That is, the change in dynamics observed both in a uniformly compressed granular medium and a colloidal one at finite temperature are implied to be caused by the same topological mechanism. Extending this reasoning to a honeycomb lattice could also explain the experimentally observed onset of caging dynamics ({\phi} {\approx} 0.6) in a similar bidisperse, quasi-2D system of colloidal spheres [Nature 587, 225 (2020)]. An outlook is provided on how this concept may be applied to 3D: removing one in four particles from a face-centered-cubic arrangement leads to a square bipyramidal honeycomb} with associated volume fraction {\eta} {\approx} 0.55536. The ideas put forward here thus also provide a possible origin for random loose packing of (frictional) hard spheres in 3D and can potentially shed light onto the nature of the glass transition.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in coupled viscoelastic media: A fractional Langevin equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08291</link>

Abstract: Anomalous diffusion often arises in complex environments where viscoelastic or crowded conditions influence particle motion. In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a subdiffusive particle ($\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains its intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\alpha&lt;\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\alpha=\beta$) suppress recovery. Our theoretical predictions offer insight into experimentally observed transient anomalous diffusions, such as polymer--protein complexes and cross-linked cytoskeletal networks, highlighting the critical role of memory heterogeneity and mechanical interactions in biological anomalous diffusion.</description>
