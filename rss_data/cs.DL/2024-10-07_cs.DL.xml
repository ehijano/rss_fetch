      <title>Mov-Avg: Codeless time series analysis using moving averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Mov-Avg, the Python software package for time series analysis that requires little computer programming experience from the user. The package allows the identification of trends, patterns, and the prediction of future events based on data collected over time. In this regard, the Mov-Avg implementation provides three indicators to apply, namely: Simple Moving Average, Weighted Moving Average and Exponential Moving Average. Due to its generic design, the Mov-Avg software package can be used in any field where the application of moving averages is valid. In general, the Mov-Avg library for time series analysis contributes to a better understanding of data-driven processes over time by taking advantage of moving averages in any way adapted to the research context.</description>

      <title>Orphan Articles: The Dark Matter of Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With 60M articles in more than 300 language versions, Wikipedia is the largest platform for open and freely accessible knowledge. While the available content has been growing continuously at a rate of around 200K new articles each month, very little attention has been paid to the accessibility of the content. One crucial aspect of accessibility is the integration of hyperlinks into the network so the articles are visible to readers navigating Wikipedia. In order to understand this phenomenon, we conduct the first systematic study of orphan articles, which are articles without any incoming links from other Wikipedia articles, across 319 different language versions of Wikipedia. We find that a surprisingly large extent of content, roughly 15\% (8.8M) of all articles, is de facto invisible to readers navigating Wikipedia, and thus, rightfully term orphan articles as the dark matter of Wikipedia. We also provide causal evidence through a quasi-experiment that adding new incoming links to orphans (de-orphanization) leads to a statistically significant increase of their visibility in terms of the number of pageviews. We further highlight the challenges faced by editors for de-orphanizing articles, demonstrate the need to support them in addressing this issue, and provide potential solutions for developing automated tools based on cross-lingual approaches. Overall, our work not only unravels a key limitation in the link structure of Wikipedia and quantitatively assesses its impact, but also provides a new perspective on the challenges of maintenance associated with content creation at scale in Wikipedia.</description>

      <title>Assessing your Observatory's Impact: Best Practices in Establishing and Maintaining Observatory Bibliographies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observatories need to measure and evaluate the scientific output and overall impact of their facilities. An observatory bibliography consists of the papers published using that observatory's data, typically gathered by searching the major journals for relevant keywords. Recently, the volume of literature and methods by which the publications pool is evaluated has increased. Efficient and standardized procedures are necessary to assign meaningful metadata; enable user-friendly retrieval; and provide the opportunity to derive reports, statistics, and visualizations to impart a deeper understanding of the research output. In 2021, a group of observatory bibliographers from around the world convened online to continue the discussions presented in Lagerstrom (2015). We worked to extract general guidelines from our experiences, techniques, and lessons learnt. The paper explores the development, application, and current status of telescope bibliographies and future trends. This paper briefly describes the methodologies employed in constructing databases, along with the various bibliometric techniques used to analyze and interpret them. We explain reasons for non-standardization and why it is essential for each observatory to identify metadata and metrics that are meaningful for them; caution the (over-)use of comparisons among facilities that are, ultimately, not comparable through bibliometrics; and highlight the benefits of telescope bibliographies, both for researchers within the astronomical community and for stakeholders beyond the specific observatories. There is tremendous diversity in the ways bibliographers track publications and maintain databases, due to parameters such as resources, type of observatory, historical practices, and reporting requirements to funders and outside agencies. However, there are also common sets of Best Practices.</description>

      <title>Historical Ink: 19th Century Latin American Spanish Newspaper Corpus with LLM OCR Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two significant contributions: First, it introduces a novel dataset of 19th-century Latin American newspaper texts, addressing a critical gap in specialized corpora for historical and linguistic analysis in this region. Second, it develops a flexible framework that utilizes a Large Language Model for OCR error correction and linguistic surface form detection in digitized corpora. This semi-automated framework is adaptable to various contexts and datasets and is applied to the newly created dataset.</description>
