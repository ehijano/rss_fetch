      <title>Combining supervised and unsupervised learning methods to predict financial market movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decisions traders make to buy or sell an asset depend on various analyses, with expertise required to identify patterns that can be exploited for profit. In this paper we identify novel features extracted from emergent and well-established financial markets using linear models and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with the aim of finding profitable opportunities. We used approximately six months of data consisting of minute candles from the Bitcoin, Pepecoin, and Nasdaq markets to derive and compare the proposed novel features with commonly used ones. These features were extracted based on the previous 59 minutes for each market and used to identify predictions for the hour ahead. We explored the performance of various machine learning strategies, such as Random Forests (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) to classify market movements. A naive random approach to selecting trading decisions was used as a benchmark, with outcomes assumed to be equally likely. We used a temporal cross-validation approach using test sets of 40%, 30% and 20% of total hours to evaluate the learning algorithms' performances. Our results showed that filtering the time series facilitates algorithms' generalisation. The GMM filtering approach revealed that the KNN and RF algorithms produced higher average returns than the random algorithm.</description>

      <title>Peer-induced Fairness: A Causal Approach for Algorithmic Fairness Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02558v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act taking effect on 1 August 2024, high-risk AI applications must adhere to stringent transparency and fairness standards. This paper addresses a crucial question: how can we scientifically audit algorithmic fairness? Current methods typically remain at the basic detection stage of auditing, without accounting for more complex scenarios. We propose a novel framework, ``peer-induced fairness'', which combines the strengths of counterfactual fairness and peer comparison strategy, creating a reliable and robust tool for auditing algorithmic fairness. Our framework is universal, adaptable to various domains, and capable of handling different levels of data quality, including skewed distributions. Moreover, it can distinguish whether adverse decisions result from algorithmic discrimination or inherent limitations of the subjects, thereby enhancing transparency. This framework can serve as both a self-assessment tool for AI developers and an external assessment tool for auditors to ensure compliance with the EU AI Act. We demonstrate its utility in small and medium-sized enterprises access to finance, uncovering significant unfairness-41.51% of micro-firms face discrimination compared to non-micro firms. These findings highlight the framework's potential for broader applications in ensuring equitable AI-driven decision-making.</description>
