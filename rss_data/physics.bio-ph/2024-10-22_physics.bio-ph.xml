      <title>Surface-Emitting Resonator Interference Microscopy for Label-Free Monitoring of Membrane Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular membrane dynamics play an important role in a variety of physiological processes. However, due to the stringent light-coupling conditions required for exciting evanescent waves, label-free mapping of cellular membrane dynamics on curved substrates remains challenging. Here, we report surface-emitting resonator interference microscopy (SERIM), which employs the evanescent wave naturally present in the near-field region of a whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator to probe the subcellular membrane dynamics. The WGM resonator provides strong optical feedback for enhancing the light-mattering interaction and also provides a biomimetic curvature interface to investigate the membrane dynamics. The interaction of the evanescent wave with the cell membrane caused significant scattering, forming a highly sensitive interference pattern. We found that the time-resolved interference patterns can be utilized to extract subcellular membrane dynamics with a diffractive limited spatial resolution. We further employed the SERIM to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of membrane dynamics during migration, and also stimulus responses to temperature and drugs. In striking contrast to the conventional label-free methods, the easy excitation of the evanescent wave makes SERIM a versatile label-free strategy for studying cellular behavior on a curved surface. Our work holds promise for sensitive detection of subtle biochemical and biophysical information during cell-substrate interaction.</description>

      <title>Effect of Temperature and TiO$_{2}$ NP Concentration on DNA Stability under Conditions Close to Physiological Ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is devoted to the study of the thermostability of native DNA during binding to TiO$_{2}$ nanoparticles (NPs) at various concentrations under conditions close to physiological (0.1 M Na $^+$, pH 7) using thermal denaturation method and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The analysis of the DNA melting curves in the presence of TiO$_{2}$ NPs revealed a temperature range in which the light absorption of DNA decreases. This is explained by the formation of an ordered structure of partially unwound DNA strands on the NP surface. The DNA:TiO$_{2}$ NP nanoassemblies formed at the initial stages remained stable in the wide temperature range. The performed temperature-dependent DLS measurements of the DNA:TiO$_{2}$ NP suspension at pH 7 have not revealed the aggregation of the DNA:TiO$_{2}$ NP nanoassemblies that had been observed at pH 5.</description>

      <title>Latency correction in sparse neuronal spike trains with overlapping global events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: In Kreuz et al., J Neurosci Methods 381, 109703 (2022) two methods were proposed that perform latency correction, i.e., optimize the spike time alignment of sparse neuronal spike trains with well defined global spiking events. The first one based on direct shifts is fast but uses only partial latency information, while the other one makes use of the full information but relies on the computationally costly simulated annealing. Both methods reach their limits and can become unreliable when successive global events are not sufficiently separated or even overlap.
  New Method: Here we propose an iterative scheme that combines the advantages of the two original methods by using in each step as much of the latency information as possible and by employing a very fast extrapolation direct shift method instead of the much slower simulated annealing.
  Results: We illustrate the effectiveness and the improved performance, measured in terms of the relative shift error, of the new iterative scheme not only on simulated data with known ground truths but also on single-unit recordings from two medial superior olive neurons of a gerbil.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The iterative scheme outperforms the existing approaches on both the simulated and the experimental data. Due to its low computational demands, and in contrast to simulated annealing, it can also be applied to very large datasets.
  Conclusions: The new method generalizes and improves on the original method both in terms of accuracy and speed. Importantly, it is the only method that allows to disentangle global events with overlap.</description>

      <title>Generalized Flow Matching for Transition Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating transition dynamics between metastable states is a fundamental challenge in dynamical systems and stochastic processes with wide real-world applications in understanding protein folding, chemical reactions and neural activities. However, the computational challenge often lies on sampling exponentially many paths in which only a small fraction ends in the target metastable state due to existence of high energy barriers. To amortize the cost, we propose a data-driven approach to warm-up the simulation by learning nonlinear interpolations from local dynamics. Specifically, we infer a potential energy function from local dynamics data. To find plausible paths between two metastable states, we formulate a generalized flow matching framework that learns a vector field to sample propable paths between the two marginal densities under the learned energy function. Furthermore, we iteratively refine the model by assigning importance weights to the sampled paths and buffering more likely paths for training. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method to sample probable paths on both synthetic and real-world molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing adaptive sampling via Policy Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient sampling in biomolecular simulations is critical for accurately capturing the complex dynamical behaviors of biological systems. Adaptive sampling techniques aim to improve efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most relevant regions of phase space. In this work, we present a framework for identifying the optimal sampling policy through metric driven ranking. Our approach systematically evaluates the policy ensemble and ranks the policies based on their ability to explore the conformational space effectively. Through a series of biomolecular simulation case studies, we demonstrate that choice of a different adaptive sampling policy at each round significantly outperforms single policy sampling, leading to faster convergence and improved sampling performance. This approach takes an ensemble of adaptive sampling policies and identifies the optimal policy for the next round based on current data. Beyond presenting this ensemble view of adaptive sampling, we also propose two sampling algorithms that approximate this ranking framework on the fly. The modularity of this framework allows incorporation of any adaptive sampling policy making it versatile and suitable as a comprehensive adaptive sampling scheme.</description>

      <title>MINFLUX -- molecular resolution with minimal photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical super-resolution microscopy is a key technology for structural biology that optimally complements electron microscopy because of its high contrast and live-cell compatibility. MINFLUX is an emerging super-resolution technique that measures the precise position of single fluorophores by targeted scanning of a patterned excitation beam featuring a minimum. It achieves unprecedented localization precision for a given number of detected photons. In combination with switchable fluorophores, it can be used for super-resolution imaging with nanometer resolution. For tracking of single fluorophores, it greatly outperforms camera-based techniques and achieves nanometer spatial and sub-millisecond temporal resolution over long tracks. Here, we introduce the basic principle of MINFLUX and explain how it can reach such high photon efficiencies. We then discuss the potential and limitations of MINFLUX for super-resolution imaging and single-fluorophore tracking, describe recent extensions and variations of MINFLUX and give an outlook to future developments.</description>

      <title>Protein structure classification based on X-ray laser induced Coulomb explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulated the Coulomb explosion dynamics due to the fast ionization induced by high-intensity X-rays in six proteins that share similar atomic content and shape. We followed and projected the trajectory of the fragments onto a virtual detector, providing a unique explosion footprint. After collecting 500 explosion footprints for each protein, we utilized principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to classify these. The results show that the classification algorithms were able to separate proteins on the basis of explosion footprints from structurally similar proteins into distinct groups. The explosion footprints, therefore, provide a unique identifier for each of the proteins. We envision that method could be used concurrently with single particle coherent imaging experiments to provide additional information on shape, mass, or conformation.</description>

      <title>Partial Orientation Retrieval of Proteins From Coulomb Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single Particle Imaging techniques at X-ray lasers have made significant strides, yet the challenge of determining the orientation of freely rotating molecules during delivery remains. In this study, we propose a novel method to partially retrieve the relative orientation of proteins exposed to ultrafast X-ray pulses by analyzing the fragmentation patterns resulting from Coulomb explosions. We simulate these explosions for 45 proteins in the size range 100 -- 4000 atoms using a hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics approach and capture the resulting ion ejection patterns with virtual detectors. Our goal is to exploit information from the explosion to infer orientations of proteins at the time of X-ray exposure. Our results demonstrate that partial orientation information can be extracted, particularly for larger proteins. Our findings can be integrated into existing reconstruction algorithms such as Expand-Maximize-Compress, to improve their efficiency and reduce the need for high-quality diffraction patterns. This method offers a promising avenue for enhancing Single Particle Imaging by leveraging measurable data from the Coulomb explosion to provide valuable insights about orientation.</description>

      <title>Precision Adaptive Hormone Control for Personalized Metastatic Prostate Cancer Treatment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the oncologist acting as the ``game leader'', we employ a Stackelberg game-theoretic model involving multiple populations to study prostate cancer. We refine the drug dosing schedule using an empirical Bayes feed-forward analysis, based on clinical data that reflects each patient's prostate-specific drug response. Our methodology aims for a quantitative grasp of the parameter landscape of this adaptive multi-population model, focusing on arresting the growth of drug-resistant prostate cancer by promoting competition across drug-sensitive cancer cell populations. Our findings indicate that not only is it is feasible to considerably extend cancer suppression duration through careful optimization, but even transform metastatic prostate cancer into a chronic condition instead of an acute one for most patients, with supporting clinical and analytical evidence.</description>

      <title>Characterizing RNA oligomers using Stochastic Titration Constant-pH Metadynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA molecules exhibit various biological functions intrinsically dependent on their diverse ecosystem of highly flexible structures. This flexibility arises from complex hydrogen-bonding networks defined by canonical and non-canonical base pairs that require protonation events to stabilize or perturb these interactions. Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) methods provide a reliable framework to explore the conformational and protonation space of dynamic structures and for robust calculations of pH-dependent properties, such as the pK$_\mathrm{a}$ of titrable sites. Despite growing biological evidence concerning pH regulation of certain motifs and in biotechnological applications, pH-sensitive in silico methods have rarely been applied to nucleic acids. In this work, we extended the stochastic titration CpHMD method to include RNA parameters from the standard $\chi$OL3 AMBER force field and highlighted its capability to depict titration events of nucleotides in single-stranded RNAs. We validated the method using trimers and pentamers with a single central titrable site while integrating a well-tempered metadynamics approach into the st-CpHMD methodology (CpH-MetaD) using PLUMED. This approach enhanced the convergence of the conformational landscape and enabled more efficient sampling of protonation-conformation coupling. Our pK$_\mathrm{a}$ estimates agree with experimental data, validating the method's ability to reproduce electrostatic changes around a titrable nucleobase in single-stranded RNA. These findings provided molecular insight into intramolecular phenomena, such as nucleobase stacking and phosphate interactions, that dictate the experimentally observed pK$_\mathrm{a}$ shifts between different strands. Overall, this work validates both the st-CpHMD and the metadynamics integration as reliable tools for studying biologically relevant RNA systems.</description>

      <title>Role of obstacle softness in the diffusive behavior of active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the diffusive behavior of active Brownian particles in a two-dimensional confined channel filled with soft obstacles, whose softness is controlled by a parameter $K$. Here, active particles are subjected to external bias $F$. Particle diffusion is influenced by entropic barriers that arise due to variations in the shape of the chosen channel geometry. We observed that the interplay between obstacle softness, entropic barriers, and external bias leads to striking transport characteristics of the active particles. For instance, with increasing $F$, the non-linear mobility exhibits non-monotonic behavior, and effective diffusion is greatly enhanced, showing multiple peaks in the presence of soft obstacles. Further, as a function of $K$ and $F$, particles exhibit various diffusive behaviors, e.g., normal diffusion - where the role of obstacles is insignificant, subdiffusion or superdiffusion - where the particles are partially trapped by the obstacles, and particles are ultimately caged by the obstacles. These findings help understand the physical situations wherein active agents diffuse in crowded environments.</description>

      <title>Fluidization and anomalous density fluctuations in epithelial tissues with pulsating activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells not only have self-motility by crawling but are also capable of other types of active motions like periodic contraction or pulsation. In this work, by using the Voronoi cell model, we show how this non-motility activity affects the structure, dynamic and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. We find that random cell pulsation can fluidize solid epithelial tissues, resulting in hyperuniform fluids, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reversed solidification. We prove this solidification is a BKT-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the birth of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation. We propose an unified fluctuating hydrodynamic theory to explain the two very different anomalous density fluctuations phenomena. Our findings can help understanding recent experimental observations in MDCK monolayers.</description>
