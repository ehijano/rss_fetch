      <title>Electron Acceleration in Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wakefield wavelengths associated with solid-state plasmas greatly limit the accelerating length. An alternative approach employs 2D carbon-based nanomaterials, like graphene or carbon nanotubes (CNTs), configured into structured targets. These nanostructures are designed with voids or low-density regions to effectively reduce the overall plasma density. This reduction enables the use of longer-wavelength lasers and also extends the plasma wavelength and the acceleration length. In this study, we present, to our knowledge, the first numerical demonstration of electron acceleration via self-injection into a wakefield bubble driven by an infrared laser pulse in structured CNT targets, similar to the behavior observed in gaseous plasmas for LWFA in the nonlinear (or bubble) regime. Using the PIConGPU code, bundles of CNTs are modeled in a 3D geometry as 25 nm-thick carbon tubes with an initial density of $10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$. The carbon plasma is ionized by a three-cycle, 800 nm wavelength laser pulse with a peak intensity of $10^{21}$ W cm$^{-2}$, achieving an effective plasma density of $10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. The same laser also drives the wakefield bubble, responsible for the electron self-injection and acceleration. Simulation results indicate that fs-long electron bunches with hundreds of pC charge can be self-injected and accelerated at gradients exceeding 1~TeV$/$m. Both charge and accelerating gradient figures are unprecedented when compared with LWFA in gaseous plasma.</description>

      <title>Isolated attosecond free-electron laser based on a sub-cycle driver from hollow capillary fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attosecond light source provides an advanced tool for investigating electron motion using time-resolved-spectroscopy techniques. Isolated attosecond pulses, especially, will significantly advance the study of electron dynamics. However, achieving high-intensity isolated attosecond pulses is still challenging at the present stage. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for generating high-intensity, isolated attosecond soft X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) using a mid-infrared (MIR) sub-cycle modulation laser from gas-filled hollow capillary fibers (HCFs). The multi-cycle MIR pulses are first compressed to sub-cycle using a helium-filled HCF with decreasing pressure gradient due to soliton self-compression effect. By utilizing such sub-cycle MIR laser pulse to modulate the electron beam, we can obtain a quasi-isolated current peak, which can then produce an isolated FEL pulse with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), naturally synchronizing with the sub-cycle MIR laser pulse. Numerical simulations have been carried out, including the sub-cycle pulse generation, electron beam modulation and FEL radiation processes. The simulation results indicate that an isolated attosecond pulse with wavelength of 1 nm, peak power of ~28 GW, pulse duration of ~600 attoseconds and SNR of ~96.4% can be generated by our proposed method. The numerical results demonstrated here pave a new way for generating the high-intensity isolated attosecond soft X-ray pulse, which may have many applications in nonlinear spectroscopy and atomic-site electronic process.</description>

      <title>Influence of nanoparticulates and microgrooves on the secondary electron yield and electrical resistance of laser-treated copper surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser surface structuring has proven to be an effective technique for achieving a copper surface with secondary electron yield (SEY) values close to or below unity. However, the attributes that minimize SEY, such as moderately deep grooves and redeposited nanoparticles, may lead to undesirable consequences, including increased radio frequency surface resistance. This investigation systematically examined data about different cleaning procedures designed to eliminate redeposited adsorbed particulates. Various analysis techniques were used iteratively after each consecutive cleaning step, providing insights into the evolving surface characteristics. The collected experimental results identified distinct impacts of microgrooves, groove orientation, and associated particulates on secondary electron yield and surface resistance. Exposing the crests while retaining high particulate coverage in the grooves leads to reduced SEY values and surface resistance, suggesting that the tips of the grooves exert a more significant influence on surface current density than the groove depth. At the same time, nanoparticles in the grooves have a more significant impact on SEY values than the exposed tips at the surface.</description>

      <title>Cryogenics of a superconducting LINAC : SPIRAL2 from commissioning to operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01196v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SPIRAL2 superconducting linear accelerator (LINAC), which has been operational since 2019, employs superconducting, independently phased RF resonators to deliver a wide range of particle beams. Designed for flexibility in particle types, intensities, and energies, it utilizes superconducting quarter-wave resonators (QWRs), whose performances are critically dependent on the reliability of the cryogenic operation. This paper reviews the evolution from commissioning to the routine operation of the SPIRAL2 cryogenic system, initially commissioned in 2017. It highlights the key challenges encountered, including thermo-acoustic oscillations, thermal management, and abnormal behavior of cavities. Furthermore, it explores the integration of thermodynamic modeling and machine learning techniques to enhance system control and diagnose issues. This work serves as a comprehensive resource for advancing the cryogenic operation and performance of superconducting LINACs.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Surface Resistance of Laser-Treated LHC Beam Screens with the Shielded Pair Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of strong electron clouds in the quadrupole magnetic field regions of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) leads to considerable heating that poses challenges for the cryogenic cooling system, and under certain conditions to proton beam quality deterioration. Research is being conducted on laser-treated inner beam screen surfaces for the upgraded High-Luminosity LHC to mitigate this issue. Laser-induced surface structuring, a technique that effectively roughens surfaces, has been shown to reduce secondary electron emission; an essential factor in controlling electron cloud formation. Conversely, the resulting surface roughening also alters the material's surface impedance, potentially impacting beam stability and increasing beam-induced resistive wall heating. Different laser treatment patterns have been applied to LHC beam screens to estimate this potential impact and assessed for their microwave responses.</description>

      <title>Effects of H$^-$ low beam irradiation and high field pulsing tests in different metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the suitability of a set of different materials for manufacturing of more efficient and durable Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) structures compared to that currently used in many linear particle accelerators, traditionally made out of copper. RFQs are susceptible to vacuum breakdowns caused by the exposure to high electric fields, resulting in surface degradation. Additionally, a further limitation of present-day copper RFQs is surface blistering under hydrogen ion beam exposure, due to beam halo losses. Irradiation is associated with a further reduction of the breakdown field strength of the metal surface thereby affecting the overall efficiency of the RFQ. The investigated materials, Cu-OFE, CuCr1Zr, CuBe2, Ti6Al4V, SS316LN, Nb and Ta, were submitted to low-energy (45 keV) H$^-$ irradiation and tested in a direct-current (DC) system with pulsed high voltage. For comparison, the maximum surface electric field was measured for both irradiated and pristine (non irradiated) surfaces of the same material. The effects of irradiation on the surface of the materials, before and after being submitted to high electric fields, were studied with the help of microscopic imaging and chemical analysis. Blistering caused by H$^-$ irradiation has been observed in all copper and copper alloy materials. Despite reductions in breakdown field strength post-irradiation, no indications were found that the blisters on the surface have a direct cause in triggering breakdowns during high electric field tests. SS316LN, Ti6Al4V, CuBe2 and CuCr1Zr showed maximum surface electric fields higher than copper, making these promising candidate materials for future RFQs manufacturing. This paper focuses on the results with CuCr1Zr, CuBe2, SS316LN and Ta, complementing and expanding previous work exploring Cu-OFE, Nb and Ti6Al4V.</description>

      <title>Polarized electron bunch refresh rates in an electron storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When polarized electron bunches are injected and circulated in a high-energy storage ring, the polarization of the bunches relaxes to the asymptotic value of the radiative polarization, caused by the synchrotron radiation. Hence the bunches must be refreshed periodically, to maintain a predetermined time-averaged value of the bunch polarization. In general, the refresh rates of the "up" and "down" polarization bunches are different. We suggest an alternative policy. We point out that the total bunch refresh rate is almost independent of the asymptotic level of the radiative polarization. We also note that the true goal of so-called "spin matching" is to maximize the buildup time constant (not the asymptotic level) of the radiative polarization. We suggest a scheme to equalize the refresh rates of the "up" and "down" polarization bunches, which may be (i) helpful for accelerator operations, and also (ii) reduce systematic errors in HEP experiments.</description>
