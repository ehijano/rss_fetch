      <title>Helical Ribbons: Simple Chiral Sedimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sedimentation of chiral particles in viscous fluid flow. We identify helical ribbons as simple particles with strong translation-rotation coupling whose symmetry ensures that the centers of mass, buoyancy, resistance, and mobility coincide. Experimental measurements of both relevant mobility tensors show excellent agreement with simulations of ribbons made of interacting spheres. We observe quasi-periodic angular dynamics causing complex spatial trajectories. In tilt-spin phase space, orbits are closed due to time-reversal and reflection symmetry. Changing the helical ribbon length reveals a bifurcation at which the stable sedimentation orientations switch.</description>

      <title>Phonons in stringlet-land and the boson peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid materials that deviate from the harmonic crystal paradigm exhibit characteristic anomalies in the specific heat and vibrational density of states (VDOS) with respect to Debye's theory predictions. The boson peak (BP), a low-frequency excess in the VDOS over Debye law $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is certainly the most famous among them; nevertheless, its origin is still subject of fierce debate. Recent simulation works provided strong evidence that localized one-dimensional string-like excitations (stringlets) might be the microscopic origin of the BP. In this work, we study the dynamics of acoustic phonons interacting with a bath of vibrating 1D stringlets with exponentially distributed size, as observed in simulations. We show that stringlets strongly renormalize the phonon propagator and naturally induce a BP anomaly in the vibrational density of states, corresponding to the emergence of a dispersionless BP flat mode. Additionally, phonon-stringlet interactions produce a strong enhancement of sound attenuation and a dip in the speed of sound near the BP frequency, consistent with experimental and simulation data. The qualitative trends of the BP frequency and intensity are predicted within the model and shown to be in good agreement with previous observations. In summary, our results substantiate with a simple theoretical model the recent simulation results by Hu and Tanaka claiming the origin of the BP from stringlet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bulk condensation by an active interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experiments, supported by mechanically detailed simulations, establishing bulk vapor-liquid condensation of a hard-bead fluid by a tiny population of orientable motile grains that self-assembles into a moving polarized monolayer. In a quasi-1D geometry two such layers, oppositely aligned, immobilize the condensed non-motile component. We account for our observations through a continuum theory with a naturally non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard structure, whose predicted trends as a function of packing fraction are consistent with our observations.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids for which no theory or fundamental understanding is available. We derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier representing a crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula correctly recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are supported by comparisons with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids, which confirm that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Anomalous friction of supercooled glycerol on mica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental understanding of friction of liquids on solid surfaces remains one of the key knowledge gaps in the transport of fluids. While the standard perspective emphasizes the role of wettability and commensurability, recent works have unveiled the crucial role of the solid's internal excitations, whether electronic or phononic, on liquid-solid dissipation. In this work, we take advantage of the considerable variation of the molecular timescales of supercooled glycerol under mild change of temperature, in order to explore how friction depends on the liquid's molecular dynamics. Using a dedicated tuning-fork-based AFM to measure the hydrodynamic slippage of glycerol on mica, we report a 2-order of magnitude increase of the slip length with decreasing temperature by only 30{\deg}C. However the solid-liquid friction coefficient is found to be a non monotonous function of the fluid molecular relaxation rate, f{\alpha}, at odd with an expected Arrhenius behavior. In particular, the linear increase of friction with the liquid molecular rate measured at high temperature cannot be accounted for by existing modelling. We show that this unconventional and non-arrhenian friction is consistent with a contribution of the solid's phonons to the liquid-solid friction. This dynamical friction opens new perspectives to control hydrodynamic flows by properly engineering phononic and electronic excitation spectra in channel walls.</description>

      <title>Structure and thermodynamics of supported lipid membranes on hydrophobic van der Waals surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the adsorption and physical characteristics of supported lipid membranes is crucial for their effective use as model cell membranes. Their morphological and thermodynamic properties at the nanoscale have traditionally been studied on hydrophilic substrates, such as mica and silicon oxide, which have proved to facilitate the reconstruction of biomembranes. However, in more recent years, with the advent of the van der Waals crystals technology, two-dimensional crystals such as graphene have been proposed as potential substrates in biosensing devices. Membranes formed on these crystals are expected to behave differently owing to their intrinsic hydrophobicity, however thus far knowledge of their morphological and thermodynamic properties is lacking. Here we present a comprehensive nanoscale analysis of the adsorption of phosphatidylcholine lipid monolayers on two of the most commonly used van der Waals crystals, graphite and hexagonal boron nitride. Both morphological and thermodynamic properties of the lipid membranes were investigated using temperature-controlled atomic force microscopy. Our experiments show that the lipids adsorb onto the crystals, forming monolayers with their orientation dependent upon their concentration. Furthermore, we found that the hydrophobicity of van der Waals crystals determines a strong increase in the transition temperature of the lipid monolayer compared to that observed on hydrophilic substrates. These results are important for understanding the properties of lipid membranes at solid surfaces and extending their use to novel drug delivery and biosensing devices made of van der Waals crystals.</description>

      <title>Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 1: identifying the rate-limiting physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple nations are planning activity on the Moon's surface, and to deconflict lunar operations we must understand the sandblasting damage from rocket exhaust blowing soil. Prior research disagreed over the scaling of the erosion rate, which determines the magnitude of the damage. Reduced gravity experiments and two other lines of evidence now indicate that the erosion rate scales with the kinetic energy flux at the bottom of the laminar sublayer of the gas. Because the rocket exhaust is so fast, eroded particles lifted higher in the boundary layer do not impact the surface for kilometers (if at all; some leave the Moon entirely), so there is no saltation in the vicinity of the gas. As a result, there is little transport of gas kinetic energy from higher in the boundary layer down to the surface, so the emission of soil into the gas is a surprisingly low energy process. In low lunar gravity, a dominant source of resistance to this small energy flux turns out to be the cohesive energy density of the lunar soil, which arises primarily from particles in the 0.3 to 3 micron size range. These particles constitute only a tiny fraction of the mass of lunar soil and have been largely ignored in most studies, so they are poorly characterized.</description>

      <title>Aftershocks as a time independant phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequences of aftershocks following Omori's empirical law are observed after most major earthquakes, as well as in laboratory-scale fault-mimicking experiments. Nevertheless, the origin of this memory effect is still unclear. In this letter, we present an analytical framework for treating labquake and earthquake catalogs on an equal footing. Using this analysis method, we show that when memory is considered to be in deformation and not in time, all data collapse onto a single master curve, showing that the timescale is entirely fixed by the inverse of the strain rate.</description>

      <title>Slow fatigue and highly delayed yielding via shear banding in oscillatory shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically the dynamical process of yielding in cyclically sheared amorphous materials, within a thermal elastoplastic model and the soft glassy rheology model. Within both models we find an initially slow accumulation, over many cycles after the inception of shear, of low levels of damage in the form strain heterogeneity across the sample. This slow fatigue then suddenly gives way to catastrophic yielding and material failure. Strong strain localisation in the form of shear banding is key to the failure mechanism. We characterise in detail the dependence of the number of cycles N* before failure on the amplitude of imposed strain, the working temperature, and the degree to which the sample is annealed prior to shear. We discuss our finding with reference to existing experiments and particle simulations, and suggest new ones to test our predictions.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic wetting: Cox-Voinov theory with normal stress effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Cox-Voinov theory of contact line motion provides a relation between the macroscopically observable contact angle, and the microscopic wetting angle as a function of contact line velocity. Here we investigate how viscoelasticity, specifically the normal stress effect, modifies wetting dynamics. Using the thin film equation for the second-order fluid, it is found that the normal stress effect is dominant at small scales. We show that the effect can be incorporated in the Cox-Voinov theory through an apparent microscopic angle, which differs from the true microscopic angle. The theory is applied to the classical problems of drop spreading and dip-coating, which shows how normal stress facilitates (inhibits) the motion of advancing (receding) contact lines. For rapid advancing motion, the apparent microscopic angle can tend to zero in which case the dynamics is described by a new regime that was already anticipated in Boudaoud (2007).</description>
