      <title>Dynamically emergent correlations in a Brownian gas with diffusing diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a gas of $N$ Brownian particles in the presence of a common stochastic diffusivity $D(t)=B^2(t)$, where $B(t)$ represents a one-dimensional Brownian motion at time $t$. Starting with all the particles from the origin, the gas expands ballistically. We show that because of the common stochastic diffusivity, the expanding gas gets dynamically correlated, and the joint probability density function of the position of the particles has a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure that was recently found in several other systems. The special CIID structure allows us to compute the average density profile of the gas, extreme and order statistics, gap distribution between successive particles, and the full counting statistics (FCS) that describes the probability density function (PDF) $H(\kappa, t)$ of the fraction of particles $\kappa$ in a given region $[-L,L]$. Interestingly, the position fluctuation of the central particles and the average density profiles are described by the same scaling function. The PDF describing the FCS has an essential singularity near $\kappa=0$, indicating the presence of particles inside the box $[-L,L]$ at all times. Near the upper limit $\kappa =1$, the scaling function $H(\kappa,t)$ has a rather unusual behavior: $H(\kappa,t)\sim (1-\kappa)^{\beta(t)}$ where the exponent $\beta(t)$ changes continuously with time. While at early times $\beta(t)&lt;0$ indicating a divergence of $H(\kappa,t)$ as $\kappa\to 1$, $\beta(t)$ becomes positive for $t&gt;t_c$ where $t_c$ is computed exactly. For $t&gt;t_c$, the scaling function $H(\kappa,t)$ vanishes as $\kappa\to 1$, indicating that it is highly unlikely to have all the particles in the interval $[-L,L]$. Exactly at $t=t_c$, $\beta=0$, indicating that the PDF approaches a non-zero constant as $\kappa\to 1$. Thus, as a function of $t$, the FCS exhibits an interesting shape transition.</description>

      <title>Influence and information in a collective of self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While information-theoretic quantities, such as transfer entropy, have been widely adopted to infer causal relationships in collective systems, a critical gap exists: the absence of quantitative evidence directly linking information-theoretic quantities to a physically defined influence. This letter addresses this gap by proposing a modified Vicsek model that enables the calculation of a physically interpretable influence grounded in the angular interactions between particles. Averaged pairwise influences can serve as new order parameters to indicate collective phase transitions. We reveal quantitative relations between information, represented by transfer entropy, and average influence in pairwise and collective interactions. We test three typical methods of partial information decomposition and find that the method based on intrinsic mutual information gives the most appropriate interpretation. Overall, this work provides a model system for quantitative studies of influence and information in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular motion at the experimental glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to study numerically the glass transition of molecular fluids. Our approach combines the construction of simple yet realistic models with the development of Monte Carlo algorithms to accelerate equilibration and sampling. Inspired by the well-studied ortho-terphenyl glass-former, we construct a molecular model with an analogous triangular geometry and construct a `flip' Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate that the flip Monte Carlo algorithm achieves a sampling speedup of about $10^9$ at the experimental glass transition temperature $T_g$. This allows us to systematically analyze the equilibrium structure and molecular dynamics of the model over a temperature regime previously inaccessible. We carefully compare the observed physical behavior to earlier studies that used atomistic models. In particular, we find that the glass fragility and the departure from the Stokes-Einstein relation are much closer to experimental observations. We characterize the development and temperature evolution of spatial correlations in the relaxation dynamics, using both orientational and translational degrees of freedom. Excess wings emerge at intermediate frequencies in dynamic rotational spectra, and we directly visualize the corresponding molecular motion near $T_g$. Our approach can be generalized to a number of molecular geometries and paves the way to a complete understanding of how molecular details may affect more universal physical aspects characterizing molecular liquids approaching their glass transition.</description>

      <title>Nonideal Statistical Field Theory at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a field theory capable of describing the critical properties of nonideal systems undergoing continuous phase transitions beyond the leading order radiative corrections or in the number of loops (effective field theories limited only to leading order were recently defined in literature). These systems present defects, inhomogeneities and impurities as opposed to ideal ones which are perfect, homogeneous and pure. We compute the values of the critical exponents of the theory beyond leading order and compare with their corresponding experimental measured results. The results show some interplay between nonideal effects and fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry breaking in 1D spin chains and 1+1D field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that ground states of 1D spin chains can spontaneously break U(1) ``easy-plane'' spin rotation symmetry, via true long-range order of $(S^x, S^y)$, at the phase transition between two quasi-long-range-ordered phases. The critical point can be reached by tuning a single parameter in a Hamiltonian with the same symmetry as the XXZ model, without further fine-tuning. Equivalently, it can arise in systems of bosons with particle-hole symmetry, as a long-range-ordered transition point between two quasi-long-range-ordered superfluids. Our approach is to start with the continuum field theory of the isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet and consider generic perturbations that respect easy-plane symmetry. We argue for a renormalization-group flow to a critical point where long-range order in $(S^x, S^y)$ is enabled by coexisting critical fluctuations of $S^z$. (We also discuss multicritical points where further parameters are tuned to zero.) These results show that it is much easier to break continuous symmetries in 1D than standard lore would suggest. The failure of standard intuition for 1D chains (based on the quantum--classical correspondence) can be attributed to Berry phases, which prevent the 1+1D system from mapping to a classical 2D spin model. The present theory also gives an example of an ordered state whose Goldstone mode is interacting even in the infra-red, rather than becoming a free field.</description>

      <title>Beyond one-loop: higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} &lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f &gt; N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Hybrid thermalization in the large $N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature.
  We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble. Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.</description>

      <title>Variational simulation of quantum phase transitions induced by boundary fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the system.</description>

      <title>Static Contact Angles of Mixtures: Classical Density Functional Theory and Experimental Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work assesses a classical density functional theory (DFT) model for predicting macroscopic static contact angles of pure substances and mixtures by comparison to own experimental data. We employ a DFT with a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) for the fluid-fluid interactions and an effective external potential for the solid-fluid interactions. The solid substrate is characterized by adjusting a single solid-solid interaction energy parameter to a single contact angle value of $n$-octane, while all other results are predictions based on Berthelot-Lorentz combining rules. The surface tensions between solid, liquid and vapor phases are determined from one-dimensional DFT calculations, and Young's equation is used to calculate the contact angle. A non-polar polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon) substrate is used, and experiments are carried out using the sessile droplet method with graphical evaluation of the contact angle. Accurate results are obtained for pure substances except for monohydric alcohols. Contact angles for monohydric alcohols are systematically overestimated, and we show that this is partially due to neglecting orientational effects. The approach provides accurate results for mixtures whenever the respective pure substance contact angle is described well. This comprises mixtures of non-polar, polar, and hydrogen bonding substances, including mixtures with water. Our results suggest that DFT based on PC-SAFT provides a fast and accurate method for prediction of contact angles for a wide range of pure substances and mixtures.</description>

      <title>Theory of the Anderson transition in three-dimensional chiral symmetry classes: Connection to type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions governed by topological defects constitute a cornerstone of modern physics. Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional (3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an external magnetic field, respectively.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Many-body Dynamics with Projected Ensembles on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer a new opportunity for the experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics, which have traditionally been characterized through expectation values or entanglement measures, based on density matrices of the system. Recently, a more general framework for studying quantum many-body systems based on projected ensembles has been introduced, revealing novel quantum phenomena, such as deep thermalization in chaotic systems. Here, we experimentally investigate a chaotic quantum many-body system using projected ensembles on a superconducting processor with 16 qubits on a square lattice. Our results provide direct evidence of deep thermalization by observing a Haar-distributed projected ensemble for the steady states within a charge-conserved sector. Moreover, by introducing an ensemble-averaged entropy as a metric, we establish a benchmark for many-body information leakage from the system to its environment. Our work paves the way for studying quantum many-body dynamics using projected ensembles and shows a potential implication for advancing quantum simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Complexity of PXP scars revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a quantum quench scenario in which either a scarring or thermalizing initial state evolves under the PXP Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we study the time evolution of spread complexity and related quantities in the Krylov basis. We find that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, as functions of the iteration number $n$, exhibit a characteristic arched growth and decay, followed by erratic oscillations which we refer to as buttress. The arched profile predominantly arises from contributions within the quantum many-body scar subspace, while the buttress is linked to thermalization dynamics. To explain this behavior, we utilize the representation theory of $\mathfrak{s}l_3(\mathbb{C})$, allowing us to decompose the PXP Hamiltonian into a linear component and a residual part. The linear term governs the formation and width of the arch, and we observe that that there exists a threshold of arch width which determines whether a given initial state exhibits scarring. Meanwhile, the residual term accounts qualitatively for the emergence of the buttress. We estimate an upper bound for the extent of the buttress using Lucas numbers. Finally, we demonstrate that spread complexity oscillates periodically over time for scarred initial states, whereas such oscillations are suppressed in thermalizing cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks: First Hitting Times with Weak Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first detected recurrence time problem of continuous-time quantum walks on graphs. While previous works have employed projective measurements to determine the first return time, we implement a protocol based on weak measurements on a dilated system, enabling minimally invasive monitoring throughout the evolution. To achieve this, we extend the theoretical framework and complement it with both numerical simulations and experimental investigations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite the implementation of a generalized measurement, our modified formalism of weak recurrence provides a description purely within the Hilbert space of the quantum system. Our results reveal that the first hitting time scales inversely with the coupling parameter between the ancilla and the quantum system.</description>

      <title>Ambiguities, Built-in Biases and Flaws in Big Data Insight Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I address the challenge of extracting reliable insights from large datasets using a simplified model that illustrates how hierarchical classification can distort outcomes. The model consists of discrete pixels labeled red, blue, or white. Red and blue indicate distinct properties, and white represents unclassified or ambiguous data. A macro-color is assigned only if one color holds a strict majority among the pixels. Otherwise, the aggregate is labeled white, reflecting uncertainty. This setup mimics a percolation threshold at fifty percent. Assuming direct access of the various proportions of colors is infeasible from the data, I implement a hierarchical coarse-graining procedure. Elements (first pixels, then aggregates) are recursively grouped and reclassified via local majority rules, producing ultimately a single super-aggregate whose color represents the inferred macro-property of the collection of pixels as a whole. Analytical results, supported by simulations, show that the process introduces additional white aggregates beyond white pixels, which could be initially present. These arise from groups lacking a clear majority, requiring arbitrary symmetry-breaking decisions to attribute a color to them. While each local resolution may appear minor and inconsequential, their repetitions introduce a growing systematic bias. Even with complete data, unavoidable asymmetries in local rules are shown to skew outcomes. This study highlights a critical limitation of recursive data reduction. Insight extraction is shaped not only by data quality, but by how local ambiguity is handled. That results in built-in biases. Thus, the related flaws are not due to the data, but due to structural choices made during local aggregations. Though based on a simple model, the findings expose the high likelihood of inherent flaws in widely used hierarchical classification techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal state preparation for near-term quantum processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparation of quantum thermal states of many-body systems is a key computational challenge for quantum processors, with applications in physics, chemistry, and classical optimization. We provide a simple and efficient algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point $\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma -\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition. Our algorithm provides a path to efficient quantum simulation of quantum-correlated states at finite temperature with current and near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Time Formalism for Causal Nonlinear Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that causal linear response functions can be found by computing the much simpler imaginary time-ordered Matsubara functions and performing an analytic continuation. This principle is the basis for much of our understanding of linear response for interacting and disordered systems, via diagrammatic perturbation theory. Similar imaginary-time approaches have recently been introduced for computing nonlinear response functions as well, although the rigorous connection between Matsubara and causal nonlinear response functions has not been clearly elucidated. In this work, we provide a proof of this connection to all orders in perturbation theory. Using an equations of motion approach, we show by induction that casual nonlinear response functions at every order can be obtained from an analytic continuation of an appropriate time-ordered Matsubara function. We demonstrate this connection explicitly for second order response functions in the Lehmann representation. As a byproduct of our approach, we derive an explicit expression for the Lehmann representation of $n$-th order response functions by solving the equations of motion. We also use our result to find an analytic spectral density representation for both causal response functions and Matsubara functions. Finally, we show how our results lead to a family of generalized sum rules, focusing explicitly on the asymptotic expression for $n$-th harmonic generation rate.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>A computation of the covariance between two linear statistics for the Jellium model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend previous results providing an exact formula for the variance of a linear statistic for the Jellium model, a one-dimensional model of Statistical mechanics obtained from the $k \longrightarrow 0^{+}$ limit of the Dyson log-gas. For such a computation of the covariance, in comparison to previous work for computations of the log-gas covariance, we obtain a formula between two linear statistics, given arbitrary functions $f$ and $g$ over the real line, that is dependent upon an asymptotic approximation of the Jellium probability distribution function from large $N$ deviations, and from an effective saddle-point action.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Circuits: Modeling chemical reaction networks with nonequilibrium conductance matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the nonequilibrium conductance matrix for open stationary Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) described by a deterministic mass action kinetic equation. As an illustration, we determine the nonequilibrium conductance matrix of a CRN made of two pseudo-linear sub-networks, called chemical modules, in two different ways: First by computing the nonequilibrium conductances of the modules that are then serially connected. Second by computing the nonequilibrium conductance of the CRN directly. The two approaches coincide, as expected from our theory of thermodynamic circuits.</description>

      <title>Towards neural reinforcement learning for large deviations in nonequilibrium systems with memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning method for a class of non-Markov systems; our approach extends the actor-critic framework given by Rose et al. [New J. Phys. 23 013013 (2021)] for obtaining scaled cumulant generating functions characterizing the fluctuations. The actor-critic is implemented using neural networks; a particular innovation in our method is the use of an additional neural policy for processing memory variables. We demonstrate results for current fluctuations in various memory-dependent models with special focus on semi-Markov systems where the dynamics is controlled by nonexponential interevent waiting time distributions.</description>

      <title>Boundary effects in classical liquid density fluctuations at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate thermal effects on density fluctuations in confined classical liquids using phonon quantization. The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the mean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities including Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies distinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting characteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a high-temperature classical regime where $\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as expected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\hbar\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem. Numerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic temperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum and classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B T \sim \hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is the sound velocity.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>

      <title>A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density that is continuous at high tumble rates but exhibits divergences at low ones. This key feature, known as shape transition, constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (diverging density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points at which the density diverges correspond to the configurations where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional PDMPs.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of the Ising Model on a 3-Dimensional Fractal Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical behavior of the classical Ising model on a three-dimensional fractal lattice with Hausdorff dimension $d_H = \ln32 / \ln4 = 2.5$ is investigated using the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) method. We determine the critical temperature $T_c \approx 2.65231$ and the critical exponents for magnetization $\beta \approx 0.059$ and field response $\delta \approx 35$. Unlike a previously studied 2D fractal with $d_H \approx 1.792$, the specific heat for this 3D fractal exhibits a divergent singularity at $T_c$. The results are compared with those for regular lattices and other fractal structures to elucidate the role of dimensionality in critical phenomena.</description>
