      <title>Emergent Universe in f(Q) gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One resolution of the ancient cosmic singularity, i.e., the Big Bang Singularity (BBS), is to assume an inflationary stage preceded by a long enough static state in which the universe and its physical properties would oscillate around certain equilibrium points. The early period is referred to as the Einstein Static (ES) Universe phase, which characterizes a static phase with positive spatial curvature. A stable Einstein static state can serve as a substitute for BBS, followed by an inflationary period known as the Emergent Scenario. The initial need has not been fulfilled within the context of General Relativity, prompting the investigation of modified theories of gravity. The current research aims to find such a solution within the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity, specifically in the trendy $f(Q)$ theories. An analysis has been conducted to investigate stable solutions for both positively and negatively curved spatial FRW universes, in the presence of a perfect fluid, by utilizing various torsion-free and curvature-free affine connections. Additionally, we propose a method to facilitate an exit from a stable ES to a subsequent inflationary phase. We demonstrate that $f(Q)$ gravity theories have the ability to accurately depict the emergence of the universe.</description>

      <title>Analogy of space-time as an elastic medium, estimation creep coefficient of space from MOND theory, gravitational lensing and via time data from the GPS effect, discussion of the results for dark matter and Einstein's field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After recalling the principles that allow space-time to be considered by analogy as an elastic medium, we show how the modified gravity according to the MOND theory concerning the anomaly of the velocities of stars at the periphery of galaxies can be seen as a creep of space acting on the radius of galaxies that gives a creep coefficient of Phi(space) = ((a0/a) x (Ro local/ Ro mean) -1). The values vary between 0.2 and 9 depending on the type of galaxy and density distribution. Considering the gravitational lensing effect of the ball cluster we obtain a creep coefficient Phi (space) = (1-pv)/pv. With pv the percentage of visible matter and pDM the percentage of Dark matter from the global mass (pv + pDM =1). The values vary between 0.66 and 4 for this cluster. This paper therefore raises the question, via these creep coefficients, of the possible granular nature of the vacuum and therefore of space fabric on the one hand and proposes another dark matter-free approach based on the creep of the texture of space to explain gravitational anomalies on the other hand.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent Regge-Wheeler Potential and QNMs in Quantum Corrected AdS Black Hole with Phantom Global Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geodesic motion of test particles in the spacetime surrounding a static, spherically symmetric black hole, which is described by an AdS-Schwarzschild-like metric and incorporates a quantum correction. This black hole also features phantom global monopoles, which modify the structure of the black hole space-time. We begin by deriving the effective potential governing the motion of test particles in this system and carefully analyze the impact of quantum correction in the presence of both phantom and ordinary global monopoles. Furthermore, we extend our study to include the spin-dependent Regge-Wheeler (RW) potential, which characterizes the dynamics of perturbations in this quantum-corrected black hole background. By examining this RW potential for various spin fields, we show how quantum corrections affect its form in the presence of both phantom and ordinary global monopoles. Our analysis demonstrate that quantum correction significantly alter the nature of the RW-potential, influencing the stability, and behavior of test particles and perturbations around the black hole.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference for individual binaries and a stochastic background with Pulsar Timing Array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of pulsar timing array data has provided evidence for a gravitational wave background in the NanoHertz band. This raises the question of what is the source of the signal, is it astrophysical or cosmological in origin? If the signal originates from a population of supermassive black hole binaries, as is generally assumed, we can expect to see evidence for both anisotropy and to be able to resolve signals from individual binaries as more data are collected. The anisotropy and resolvable systems are caused by a small number of loud signals that stand out from the crowd. Here we focus on the joint detection of individual signals and a stochastic background. While methods have previously been developed to perform such an analysis, they are currently held back by the cost of computing the joint likelihood function. Each individual source is described by $N=8+2N_p$ parameters, where $N_p$ are the number of pulsars in the array. With the latest combined data sets having over one hundred pulsars, the parameter space is very large, and consequently, it takes a large number of likelihood evaluations to explore these models. Here we present a new approach that extends the Fourier basis method, previously introduced to accelerate analyses for stochastic signals, to also include deterministic signals. Key elements of the method are that the likelihood evaluations are per-pulsar, avoiding expensive operations on large matrices, and the templates for individual binaries can be computed analytically or using fast Fourier methods on a sparsely sampled grid of time samples. The net result is an analysis that is orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of Morris-Thorne wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the fact that, for a broad class of Morris-Thorne wormholes, the maximum of the effective potential is located at the throat, we derive accurate analytic WKB expressions for the quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of various traversable wormholes. In the eikonal limit, these analytic expressions acquire a compact form and satisfy the correspondence between the quasinormal modes and the radii of the wormhole shadows.</description>

      <title>Dual relativity and its cosmological consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new version of the modified theory of gravity is formulated in which two physical metrics are constructed out of two vierbeins connected with each other by the duality condition including the flat metric of the prior geometry. The duality condition plays a crucial role in this theoretical scheme, and thus gives the name to the whole approach: the theory of dual relativity (TDR). The energy-momentum tensor density of a closed system is defined, and the conservation law for this tensor density is deduced. In the TDR it is assumed that there exist two kinds of matter governed by the mutually dual physical metrics, and it is shown that the interaction between them has antigravitational character. A cosmological limit of the field equations of the TDR is considered. In this limit, there are two types of solutions: with positive and with negative energy density. The first type admits the existence of a stable Universe as a whole. The second type gives the oscillations of the cosmological scale factor within the finite limits excluding the zero point, that can be treated as a solution for a certain domain of the Universe. For this type of solutions, the model formula for the dependence of the Hubble parameter $H$ on the redshift $z$ has been obtained. The values of the parameters of this formula are found from the fit to the available $H(z)$ data. It is obtained that the TDR gives a better description of the $H(z)$ data as compared to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The important consequences of the obtained results are, first, their incompatibility with the standard Big Bang model and, second, the existence of two critical values of the scale factor determining the points of its sharp change in the course of oscillations in the solutions of the second type.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formation of axionic hair around charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a nonlinear numerical investigation on the dynamical scalarization process of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, incorporating an axionic scalar potential within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. By scrutinizing the evolution of the irreducible mass of the black hole and the value of scalar field on the apparent horizon across various parameters of the axionic potential, we elucidate the correlations between the final states of scalarized charged black hole and the axionic potential. We observe that the inclusion of the axionic potential can either decrease or increase the irreducible mass of the final scalarized black hole, depending on the strength of the coupling between the dilation and the electric invariant $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. Regarding the value of the scalar field on the apparent horizon, we find that it decreases with the inclusion of the axionic potential. Our results contribute to an important understanding of the dynamical scalarization of black holes and the potential configurations of scalar hair with various self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars with a dark-energy core from the Chaplygin gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of a Chaplygin dark fluid (CDF) core on neutron stars (NSs). To address this study, we focus on the relativistic structure of stellar configurations composed by a dark-energy core, described by a Chaplygin-like equation of state (EoS), and an ordinary-matter crust which is described by a polytropic EoS. We examine the impact of the rate of energy densities at the discontinuous surface, defined as $\alpha= \rho_{\rm dis}^-/\rho_{\rm dis}^+$, on the radius, total gravitational mass, oscillation spectrum and tidal deformability. Furthermore, we compare our theoretical predictions with several observational mass-radius measurements and tidal deformability constraints. These comparisons together with the radial stability analysis show that the existence of NSs with a dark-energy core is possible.</description>

      <title>Non-locality in Quadrupolar Gravitational Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity suffers for two main problems which have not yet been overcome: it predicts spacetime singularities and cannot be formulated as a perturbative renormalizable theory. In particular, many attempts have been made for avoiding singularities, such as considering higher order or infinite derivative theories. The price to pay in both cases is to give up locality and therefore they are known altogether as non-local theories of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how to recognize the presence of non-local effects by exploiting the power emitted by gravitational waves in a binary system in presence of non-local corrections as $R\Box^{-1}R$ to the Hilbert-Einstein action. After solving the field equations in terms of the source stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ and obtaining the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor, $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, we find that the General Relativity quadrupole formula is modified in a non-trivial way, making it feasible to find a possible signature of non-locality. Our final results on the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor could also be applied to several astrophysical scenarios involving energy or momentum loss, potentially providing multiple tests for non-local deviations from General Relativity. We finally discuss the detectability of the massless transverse scalar mode, discovering that, although this radiation is extremely weak, in a small range around the model divergence, its amplitude could fall within the low-frequency Einstein Telescope sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Shadow and other Observables away from the Horizon: Extending the Effective Metric Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work we have developed a model-independent, effective description of quantum deformed, spherically symmetric and static black holes in four dimensions. The deformations of the metric are captured by two functions of the physical distance to the horizon, which are provided in the form of self-consistent Taylor series expansions. While this approach efficiently captures physical observables in the immediate vicinity of the horizon, it is expected to encounter problems of convergence at further distances. Therefore, we demonstrate in this paper how to use Pad\'e approximants to extend the range of applicability of this framework. We provide explicit approximations of physical observables that depend on finitely many effective parameters of the deformed black hole geometry, depending on the order of the Pad\'e approximant. By taking the asymptotic limit of this order, we in particular provide a closed-form expression for the black hole shadow of the (fully) deformed geometry, which captures the leading quantum corrections. We illustrate our results for a number of quantum black holes previously proposed in the literature and find that our effective approach provides excellent approximations in all cases.</description>

      <title>Black holes and their shadows in $F(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radii of the photon sphere and the black hole shadow in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity. For this purpose, we derive the field equation for the corresponding theory when the general spherically symmetric and static configuration is considered. This equation is the third-order differential equation with respect to $F_R(r)\equiv \left. \frac{dF(R)}{dR}\right|_{R=R(r)}$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. Solving the equation, we find $F(R)$ as a function of $r$, $F_R=F_R(r)$. By using the assumed and obtained geometry, one can calculate the scalar curvature $R$ as a function of $r$, $R=R(r)$, which could be solved with respect to $r$ as $r=r(R)$. Then one finds the functional form of $F_R$ as a function of the scalar curvature $R$, $F_R=F_R(R)=F_R\left( r=r\left(R\right)\right)$.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantization in FLRW geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of deformation quantization to the system of a free particle evolving within a universe described by a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry. This approach allows us to analyze the dynamics of classical and quantum phase-space distributions in curved spacetime. We demonstrate that when the curvature of the spatial sections is non-zero, the classical Liouville equation and its quantum counterpart, represented by the Moyal equation, exhibit distinct behaviors. Specifically, we derive a semi-classical dynamical equation that incorporates curvature effects and analyze the evolution of the Wigner quasi-distribution function in this cosmological context. By employing a perturbative approach, we elaborate on the case of a particle described by a spherically symmetric Wigner distribution and explore the implications for phase-space dynamics in expanding universes. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between quantum mechanics, phase-space formulations, and cosmological expansion, highlighting the importance of deformation quantization techniques for understanding quantum systems in curved spacetime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity is conventionally formulated in terms of the Einstein-Hilbert-York-Gibbons-Hawking action, which requires suitable subtractions to produce the correct black hole partition function. However, there is a unique, canonical teleparallel reformulation which reproduces the same results without subtractions or other ambiguities. This is verified in the case of a black hole with or without an electric or a magnetic charge and in a background with or without a cosmological constant. Further, it is conjectured that the results may be improved in a local prescription which reduces the canonical teleparallel action to a surface integral over the horizon</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave astronomy and the expansion history of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The timeline of the expansion rate ultimately defines the interplay between high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The guiding theme of this topical review is provided by the scrutiny of the early history of the space-time curvature through the diffuse backgrounds of gravitational radiation that are sensitive to all the stages of the evolution of the plasma. Due to their broad spectrum (extending from the aHz region to the THz domain) they bridge the macroworld described by general relativity and the microworld of the fundamental constituents of matter. It is argued that during the next score year the analysis of the relic gravitons may infirm or confirm the current paradigm where a radiation plasma is assumed to dominate the whole post-inflationary epoch. The role of high frequency and ultra-high frequency signals between the MHz and the THz is emphasized in the perspective of quantum sensing. The multiparticle final state of the relic gravitons and its macroscopic quantumness is also discussed with particular attention to the interplay between the entanglement entropy and the maximal frequency of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Immirzi parameter: Landauer's principle and alternative entropy frameworks in Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the implications from area quantization in Loop Quantum Gravity, particularly focusing on the application of the Landauer principle -- a fundamental thermodynamic concept establishing a connection between information theory and thermodynamics. By leveraging the Landauer principle in conjunction with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law, we derive the usual value for the Immirzi parameter precisely, $\gamma = \ln2/(\pi \sqrt{3})$, without using the typical procedure that involves the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. Furthermore, following an analogous procedure, we derive a modified expression for the Immirzi parameter aligned with Barrow's entropy formulation. Our analysis also yields a new expression for the Immirzi parameter consistent with a corresponding modified Kaniadakis entropy for black hole entropy further illustrating, along with Barrow's entropy, the applicability of Landauer's principle in alternative statistical contexts within black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Clausius inequalities and entanglement production in holographic two-dimensional CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing quantum information theory, it has been shown that irreversible entropy production is bounded from both below and above in physical processes. Both these bounds are positive and generalize the Clausius inequality. Such bounds are, however, obtained from distance measures in the space of states, which are hard to define and compute in quantum field theories. We show that the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) can be utilized to obtain both lower and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production for quenches leading to transitions between thermal states carrying uniform momentum density in two dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We achieve this by refining earlier methods and developing an algebraic procedure for determining HRT surfaces in arbitrary Ba\~nados-Vaidya geometries which are dual to quenches involving transitions between general quantum equilibrium states (e.g. thermal states) where the QNEC is saturated. We also discuss results for the growth and thermalization of entanglement entropy for arbitrary initial and final temperatures and momentum densities. The rate of quadratic growth of entanglement just after the quench depends only on the change in the energy density and is independent of the entangling length. For sufficiently large entangling lengths, the entanglement tsunami phenomenon can be established. Finally, we study recovery of the initial state from the evolving entanglement entropy and argue that the Renyi entropies should give us a refined understanding of scrambling of quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximal supergravities in ten and eleven dimensions admit consistent truncations on particular spheres to maximal supergravities in lower dimensions. Concurrently, the truncation to singlets under any subgroup of the sphere isometry group leads to consistent truncations with less or no supersymmetry. We review the relation between these truncations in the framework of exceptional field theory. As an application, we derive three new G$_2$-invariant solutions of $D=11$ supergravity. Their geometry is of the form AdS$_4\times \Sigma_7$ where $\Sigma_7$ is a deformed seven-sphere, preserving SO(7) isometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) we study the core formation in the presence of an Ideal Gas (IG). Our analysis is based on the solution of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson-Euler system of equations that drives the evolution of FDM together with a compressible IG, both coupled through the gravitational potential they produce. Starting from random initial conditions for both FDM and IG, with dominant FDM, we study the evolution of the system until it forms a nearly relaxed, virialized and close to hydrostatic equilibrium core, surrounded by an envelope of the two components. We find that the core corresponds to Newtonian Fermion-Boson Stars (FBS). If the IG is used to model luminous matter, our results indicate that FBS behave as attractor core solutions of structure formation of FDM along with baryonic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing reliable quantum links between a network of satellites and ground stations is a crucial step towards realizing a wide range of satellite-based quantum protocols, including global quantum networks, distributed sensing, quantum key distribution, and quantum clock synchronization. In this article, we envision a network of satellites and ground stations where quantum links are created through the exchange of entangled photon pairs. We simulate the dynamics of a satellite constellation and a set of Bell tests between the constellation and ground stations. We identify the regions on Earth where Bell tests can be successfully conducted with a satellite or a set of them, at a specified level of confidence. These regions move with the constellation and will be referred to as "Bell violation shadows". We demonstrate that these shadows provide valuable insights for the study and evaluation of many satellite-mediated or satellite-assisted quantum protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general the speed of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in Scalar-Tensor modifications of Einstein's gravity is different from the speed of Light. Nevertheless, it has been measured that their speeds are nearly the same. For the most general Scalar-Tensor theories classified to date that do propagate a graviton -- DHOST, including Horndeski and Beyond Horndeski (BH) theories -- we show that, remarkably, up to 5 self-consistent couplings of the scalar of Dark Energy (DE) to the Photon are enough to make their GWs luminal in a wide set of cases. There is at least a Luminal BH theory for which the GW decay into DE is suppressed in any cosmological background.</description>

      <title>Testing local position invariance with odd multipoles of galaxy clustering statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological constraints on local position invariance (LPI), a key aspect of the Einstein equivalence principle (EEP), through asymmetric galaxy clustering. The LPI asserts that the outcomes of the non-gravitational experiments are identical regardless of location in spacetime and has been tested through measurements of the gravitational redshift effect. Therefore, measuring the gravitational redshift effect encoded in galaxy clustering provides a powerful and novel cosmological probe of the LPI. Recent work by Saga et al. proposed its validation using the cross-correlation function between distinct galaxy samples, but their analysis focused solely on the dipole moment. In this paper, we extend their work by further analyzing a higher-order odd multipole moment, the octupole moment, in the constraints on the LPI-violating parameter, $\alpha$, expected from galaxy surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, Euclid space telescope, Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph, and Square Kilometre Array. We demonstrate that combining the octupole and dipole moments significantly improves the constraints, particularly when the analysis is restricted to larger scales, characterized by a large minimum separation $s_{\rm min}$. For a conservative setup with $s_{\rm min}=15 {\rm Mpc}/h$, we find an average improvement of 11$\%$ compared to using the dipole moment alone. Our results highlight the importance of higher-order multipoles in constraining $\alpha$, providing a more robust approach to testing the EEP on cosmological scales.</description>

Abstract: We study the electron-positron to muon--anti-muon cross-section in the asymptotically safe Standard Model. In particular, we include the graviton contributions to the scattering amplitude, which is computed from momentum-dependent time-like one-particle-irreducible correlation functions. Specifically, we employ reconstruction techniques for the graviton spectral functions. We find that the full asymptotically safe quantum cross section decreases in the ultraviolet with the centre-of-mass energy, and is compatible with unitarity bounds. Importantly, our findings provide non-trivial evidence for the unitarity of the asymptotically safe Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Minimal extension of the Standard Model with a mirror symmetry between fundamental fermions and a possible origin of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a specific, nontrivial extension of the Standard Model of weak interactions based on the ${SU(2)}_L\times{U(1)}_Y\times{U(1)}_C$ group. Our motivation follows from the identification of the globally conserved charge $\Omega=\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{L}-\mathrm{Q}$ as a neutrino charge. An intriguing feature of the model is the emergence of a mirror symmetry between neutrinos and electrically charged leptons, as well as between up and down quarks. Following the spontaneous breaking of the weak gauge symmetry with the use of the Goldstone-Higgs iso-doublet, all elementary fermions acquire Dirac masses from Yukawa interaction. The $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons also acquire masses, although with a modified relationship between their respective masses, as compared to the Standard Model. Our model accounts for both chiral components of the neutrino and offers an explanation for the non-observability of the right-chiral neutrino. Additionally, it forbids neutrinoless double-beta decay. Spontaneous breaking of the local $U(1)$ symmetry leads to the new gauge boson $ \mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ mass $M_\mathit{\Omega}$, which we assume to be greater than the mass $m_\chi$ of a new scalar, Higgs-like field $\chi$. The cosmological stability of $\chi$, predicted under this condition, allows for its interpretation as dark matter, interacting exclusively with $\mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ and gravity. From this perspective, we solve and analyze a system of Boltzmann equations that describe the thermal evolution of the number density of $\chi$ dark matter and the $\mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ mediator field within the context of the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ cosmological model. Specifically, we estimate the coupling constant $q$ to be in the range of $\sim 10^{-8.5}\ g$ to $\sim 10^{-6}\ g$ which ensures cosmological stability of the $\chi$ particles.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Cosmological Inference with SDSS-IV eBOSS: Simultaneous Probing for Background and Perturbed Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we explore certain subtle features imprinted in data from the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) as a combined probe for the background and perturbed Universe. We reconstruct the baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) observables as functions of redshift, using measurements from SDSS alone. We apply the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework to model the interdependencies of cosmological observables $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\sigma_8(z)$, and track their evolution across different redshifts. Subsequently, we obtain constrained three-dimensional phase space containing $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts probed by the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Furthermore, assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we obtain constraints on model parameters $\Omega_{m}$, $H_{0}r_{d}$, $\sigma_{8}$ and $S_{8}$ at each redshift probed by SDSS-IV eBOSS. This indicates redshift-dependent trends in $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting a possible inconsistency in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Ours is a template for model-independent extraction of information for both background and perturbed Universe using a single galaxy survey taking into account all the existing correlations between background and perturbed observables and this can be easily extended to future DESI-3YR as well as Euclid results.</description>

      <title>Astrometry meets Pulsar Timing Arrays: Synergies for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision astrometry offers a promising approach to detect low-frequency gravitational waves, complementing pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We explore the response of astrometric measurements to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in synergy with PTA data. Analytical, covariant expressions for this response are derived, accounting for the presence of a possible dipolar anisotropy in the SGWB. We identify the optimal estimator for extracting SGWB information from astrometric observations and examine how sensitivity to SGWB properties varies with the sky positions of stars and pulsars. Using representative examples of current PTA capabilities and near-future astrometric sensitivity, we demonstrate that cross-correlating astrometric and PTA data can improve constraints on SGWB properties, compared to PTA data alone. The improvement is quantified through Fisher forecasts for the SGWB amplitude, spectral tilt, and dipolar anisotropy amplitude. In the future, such joint constraints could play a crucial role in identifying the origin of SGWB signals detected by PTAs.</description>

Abstract: The sphere partition function is one of the simplest euclidean gravity computations. It is usually interpreted as count of states. However, the one loop gravity correction contains a dimension depenent phase factor, $i^{D+2}$, which seems confusing for such an interpretation. We show that, after including an observer, this phase gets cancelled for the quantity that should correspond to a count of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the framework of single-field inflationary models and their compatibility with the cosmological history of the Universe. Our results suggest that, depending on the masses of the formed PBHs, single-field inflation models require more than fine-tuning a potential to induce ultra-slow roll; it necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the post-inflationary cosmological evolution. As an explicative example, we introduce a new model, based on a double inflection point and consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background observations, capable of generating sub-solar PBHs, whose merger could be potentially detectable by the LVK experiment.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

Abstract: Considering the Einstein-Hilbert truncation for the running action in (euclidean) quantum gravity, we derive the renormalization group equations for the cosmological and Newton constant. We find that these equations admit only the Gaussian fixed point with a UV-attractive and a UV-repulsive eigendirection, and that there is no sign of the non-trivial UV-attractive fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario. Crucial to our analysis is a careful treatment of the measure in the path integral that defines the running action and a proper introduction of the physical running scale $k$. We also show why and how in usual implementations of the RG equations the aforementioned UV-attractive fixed point is generated.</description>

Abstract: We study the deflection of light rays in a cold, non-magnetized plasma using the worldline framework. Starting from Synge's Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a position-space action and use it perturbatively to calculate light bending angles. In the homogeneous case, the action reduces to that of a massive particle, allowing us to extract the bending angle of light in the presence of the medium using a well-known analogy. For the inhomogeneous case, we consider a power law model and construct Feynman rules in time to compute the purely plasma-induced corrections to the bending angle at Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO).</description>

      <title>Alleviating cosmological tensions with a hybrid dark sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological model inspired by hybrid inflation, where two scalar fields representing dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interact through a coupling that is proportional to the DE scalar field $1/\phi$. The strength of the coupling is governed solely by the initial condition of the scalar field, $\phi_i$, which parametrises deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this model, the scalar field tracks the behaviour of DM during matter-domination until it transitions to DE while the DM component decays quicker than standard CDM during matter-domination, and is therefore different from some interacting DM-DE models which behaves like phantom dark energy. Using \textit{Planck} 2018 CMB data, DESI BAO measurements and Pantheon+ supernova observations, we find that the model allows for an increase in $H_0$ that can help reduce the Hubble tension. In addition, we find that higher values of the coupling parameter are correlated with lower values of $\omega_m$, and a mild decrease of the weak-lensing parameter $S_8$, potentially relevant to address the $S_8$ tension. Bayesian model comparison, however, reveals inconclusive results for most datasets, unless S$H_0$ES data are included, in which case a moderate evidence in favour of the hybrid model is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1305.5412v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy density of the gravitational field is a full-fledged source of the gravitational field. This principle of Einstein was not implemented by him in the Einstein equation. Not long ago it was possible to find an energy-momentum tensor that is asymptotically equal to part of the Ricci tensor. This tensor was included in Einstein's equation. As a result, Einstein's equation was shortened. The shortened gravitational field equation was initially solved only for the g_{00} field of a point source. Here we obtain the full metric of the gravitational field of a point source using a shortened field equation. The solution is interpreted as a potential well of extreme depth with a radius approximately forty times the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study spin-0 particles described by the Klein-Gordon oscillator formalism in a spacetime which structure is determined by a homogeneous magnetic field and a cosmological constant. For this purpose we take into account a framework based on the Bonnor-Melvin solution with the inclusion of the cosmological constant. We write and solve the Klein-Gordon equation, and then find the energy spectrum by considering the effect of vector and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution in Canonical Quantum Gravity is Trivial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08895v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wheeler-DeWitt (WdW) equation does not describe any explicit time evolution of the wave function, and somehow related to this issue, there is no natural way of defining an invariant inner product that provides a viable probability interpretation. We show that both of these difficulties are solved in a covariant canonical formulation of general relativity where the configuration space is extended by introducing the embedding coordinates as dynamical variables. The formalism describes the evolution of the wave function from one spacelike slice to another, but as in the case of spatial diffeomorphisms this is simply implemented by a coordinate change in the wave function. We demonstrate how the time evolution equation disappears after gauge fixing that removes the embedding coordinates. These findings indicate that the time evolution is trivial in a background independent formulation of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear studies of modifications to general relativity: Comparing different approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the dynamical, nonlinear regime of modified theories of gravity remains a theoretical challenge that limits our ability to test general relativity. Here we consider two generally applicable, but approximate methods for treating modifications to full general relativity that have been used to study binary black hole mergers and other phenomena in this regime, and compare solutions obtained by them to those from solving the full equations of motion. The first method evolves corrections to general relativity order by order in a perturbative expansion, while the second method introduces extra dynamical fields in such a way that strong hyperbolicity is recovered. We use shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity as a benchmark theory to illustrate the differences between these methods for several spacetimes of physical interest. We study the formation of scalar hair about initially non-spinning black holes, the collision of black holes with scalar charge, and the inspiral and merger of binary black holes. By directly comparing predictions, we assess the extent to which those from the approximate treatments can be meaningfully confronted with gravitational wave observations. We find that the order-by-order approach cannot faithfully track the solutions when the corrections to general relativity are non-negligible. The second approach, however, can provide consistent solutions, provided the ad-hoc timescale over which the dynamical fields are driven to their target values is made short compared to the physical timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of black hole-neutron star binaries, particularly those where the black hole has a lower mass compared to other observed systems, have the potential to place strong constraints on modifications to general relativity that arise at small curvature length scales. Here we study the dynamics of black hole-neutron star mergers in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a representative example of such a theory, by numerically evolving the full equations of motion. We consider quasi-circular binaries with different mass-ratios that are consistent with recent gravitational wave observations, including cases with and without tidal disruption of the star, and quantify the impact of varying the coupling controlling deviations from general relativity on the gravitational wave signal and scalar radiation. We find that the main effect on the late inspiral is the accelerated frequency evolution compared to general relativity, and that--even considering Gauss-Bonnet coupling values approaching those where the theory breaks down--the impact on the merger gravitational wave signal is mild, predominately manifesting as a small change in the amplitude of the ringdown. We compare our results to current post-Newtonian calculations and find consistency throughout the inspiral.</description>

      <title>Compact regular objects from an electrified Tolman-like density: A new interior region for the Kerr-Newman spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged static and rotating objects as solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations are obtained and studied in the present work. The full spacetime geometry is obtained by matching two spacetime regions, an interior region containing electrified matter and an exterior electrovacuum region. In the static case, the interior region contains a spherically symmetric distribution of matter constituted by a de Sitter-type perfect fluid with electric charge, whose energy density profile is given by a Tolman-like relation. The interior solution is smoothly matched with the exterior Reissner-Nordstr\"om electrovacuum solution, thus producing different kinds of objects, such as charged regular black holes and overcharged tension stars, that we analyze in detail. We also investigate the connection between the present static solution and the regular black holes with a de Sitter core presented in the work by Lemos and Zanchin [Phys. Rev. D 83, 124005 (2011)]. We then employ the G\"urses-G\"ursey metric and apply the Newman-Janis algorithm to construct a charged rotating interior geometry from the static interior solution. The resulting interior metric and the electromagnetic field are smoothly matched to the exterior Kerr-Newman electrovacuum solution, thus producing a regular interior for the exterior Kerr-Newman geometry. The main properties of the complete rotating solution are analyzed in detail, showing that different kinds of rotating objects, such as charged rotating black holes and other charged rotating objects, also emerge in this solution.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian expansions of extreme mass ratio inspirals of spinning bodies into Schwarzschild black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA are expected to detect inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes. Modeling such inspirals requires fully relativistic computations to achieve sufficient accuracy at leading order. However, subleading corrections such as the effects of the spin of the inspiraling compact object may potentially be treated in weak-field expansions such as the post-Newtonian (PN) approach.
  In this work, we calculate the PN expansion of eccentric orbits of spinning bodies around Schwarzschild black holes. Then we use the Teukolsky equation to compute the energy and angular momentum fluxes from these orbits up to the 5PN order. Some of these PN orders are exact in eccentricity, while others are expanded up to the tenth power in eccentricity. Then we use the fluxes to construct a hybrid inspiral model, where the leading part of the fluxes is calculated numerically in the fully relativistic regime, while the linear part in the small spin is analytically approximated using the PN series. We calculate LISA-relevant adiabatic inspirals and respective waveforms with this model and a fully relativistic model. Through the calculation of mismatch between the waveforms from both models we conclude that the PN approximation of the linear-in-spin part of the fluxes is sufficient for lower eccentricities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a new family of exact vacuum solutions to quadratic gravity that describe pp-waves with two-dimensional wave surfaces that can have any prescribed constant curvature. When the wave surfaces are flat we recover the Peres waves obtained by Madsen, a subset of which forms precisely the vacuum pp-waves of general relativity. If, on the other hand, the wave surfaces have non-vanishing constant curvature then all our solutions are non-Einstein (i.e. they do not solve Einstein's equations in vacuum, with or without cosmological constant) and we find that the curvature is linearly related to the value of the cosmological constant. We show that the vacuum field equations reduce to a simple linear biharmonic equation on the curved wave surfaces, and as consequence, the general solution can be written down. We also provide some simple explicit examples.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the capture of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a new proof on this relation using a geometric analysis, which is carried out using intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrate the existence of photon spheres near black holes assuming most general asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we prove that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis is applicable to any spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation reaction for compact binary systems at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational radiation-reaction force on a compact binary source at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order of general relativity, i.e., 2PN order beyond the leading 2.5PN radiation reaction. The calculation is valid for general orbits in a general frame, but in a particular coordinate system which is an extension of the Burke-Thorne coordinate system at the lowest order. With the radiation-reaction acceleration, we derive (from first principles) the flux-balance laws associated with the energy, the angular and linear momenta, and the center-of-mass position, in a general frame and up to 4.5PN order. Restricting our attention to the frame of the center of mass, we point out that the equations of motion acquire a non-local-in-time contribution at the 4.5PN order, made of the integrated flux of linear momentum (responsible for the recoil of the source) together with the instantaneous flux of center-of-mass position. The non-local contribution was overlooked in the past literature, which assumed locality of the radiation-reaction force in the center of mass frame at 4.5PN order. We discuss the consequences of this non-local effect and obtain consistent non-local equations of motion and flux balance laws at 4.5PN order in the center-of-mass frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous scalarization of black holes typically occurs through the condensation of a scalar field, with the field evolving from a $U(1)$-symmetric phase into a symmetry-breaking one with lower energy. We show that there exist symmetry-breaking phases which are themselves unstable to the formation of an additional scalar condensate, or `cloud', which is partly accreted into the black hole. By studying the fully nonlinear dynamical evolution of the process, we find that symmetry breaking causes the accretion channels of scalar clouds to be non-degenerate, favoring a dominant channel for evolution. Additionally, the final states form a characteristic energy band due to varying amounts of radiation emitted by clouds in different channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogous to the gravitational spin Hall effect (SHE), light possessing the intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) is expected to exhibit ray trajectories deviating from null geodesics when propagating through a gravitational field and we term this phenomenon the gravitational orbital Hall effect (OHE). In our text, we utilize the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to study the ray dynamics of the vortex light in arbitrary curved spacetimes. We start by taking the WKB method to the field action of the optical system and finally obtain the effective ray equations. At large but finite frequencies, the corrections beyond the geodesic equation matters. We also find that these effective equations are the same in form as those for the polarized light, highlighting the consistency between the gravitational OHE and the gravitational SHE. Particularly, we obtain physical quantities within extended geometrical optics, including the Berry connection and the Berry phase, demonstrating their identity as the source of the gravitational OHE. Finally, we derive the equivalent ray equations of vortex light in an inhomogeneous medium and successfully simulate the gravitational OHE in microstructured optical waveguides numerically.</description>

      <title>On the universality of instability in the fundamental quasinormal modes of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on a criterion for the emergence of instability in the fundamental mode recently observed by Cheung {\it et al.}, as a universal phenomenon in the context of black hole perturbations. Such instability is characterized by an exponential spiral, deviating from the quasinormal frequencies due to an insignificant perturbation moving away from the compact object. Our analysis begins with a specific case involving a truncated P\"oschl-Teller potential for which we derive an explicit form of the criterion. Notably, it is shown analytically, contrary to other cases studied in the literature, that the fundamental mode is stable. These derivations are then generalized to a broader context, embracing two underlying mathematical formalisms. Specifically, the spiral is attributed to either the poles in the black hole's reflection amplitude or the zeros in the transmission amplitude. Additionally, we revisit and then generalize a toy model in which perturbations to the effective potential are disjointed, demonstrating that such a configuration invariably leads to instability in the fundamental mode, and the resulting outward spiral always occurs in the counter-clockwise direction. The derived criterion is not restricted to the fundamental mode but is generally relevant for the first few low-lying modes. We demonstrate numerically that the sprial's period and the frequency's relative deviation agree well with our analytical estimations.</description>

      <title>A Generally Covariant Model of Spacetime as a 4-Brane in 4+1 Flat Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a simple toy model of a closed FLRW spacetime by starting from a flat five dimensional scalar field space with a quartic potential. The action contains no curvature terms. An SO(4) invariant ansatz for the scalar fields is shown to lead to a linearly expanding universe. The model is fully covariant and the spacetime metric is uniquely determined from the dynamical equations of the metric tensor provided that the cosmological constant is negative.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy with nonlinear quasi-normal modes</title>

Abstract: The future detection of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) from black hole ringdown will allow for consistency and independent tests of general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we perform a ringdown Fisher forecast when including the dominant quadratic QNM (QQNM) expected in nearly equal-mass quasi-circular binary black holes (BBHs) observed by next-generation ground-based detectors, Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We consider a ringdown model with a total of four modes: three linear QNMs labeled by $(\ell m n)=(220), (330), (440)$ and one QQNM coming from the self-interaction of the dominant linear (220) QNM. We perform a forecast in two scenarios, when the QQNM parameters are considered to be: (a) independent of the linear QNMs; (b) dependent on the (220) QNM parameters, according to GR. In Scenario (a) we find the QQNM to generally be measured with better precision than the (440) mode but worse than the (330) mode. As shown in the past, high-spin BBHs tend to have higher relative QQNMs. Even in such cases, we only expect to confidently detect and resolve these four independent QNMs for nearby events, below redshift $z\sim 0.5$ in ET and CE for intermediate-mass BHs. In Scenario (b) we find the QQNM to be extremely useful for improving the precision on the (440) parameters, with negligible improvements on the (220) parameters. In this case, the (440) parameters are expected to be measured even better than those of the (330) QNM. As a result, we expect to confidently detect and resolve the three independent linear QNMs for events even at high redshifts, up to $z\sim 35$ in ET and CE for intermediate-mass BHs. Therefore, thanks to the inclusion of the QQNM, virtually all second-generation BBH events will provide excellent consistency tests of GR.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation via Knowledge Distillation: A ResNet1D-IAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of gravitational wave astronomy, the increasing number of detected events necessitates efficient methods for parameter estimation and model updates. This study presents a novel approach using knowledge distillation techniques to enhance computational efficiency in gravitational wave analysis. We develop a framework combining ResNet1D and Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF) architectures, where knowledge from a complex teacher model is transferred to a lighter student model. Our experimental results show that the student model achieves a validation loss of 3.70 with optimal configuration (40,100,0.75), compared to the teacher model's 4.09, while reducing the number of parameters by 43\%. The Jensen-Shannon divergence between teacher and student models remains below 0.0001 across network layers, indicating successful knowledge transfer. By optimizing ResNet layers (7-16) and hidden features (70-120), we achieve a 35\% reduction in inference time while maintaining parameter estimation accuracy. This work demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency for gravitational wave data analysis, providing valuable insights for real-time event processing.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from regular black holes in extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a rotating regular black hole spacetime with an asymptotically Minkowski core, focusing on extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRIs) where a stellar-mass object inspirals a supermassive black hole under consideration. Such spacetimes are also called Kerr-like spacetimes, which motivate the investigation of black holes beyond general relativity and the test of the no-hair theorem. In the present article, we consider the eccentric equatorial motion of an inspiralling object in the background of a rotating regular black hole. The dynamics generate gravitational waves (GWs) that imply a loss in energy and angular momentum of the orbiting body. In this scenario, as a result of the radiation reaction, we analytically compute the orbital evolution of the moving object. Further, we generate the gravitational waveforms and constrain the non-Kerr parameter through dephasing and mismatch computations using Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the effect of the additional non-Kerr/deviation parameter with the parameter as small as $\sim10^{-6}$. The constraint on the parameter in the regular black hole using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-5}$. The estimates of our analysis with EMRIs present the possible detectability of Kerr-like geometries with future space-based detectors, and further open up ways to put a stringent constraint on non-Kerr parameters with more advanced frameworks.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing $f(Q)$ Gravity Studies: Observational Cosmology through Deep Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most exciting elements of cosmology is researching the potential of anisotropy in the early cosmos. We examine the expansion of the cosmos over time using an anisotropic Bianchi type-I spacetime subjected to the $f(Q)$ gravity. We do this by limiting the number of cosmological parameters used. The approach, we used is known as CoLFI, which stands for "Estimating Cosmological Parameters with deep learning." This paper presents a revolutionary deep learning-based technique to the parameter inference. The deep learning methodology clearly outperforms the MCMC method in terms of best-fit values, parameter errors, and correlations between parameters. This is the result of comparing the two different ways. Moreover, we obtained the transition redshift $z_{t} = 0.63$ which leads the transitioning model of the Universe from early deceleration to current acceleration phase. The dynamics of jerk parameter and validation of energy conditions of the model are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of solving the dark energy and the coincidence problems by postulating the massless sector of closed strings. This sector constitutes the gravitational multiplet of string theory and, when applied to four-dimensional cosmology, predicts that \textit{the expansion of an open Universe defined in string frame is readily accelerating}. We confront the prediction with the late-time cosmological data of Type Ia supernovae and quasar absorption spectrum, which probe the evolutions of the Hubble parameter and possibly the fine-structure constant. We report that these observations are in admirable agreement with the prediction without any dark sector or coincidence problem. We estimate the Hubble constant, $H_{0}\simeq 71.2\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>Partial alignment between jets and megamasers: Coherent versus selective accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spins play a crucial role in the appearance, evolution, and occupation fraction of massive black holes (MBHs). To date, observational estimates of MBH spins are scarce, and the assumptions commonly made in such estimates have recently been questioned. Similarly, theoretical models for MBH spin evolution, while reproducing the few observational constraints, are based on possibly oversimplified assumptions. New independent constraints on MBH spins are therefore of primary importance. We present a rigorous statistical analysis of the relative orientation of radio jets and megamaser disks in ten low-redshift galaxies. We find a strong preference for (partial) alignment between jets and megamaser that can be attributed to two different causes: coherent accretion and selective accretion. In the first case the partial alignment is due to an anisotropy in the gas reservoir fueling the growth of MBHs. In the second case the spin-dependent anisotropic feedback allows long-lived accretion only if the orbits of the gas inflows are almost aligned to the MBH equatorial plane. A discussion of the implications of the two accretion scenarios regarding the evolution of MBHs is presented, together with an outlook on future observational tests aiming at discriminating between the two scenarios and checking whether either applies to different redshifts and black hole mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the tensor-to-scalar ratio in single-field inflation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a class of simple single-field inflation models and demonstrate that they can readily produce a negligible tensor/scalar ratio $r$. Motivated by recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to stabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms can have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct corrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an effective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$. We find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected CMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on $n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the expansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \propto q^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is the order to which the expansion of $V(\phi)$ is carried out.</description>

Abstract: On-shell methods have found a new application to local observables such as asymptotic radiation fields and gravitational waveforms. While these observables are invariant under small gauge transformations, they are known to depend on a choice of asymptotic gauge; in gravity on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes, this is a choice of BMS frame. In this letter, we provide a method for capturing these supertranslations, to all orders in perturbation theory, using the on-shell framework of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conjectured symmetries of M-theory famously involve (1.) brane-extended super-symmetry (the M-algebra) and (2.) exceptional duality-symmetry (the $\mathfrak{e}_{11}$-algebra); but little attention has been given to their inevitable combination.
  In this little note, we highlight (by combining results available in the literature) that the $local$ exceptional duality-symmetry (the hyperbolic involutory $\mathfrak{k}_{1,10} \subset \mathfrak{e}_{11}$) acts on the M-algebra, through the "brane-rotating symmetry" $\mathfrak{sl}_{32}$, in a way which extends the known hierarchy of finite-dimensional $n$-exceptional tangent spaces compatibly beyond the traditional bound of $n \leq 7$ all the way to $n = 11$.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness of capped black holes: large and small bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new non-BPS solution describing an asymptotically flat, stationary, bi-axisymmetric capped black hole in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This solution describes a spherical black hole, while the exterior region of the horizon exhibits a non-trivial topology of $[{\mathbb R}^4 \# {\mathbb C}{\mathbb P}^2] \setminus {\mathbb B}^4$ on a timeslice. This solution extends our previously constructed three-parameter solution to a more general four-parameter solution. To derive this solution, we utilize a combination of the Ehlers and Harrison transformations and then impose appropriate boundary conditions on the solution's parameters. It can be shown that the resultant solution is free from curvature, conical, Dirac-Misner string and orbifold singularities, as well as closed timelike curves on and outside the horizon. Characterized by four independent conserved charges -- mass, two angular momenta, and electric charge -- this solution reveals two distinct branches: a small bubble branch and a large bubble branch, distinguished by non-conserved local quantities such as magnetic flux or magnetic potential. This shows the non-uniqueness for spherical black holes, even among capped black holes. For equivalent sets of conserved charges, we find that the large/small bubble branch can have larger/smaller entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.</description>

      <title>Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography impose a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the expectation that relativistic symmetries might acquire quantum features in Quantum Gravity, we take the first steps towards a theory of ''Doubly'' Quantum Mechanics, a modification of Quantum Mechanics in which the geometrical configurations of physical systems, measurement apparata, and reference frame transformations are themselves quantized and described by ''geometry'' states in a Hilbert space. We develop the formalism for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ measurements by promoting the group of spatial rotations $SU(2)$ to the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ and generalizing the axioms of Quantum Theory in a covariant way. As a consequence of our axioms, the notion of probability becomes a self-adjoint operator acting on the Hilbert space of geometry states, hence acquiring novel non-classical features. After introducing a suitable class of semi-classical geometry states, which describe near-to-classical geometrical configurations of physical systems, we find that probability measurements are affected, in these configurations, by intrinsic uncertainties stemming from the quantum properties of $SU_q(2)$. This feature translates into an unavoidable fuzziness for observers attempting to align their reference frames by exchanging qubits, even when the number of exchanged qubits approaches infinity, contrary to the standard $SU(2)$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this invited review, we discuss the evaporation of a black hole, with emphasis on the resulting macroscopically distinct patterns of Hawking radiation. The density matrix of this radiation can approach a pure final state in the form of a highly entangled macroscopic superposition state. We note that this exact property is exhibited in replica wormhole calculations, and also in quantum hair effects on Hawking radiation amplitudes. Finally, we revisit the information paradox (Mathur's theorem and firewalls), showing that it can be resolved by macroscopic entanglement.</description>

Abstract: A novel proposal is made to account for the dark matter component of the Universe. Ultralight dark matter with mass $\leq {\cal{O}}(10^{-22})~eV$ is one of the strong candidates for the missing mass which aids the formation of galaxies as well as holding them together. They are also known as fuzzy dark matter(FDM) which will come under Cold Dark matter. The question is what is this particle and its implications. How do we experimentally see it is an outstanding question. We propose to answer some of these questions with some evidences and the estimates.</description>
