      <title>Stochastic Mutation Theory of SARS-CoV-2 Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. Developing an evolutionary model capable of continuously integrating new experimental data is an urgent priority. By employing well-founded assumptions for mutant representation (four-letter and two-letter formats) and the n-mer distance algorithm, we constructed an evolutionary tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that accurately reflects observed viral strain evolution. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X of x randomly generated sites on the spike protein. Our analysis reveals that the position of a generated strain on the tree is determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the proportions of macro-lineages shift: lineage O surpasses lineage N, lineage P overtakes O, and ultimately, new lineage Q surpasses P. We identified threshold values of x that distinguish between macro-lineages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear regression of the number of mutated sites (x) against sample collection dates (t) provides a robust approximation, enabling the prediction of new lineage emergence based on the x-t relationship. To conclude, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains on the evolutionary tree can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites; and the large-scale stochastic sampling uncovers evolutionary patterns governing the emergence of diverse macro-lineages.</description>

      <title>Towards Precision Oncology: Predicting Mortality and Relapse-Free Survival in Head and Neck Cancer Using Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) presents significant challenges in clinical oncology due to its heterogeneity and high mortality rates. This study aims to leverage clinical data and machine learning (ML) principles to predict key outcomes for HNSCC patients: mortality, and relapse-free survival. Utilizing data sourced from the Cancer Imaging Archive, an extensive pipeline was implemented to ensure robust model training and evaluation. Ensemble and individual classifiers, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vectors, were employed to develop predictive models. The study identified key clinical features influencing HNSCC mortality outcomes and achieved predictive accuracy and ROC-AUC values exceeding 90\% across tasks. Support Vector Machine strongly excelled in relapse-free survival, with an recall value of 0.99 and precision of 0.97. Key clinical features including loco-regional control, smoking and treatment type, were identified as critical predictors of patient outcomes. This study underscores the medical impact of using ML-driven insights to refine prognostic accuracy and optimize personalized treatment strategies in HNSCC.</description>

      <title>Beyond Cortisol! Physiological Indicators of Welfare for Dogs: Deficits, Misunderstandings and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to initiate new conversations about the use of physiological indicators when assessing the welfare of dogs. There are significant concerns about construct validity - whether the measures used accurately reflect welfare. The goal is to provide recommendations for future inquiry and encourage debate. We acknowledge that the scientific understanding of animal welfare has evolved and bring attention to the shortcomings of commonly used biomarkers like cortisol. These indicators are frequently used in isolation and with limited salient dog descriptors, so fail to reflect the canine experience adequately. Using a systems approach, we explore various physiological systems and alternative indicators, such as heart rate variability and oxidative stress, to address this limitation. It is essential to consider factors like age, body weight, breed, and sex when interpreting these biomarkers correctly, and researchers should report on these in their studies. This discussion identifies possible indicators for both positive and negative experiences. In conclusion, we advocate for a practical, evidence-based approach to assessing indicators of canine welfare, including non-invasive collection methods. We acknowledge the complexity of evaluating experiential responses in dogs across different situations and the need for continued work to improve practices and refine terminology. This will enhance our ability to accurately understand welfare and improve the wellbeing of dogs, serving to inform standards of animal welfare assessment. We hope this will promote more fundamental research in canine physiology to improve construct validity, leading to better practices, ultimately improving the lives of dogs.</description>

      <title>Single-Cell Proteomics Using Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell proteomics (SCP) is transforming our understanding of biological complexity by shifting from bulk proteomics, where signals are averaged over thousands of cells, to the proteome analysis of individual cells. This granular perspective reveals distinct cell states, population heterogeneity, and the underpinnings of disease pathogenesis that bulk approaches may obscure. However, SCP demands exceptional sensitivity, precise cell handling, and robust data processing to overcome the inherent challenges of analyzing picogram-level protein samples without amplification. Recent innovations in sample preparation, separations, data acquisition strategies, and specialized mass spectrometry instrumentation have substantially improved proteome coverage and throughput. Approaches that integrate complementary -omics, streamline multi-step sample processing, and automate workflows through microfluidics and specialized platforms promise to further push SCP boundaries. Advances in computational methods, especially for data normalization and imputation, address the pervasive issue of missing values, enabling more reliable downstream biological interpretations. Despite these strides, higher throughput, reproducibility, and consensus best practices remain pressing needs in the field. This mini review summarizes the latest progress in SCP technology and software solutions, highlighting how closer integration of analytical, computational, and experimental strategies will facilitate deeper and broader coverage of single-cell proteomes.</description>

      <title>Optimal control in combination therapy for heterogeneous cell populations with drug synergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell heterogeneity plays an important role in patient responses to drug treatments. In many cancers, it is associated with poor treatment outcomes. Many modern drug combination therapies aim to exploit cell heterogeneity, but determining how to optimise responses from heterogeneous cell populations while accounting for multi-drug synergies remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce and analyse a general optimal control framework that can be used to model the treatment response of multiple cell populations that are treated with multiple drugs that mutually interact. In this framework, we model the effect of multiple drugs on the cell populations using a system of coupled semi-linear ordinary differential equations and derive general results for the optimal solutions. We then apply this framework to three canonical examples and discuss the wider question of how to relate mathematical optimality to clinically observable outcomes, introducing a systematic approach to propose qualitatively different classes of drug dosing inspired by optimal control.</description>

      <title>Analytical methods for cytoplasmic streaming in elongated cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cytoplasmic streaming, the coherent flow of cytoplasm, plays a critical role in transport and mixing over large scales in eukaryotic cells. In many large cells, this process is driven by active forces at the cell boundary, such as cortical cytoskeletal contractions in Drosophila and C. elegans embryos, or intracellular cargo transport in plant cells. These cytoplasmic flows are approximately Newtonian and governed by the Stokes equations. In this paper, we use lubrication theory - a powerful technique for simplifying the fluid mechanics equations in elongated geometries - to derive a general solution for boundary-driven cytoplasmic flows. We apply this framework to predict cytoplasmic fluid dynamics and cortical stresses in four systems of biological significance: the Drosophila and C. elegans embryos (including pseudocleavage furrow formation), the pollen tube of seed plants, and plant root hair cells. Our results showcase the elegance and accuracy of asymptotic solutions in capturing the complex flows and stress patterns in diverse biological contexts, reinforcing its utility as a robust tool for cellular biophysics.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-guided deep learning for spatiotemporal forecasting of Tuberculosis outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a formidable global health challenge, driven by complex spatiotemporal transmission dynamics and influenced by factors such as population mobility and behavioral changes. We propose an Epidemic-Guided Deep Learning (EGDL) approach that fuses mechanistic epidemiological principles with advanced deep learning techniques to enhance early warning systems and intervention strategies for TB outbreaks. Our framework is built upon a networked Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model augmented with a saturated incidence rate and graph Laplacian diffusion, capturing both long-term transmission dynamics and region-specific population mobility patterns. Compartmental model parameters are rigorously estimated using Bayesian inference via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. Theoretical analysis leveraging the comparison principle and Green's formula establishes global stability properties of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. Building on these epidemiological insights, we design two forecasting architectures, EGDL-Parallel and EGDL-Series, that integrate the mechanistic outputs of the networked SIR model within deep neural networks. This integration mitigates the overfitting risks commonly encountered in data-driven methods and filters out noise inherent in surveillance data, resulting in reliable forecasts of real-world epidemic trends. Experiments conducted on TB incidence data from 47 prefectures in Japan demonstrate that our approach delivers robust and accurate predictions across multiple time horizons (short to medium-term forecasts). Additionally, incorporating uncertainty quantification through conformal prediction enhances the model's practical utility for guiding targeted public health interventions.</description>

      <title>The Vendiscope: An Algorithmic Microscope For Data Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of microscopy, beginning with its invention in the late 16th century, has continuously enhanced our ability to explore and understand the microscopic world, enabling increasingly detailed observations of structures and phenomena. In parallel, the rise of data-driven science has underscored the need for sophisticated methods to explore and understand the composition of complex data collections. This paper introduces the Vendiscope, the first algorithmic microscope designed to extend traditional microscopy to computational analysis. The Vendiscope leverages the Vendi scores -- a family of differentiable diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics -- and assigns weights to data points based on their contribution to the overall diversity of the collection. These weights enable high-resolution data analysis at scale. We demonstrate this across biology, materials science, and machine learning (ML). We analyzed the $250$ million protein sequences in the protein universe, discovering that over $200$ million are near-duplicates and that AlphaFold fails on proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functions that contribute most to diversity. Applying the Vendiscope to the Materials Project database led to similar findings: more than $85\%$ of the crystals with formation energy data are near-duplicates and ML models perform poorly on materials that enhance diversity. Additionally, the Vendiscope can be used to study phenomena such as memorization in generative models. We used the Vendiscope to identify memorized training samples from $13$ different generative models and found that the best-performing ones often memorize the training samples that contribute least to diversity. Our findings demonstrate that the Vendiscope can serve as a powerful tool for data-driven science.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representations of Molecular Vector-Valued Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules have various computational representations, including numerical descriptors, strings, graphs, point clouds, and surfaces. Each representation method enables the application of various machine learning methodologies from linear regression to graph neural networks paired with large language models. To complement existing representations, we introduce the representation of molecules through vector-valued functions, or $n$-dimensional vector fields, that are parameterized by neural networks, which we denote molecular neural fields. Unlike surface representations, molecular neural fields capture external features and the hydrophobic core of macromolecules such as proteins. Compared to discrete graph or point representations, molecular neural fields are compact, resolution independent and inherently suited for interpolation in spatial and temporal dimensions. These properties inherited by molecular neural fields lend themselves to tasks including the generation of molecules based on their desired shape, structure, and composition, and the resolution-independent interpolation between molecular conformations in space and time. Here, we provide a framework and proofs-of-concept for molecular neural fields, namely, the parametrization and superresolution reconstruction of a protein-ligand complex using an auto-decoder architecture and the embedding of molecular volumes in latent space using an auto-encoder architecture.</description>

      <title>To Bin or not to Bin: Alternative Representations of Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry, especially so-called tandem mass spectrometry, is commonly used to assess the chemical diversity of samples. The resulting mass fragmentation spectra are representations of molecules of which the structure may have not been determined. This poses the challenge of experimentally determining or computationally predicting molecular structures from mass spectra. An alternative option is to predict molecular properties or molecular similarity directly from spectra. Various methodologies have been proposed to embed mass spectra for further use in machine learning tasks. However, these methodologies require preprocessing of the spectra, which often includes binning or sub-sampling peaks with the main reasoning of creating uniform vector sizes and removing noise. Here, we investigate two alternatives to the binning of mass spectra before down-stream machine learning tasks, namely, set-based and graph-based representations. Comparing the two proposed representations to train a set transformer and a graph neural network on a regression task, respectively, we show that they both perform substantially better than a multilayer perceptron trained on binned data.</description>

      <title>CL-MFAP: A Contrastive Learning-Based Multimodal Foundation Model for Molecular Property Prediction and Antibiotic Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the rise in antimicrobial resistance, identifying novel compounds with antibiotic potential is crucial for combatting this global health issue. However, traditional drug development methods are costly and inefficient. Recognizing the pressing need for more effective solutions, researchers have turned to machine learning techniques to streamline the prediction and development of novel antibiotic compounds. While foundation models have shown promise in antibiotic discovery, current mainstream efforts still fall short of fully leveraging the potential of multimodal molecular data. Recent studies suggest that contrastive learning frameworks utilizing multimodal data exhibit excellent performance in representation learning across various domains. Building upon this, we introduce CL-MFAP, an unsupervised contrastive learning (CL)-based multimodal foundation (MF) model specifically tailored for discovering small molecules with potential antibiotic properties (AP) using three types of molecular data. This model employs 1.6 million bioactive molecules with drug-like properties from the ChEMBL dataset to jointly pretrain three encoders: (1) a transformer-based encoder with rotary position embedding for processing SMILES strings; (2) another transformer-based encoder, incorporating a novel bi-level routing attention mechanism to handle molecular graph representations; and (3) a Morgan fingerprint encoder using a multilayer perceptron, to achieve the contrastive learning purpose. The CL-MFAP outperforms baseline models in antibiotic property prediction by effectively utilizing different molecular modalities and demonstrates superior domain-specific performance when fine-tuned for antibiotic-related property prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Neural Architecture Search Reveals Hierarchical Entailment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has suggested that the brain is more shallow than previously thought, challenging the traditionally assumed hierarchical structure of the ventral visual pathway. Here, we demonstrate that optimizing convolutional network architectures for brain-alignment via evolutionary neural architecture search results in models with clear representational hierarchies. Despite having random weights, the identified models achieve brain-alignment scores surpassing even those of pretrained classification models - as measured by both regression and representational similarity analysis. Furthermore, through traditional supervised training, architectures optimized for alignment with late ventral regions become competitive classification models. These findings suggest that hierarchical structure is a fundamental mechanism of primate visual processing. Finally, this work demonstrates the potential of neural architecture search as a framework for computational cognitive neuroscience research that could reduce the field's reliance on manually designed convolutional networks.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Graining Cascades Within Food Webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying population dynamics is a fundamental challenge in ecology and evolutionary biology, particularly for species that are cryptic, microscopic, or extinct. Traditional approaches rely on continuous representations of population size, but in many cases, the precise number of individuals is unknowable. Here, we present a coarse-grained population model that simplifies population dynamics to binary states - high or low - determined by the balance of bottom-up resource availability and top-down predation pressure. This Boolean framework provides a minimal yet analytically tractable alternative to traditional Lotka-Volterra-based models, enabling direct insights into the role of food web structure in shaping community stability. Using this approach, we investigate how trophic interactions influence population persistence, cyclic dynamics, and extinction risk across model food webs. We find that top-down effects are a primary driver of cycling, aligning with theoretical expectations from traditional population models, and that trophic position strongly influences extinction risk, with higher-trophic species more prone to persistent low-population states. Additionally, we explore the role of trophic short-circuits -- direct interactions between apex predators and low-trophic prey -- and find that they can buffer cascades and alter extinction patterns in ways that are often overlooked in classical models. By simplifying population dynamics to a two-state system, this framework provides a powerful tool for disentangling the structural drivers of community stability. These results highlight the potential of coarse-grained approaches to complement existing models, offering new insights into trophic interactions, extinction risks, and the susceptibility of species to trophic cascades.</description>

      <title>Classifying the Stoichiometry of Virus-like Particles with Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virus-like particles (VLPs) are valuable for vaccine development due to their immune-triggering properties. Understanding their stoichiometry, the number of protein subunits to form a VLP, is critical for vaccine optimisation. However, current experimental methods to determine stoichiometry are time-consuming and require highly purified proteins. To efficiently classify stoichiometry classes in proteins, we curate a new dataset and propose an interpretable, data-driven pipeline leveraging linear machine learning models. We also explore the impact of feature encoding on model performance and interpretability, as well as methods to identify key protein sequence features influencing classification.

      <title>Deep Signature: Characterization of Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02847</link>

Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics are essential for deciphering protein functional mechanisms and developing molecular therapies. However, the complex high-dimensional dynamics and interatomic interactions of biological processes pose significant challenge for existing computational techniques. In this paper, we approach this problem for the first time by introducing Deep Signature, a novel computationally tractable framework that characterizes complex dynamics and interatomic interactions based on their evolving trajectories. Specifically, our approach incorporates soft spectral clustering that locally aggregates cooperative dynamics to reduce the size of the system, as well as signature transform that collects iterated integrals to provide a global characterization of the non-smooth interactive dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Deep Signature exhibits several desirable properties, including invariance to translation, near invariance to rotation, equivariance to permutation of atomic coordinates, and invariance under time reparameterization. Furthermore, experimental results on three benchmarks of biological processes verify that our approach can achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Insect Monitoring: Ultra-Lightweight CNNs as On-Device Triggers for Insect Camera Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camera traps, combined with AI, have emerged as a way to achieve automated, scalable biodiversity monitoring. However, the passive infrared (PIR) sensors that trigger camera traps are poorly suited for detecting small, fast-moving ectotherms such as insects. Insects comprise over half of all animal species and are key components of ecosystems and agriculture. The need for an appropriate and scalable insect camera trap is critical in the wake of concerning reports of declines in insect populations. This study proposes an alternative to the PIR trigger: ultra-lightweight convolutional neural networks running on low-powered hardware to detect insects in a continuous stream of captured images. We train a suite of models to distinguish insect images from backgrounds. Our design achieves zero latency between trigger and image capture. Our models are rigorously tested and achieve high accuracy ranging from 91.8% to 96.4% AUC on validation data and &gt;87% AUC on data from distributions unseen during training. The high specificity of our models ensures minimal saving of false positive images, maximising deployment storage efficiency. High recall scores indicate a minimal false negative rate, maximising insect detection. Further analysis with saliency maps shows the learned representation of our models to be robust, with low reliance on spurious background features. Our system is also shown to operate deployed on off-the-shelf, low-powered microcontroller units, consuming a maximum power draw of less than 300mW. This enables longer deployment times using cheap and readily available battery components. Overall we offer a step change in the cost, efficiency and scope of insect monitoring. Solving the challenging trigger problem, we demonstrate a system which can be deployed for far longer than existing designs and budgets power and bandwidth effectively, moving towards a generic insect camera trap.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Generate Diverse Molecules? Towards Alignment with Structural Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in molecular generation, which offers potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the current LLMs overlook a critical requirement for drug discovery: proposing a diverse set of molecules. This diversity is essential for improving the chances of finding a viable drug, as it provides alternative molecules that may succeed where others fail in real-world validations. Nevertheless, the LLMs often output structurally similar molecules. While decoding schemes like diverse beam search may enhance textual diversity, this often does not align with molecular structural diversity. In response, we propose a new method for fine-tuning molecular generative LLMs to autoregressively generate a set of structurally diverse molecules, where each molecule is generated by conditioning on the previously generated molecules. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning to adapt LLMs to autoregressively generate molecules in a sequence and (2) reinforcement learning to maximize structural diversity within the generated molecules. Our experiments show that the proposed approach enables LLMs to generate diverse molecules better than existing approaches for diverse sequence generation.</description>

      <title>Conformation Generation using Transformer Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional conformations of a molecular graph allows insight into the molecule's biological and chemical functions. Fast generation of valid conformations is thus central to molecular modeling. Recent advances in graph-based deep networks have accelerated conformation generation from hours to seconds. However, current network architectures do not scale well to large molecules. Here we present ConfFlow, a flow-based model for conformation generation based on transformer networks. In contrast with existing approaches, ConfFlow directly samples in the coordinate space without enforcing any explicit physical constraints. The generative procedure is highly interpretable and is akin to force field updates in molecular dynamics simulation. When applied to the generation of large molecule conformations, ConfFlow improve accuracy by up to $40\%$ relative to state-of-the-art learning-based methods. The source code is made available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/ConfFlow.</description>
