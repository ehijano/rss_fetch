      <title>Active Cooling Device: A Flexible, Lab-Scale Experimental Unit to Develop Spatio-Temporal Temperature Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental unit that realizes the ``multi-input, multi-output manifold'' thermal management technology proposed by Lamarre &amp; Raymond (2023). The proposed setup can be used for experiments aimed at controlling spatiotemporal temperature distribution. Temperature control is achieved by impinging coolant fluid jets, leveraging a manifold of channels targeted to the surface. The direction of the fluid is controlled by shifting the role of channels between inputs, outputs, or closing them. Files associated with this work include Computer-Aided Design (CAD) STEP files, Gerber files to manufacture a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) written in Python. We provide a step-by-step guide to assemble the experimental setup. We also provide instructions to interact with the setup through the GUI, which allows for real-time tracking of sample temperature and flow rates per flow control device. Additionally, we provide examples of usage of the setup, including system characterization with step response, Proportional-Integral-Derivative performance tracking, and disturbance rejection in a coupled system. Extending the application is accessible through the files provided in the open repository associated with this work. The active cooling device presents a safe, flexible, and complete design, allowing for lab-scale assessment of the performance of custom temperature control strategies using enclosed impinging jets.</description>

      <title>Extreme value distributions of peak loads for non-residential customer segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical grid congestion is a growing challenge in Europe, driving the need for accurate prediction of load, particularly of peak load. Non-time-resolved models of peak load offer the advantages of simplicity and compactness, and among them, Velander's formula (VF) is a traditional method that has been used for decades. Moreover, VF can be adapted into a quantile VF, which learns a truncated cumulative distribution function of peak load based on electricity consumption. This paper proposes a mathematical model based on extreme value theory to characterize the probability distribution of peak load for large non-residential customers. The model underpins the quantile VF as demonstrated through multiple quantile regression and reduces its representation to just four parameters without sacrificing predictive performance. Moreover, using maximum likelihood estimation and the likelihood ratio test, we validate that the probability distribution of peak load of analysed groups belongs to the heavy-tailed Fr\'echet class.</description>

      <title>Graph Analysis to Fully Automate Fault Location Identification in Power Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes graph analysis methods to fully automate the fault location identification task in power distribution systems. The proposed methods take basic unordered data from power distribution systems as input, including branch parameters, load values, and the location of measuring devices. The proposed data preparation and analysis methods automatically identify the system's topology and extract essential information, such as faulted paths, structures, loading of laterals and sublaterals, and estimate the fault location accordingly. The proposed graph analysis methods do not require complex node and branch numbering processes or renumbering following changes in the system topology. The proposed methods eliminate the need for human intervention at any step of the fault location identification process. They are scalable and applicable to systems of any size. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using the IEEE 34-bus distribution test system.</description>

      <title>Time Domain Differential Equation Based Fault Location Identification in Mixed Overhead-Underground Power Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a time-domain fault location identification method for mixed overhead-underground power distribution systems that can handle challenging fault scenarios such as sub-cycle faults, arcing faults and evolving faults. The proposed method is formulated based on differential equations of the system and accounts for the peculiarities of power distribution systems with distributed generations. It considers the presence of loads, multi-phase laterals and sub-laterals, heterogenous overhead and underground lines, and infeeds and remote-end fault current contributions of distributed generations. It utilizes data collected by limited number of measuring devices installed in modern power distribution systems to systematically eliminate possible multiple fault location estimations to provide a single correct estimation of the actual location of the fault. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using IEEE 34-node test system.</description>

      <title>A Configurable Simulation Framework for Safety Assessment of Vulnerable Road Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, electric scooter riders, and motorcyclists, remains a major challenge for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connected and automated vehicles (CAV) technologies. Real-world VRU tests are expensive and sometimes cannot capture or repeat rare and hazardous events. In this paper, we present a lightweight, configurable simulation framework that follows European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) VRU testing protocols. A rule-based finite-state machine (FSM) is developed as a motion planner to provide vehicle automation during the VRU interaction. We also integrate ego-vehicle perception and idealized Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) awareness to demonstrate safety margins in different scenarios. This work provides an extensible platform for rapid and repeatable VRU safety validation, paving the way for broader case-study deployment in diverse, user-defined settings, which will be essential for building a more VRU-friendly and sustainable intelligent transportation system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the wisdom of crowds of linear opinion dynamics models evolving on signed networks. Conditions are given under which models such as the DeGroot, Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) and concatenated FJ models improve or undermine collective wisdom. The extension to dependent initial opinions is also presented, highlighting how the correlation structure influences the feasibility and geometry of the wisdom-improving regions.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tubes based Control of Unknown Multi-Agent Systems for Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on designing a controller for unknown dynamical multi-agent systems to achieve temporal reach-avoid-stay tasks for each agent while preventing inter-agent collisions. The main objective is to generate a spatiotemporal tube (STT) for each agent and thereby devise a closed-form, approximation-free, and decentralized control strategy that ensures the system trajectory reaches the target within a specific time while avoiding time-varying unsafe sets and collisions with other agents. In order to achieve this, the requirements of STTs are formulated as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and solved using a sampling-based scenario optimization problem (SOP) to address the issue of infeasibility caused by the infinite number of constraints in ROP. The STTs are generated by solving the SOP, and the corresponding closed-form control is designed to fulfill the specified task. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through two case studies, one involving omnidirectional robots and the other involving multiple drones modelled as Euler-Lagrange systems.</description>

      <title>Managing Charging Induced Grid Stress and Battery Degradation in Electric Taxi Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating fleets of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces several challenges, some of which are borne by the fleet operator, and some of which are borne by the power grid. To maximize short-term profit a fleet operator could always charge EVs at the maximum rate to ensure vehicles are ready to service ride demand. However, due to the stochastic nature of electricity demand, charging EVs at their maximum rate may potentially increase the grid stress and lead to overall instability. Furthermore, high-rate charging of EVs can accelerate battery degradation, thereby reducing the service lifespan of the fleet. This study aims to reconcile the conflicting incentives of fleet longevity, short-term profitability, and grid stability by simulating a taxi fleet throughout its lifespan in relation to its charging policies and service conditions. We develop an EV fleet simulator to evaluate the battery degradation due to unpredictable charging and ride demand. Consequently, the impact on the power grid through the charging infrastructure is assessed due to these activities. This simulation utilizes publicly accessible real-world travel data from the NYC taxi dataset. We compare a baseline 80-20 fleet charging policy with a reinforcement learning-based policy designed to prolong the fleet's service life and alleviate grid stress. We monitor grid stress, battery degradation, and profitability over five years and find that our learned policy outperforms the baseline. This simulator enables fleet operators to assess the impact of different charging policies on these indicators to make informed decisions in the future.</description>

      <title>Multi-UAV Flood Monitoring via CVT with Gaussian Mixture of Density Functions for Coverage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a control strategy for coordinating multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor unknown flood regions and estimate the extent of inundation. The proposed method adopts a density-driven coverage framework based on Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), in which the density function is modeled using a Gaussian Mixture of Density Functions (GMDF). This formulation provides a more accurate characterization of inundated areas compared to conventional axis-aligned Gaussian models. The performance of the two density modeling approaches is systematically evaluated under different UAV fleet sizes (16, 20, and 24), with multiple simulation trials conducted in the ROS/Gazebo environment. The results show that the GMDF-based formulation consistently achieves higher coverage rates, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing flood monitoring and improving UAV spatial distribution.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions for the Full Class of Signal Temporal Logic Tasks using Spatiotemporal Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for synthesizing time-varying control barrier functions (TV-CBFs) for general Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications using spatiotemporal tubes (STT). We first formulate the STT synthesis as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and solve it through a scenario optimization problem (SOP), providing formal guarantees that the resulting tubes capture the given STL specifications. These STTs are then used to construct TV-CBFs, ensuring that under any control law rendering them invariant, the system satisfies the STL tasks. We demonstrate the framework through case studies on a differential-drive mobile robot and a quadrotor, and provide a comparative analysis showing improved efficiency over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Networks (Opti-KRON) for Three-phase Distribution Feeders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel structure-preserving, Kron-based reduction framework for unbalanced distribution feeders. The method aggregates electrically similar nodes within a mixed-integer optimization (MIP) problem to produce reduced networks that optimally reproduce the voltage profiles of the original full network. To overcome computational bottlenecks of MIP formulations, we propose an exhaustive-search formulation to identify optimal aggregation decisions while enforcing voltage margin limits. The proposed exhaustive network reduction algorithm is parallelizable on GPUs, which enables scalable network reduction. The resulting reduced networks approximate the full system's voltage profiles with low errors and are suitable for steady-state analysis and optimal power flow studies. The framework is validated on two real utility distribution feeders with 5,991 and 8,381 nodes. The reduced models achieve up to 90% and 80% network reduction, respectively, while the maximum voltage-magnitude error remains below 0.003 p.u. Furthermore, on a 1000-node version of the network, the GPU-accelerated reduction algorithm runs up to 15x faster than its CPU-based counterpart.</description>

      <title>Extending Resource Constrained Project Scheduling to Mega-Projects with Model-Based Systems Engineering &amp; Hetero-functional Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the project management context, project scheduling serves as an indispensable component, functioning as a fundamental tool for planning, monitoring, controlling, and managing projects more broadly. Although the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of project management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader literature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its integration into the design and management of complex systems. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the RCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation pipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then to an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the hetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP context as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that the RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an illustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the specialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit explanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control. Overall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while accommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes encountered in large, complex megaprojects.</description>

      <title>Motion Planning and Control of an Overactuated 4-Wheel Drive with Constrained Independent Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.</description>

      <title>Convex Maneuver Planning for Spacecraft Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty, yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing collision risk.</description>

      <title>A Learning-based Model Reference Adaptive Controller Implemented on a Prosthetic Hand Wrist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s. Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic systems, thereby advancing the integration of adaptive intelligent control in wearable assistive devices.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Method for LQG Control via Input-Output-History Representation: Convergence to $O(\epsilon)$-Stationary Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the policy gradient method (PGM) for the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) dynamic output-feedback control problem using an input-output-history (IOH) representation of the closed-loop system. First, we show that any dynamic output-feedback controller is equivalent to a static partial-state feedback gain for a new system representation characterized by a finite-length IOH. Leveraging this equivalence, we reformulate the search for an optimal dynamic output feedback controller as an optimization problem over the corresponding partial-state feedback gain. Next, we introduce a relaxed version of the IOH-based LQG problem by incorporating a small process noise with covariance $\epsilon I$ into the new system to ensure coerciveness, a key condition for establishing gradient-based convergence guarantees. Consequently, we show that a vanilla PGM for the relaxed problem converges to an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-stationary point, i.e., $\overline{K}$ satisfying $\|\nabla J(\overline{K})\|_F \leq \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$, where $J$ denotes the original LQG cost. Numerical experiments empirically indicate convergence to the vicinity of the globally optimal LQG controller.</description>

      <title>Query-Efficient Zeroth-Order Algorithms for Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) has been a powerful framework for solving black-box problems, which estimates gradients using zeroth-order data to update variables iteratively. The practical applicability of ZO critically depends on the efficiency of single-step gradient estimation and the overall query complexity. However, existing ZO algorithms cannot achieve efficiency on both simultaneously. In this work, we consider a general constrained optimization model with black-box objective and constraint functions. To solve it, we propose novel algorithms that can achieve the state-of-the-art overall query complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon^4)$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary solution ($d$ is the dimension of variable space), while reducing the queries for estimating a single-step gradient from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Specifically, we integrate block updates with gradient descent ascent and a block gradient estimator, which leads to two algorithms, ZOB-GDA and ZOB-SGDA, respectively. Instead of constructing full gradients, they estimate only partial gradients along random blocks of dimensions, where the adjustable block sizes enable high single-step efficiency without sacrificing convergence guarantees. Our theoretical results establish the finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithms for nonconvex optimization. Finally, numerical experiments on a practical problem demonstrate that our algorithms require over ten times fewer queries than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field estimation using Gaussian process regression for interactive wireless power system design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) with coupled resonators offers a promising solution for the seamless powering of electronic devices. Interactive design approaches that visualize the magnetic field and power transfer efficiency based on system geometry adjustments can facilitate the understanding and exploration of the behavior of these systems for dynamic applications. However, typical electromagnetic field simulation methods, such as the Method of Moments (MoM), require significant computational resources, limiting the rate at which computation can be performed for acceptable interactivity. Furthermore, the system's sensitivity to positional and geometrical changes necessitates a large number of simulations, and structures such as ferromagnetic shields further complicate these simulations. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), demonstrating for the first time the rapid estimation of the entire magnetic field and power transfer efficiency for near-field coupled systems. To achieve quick and accurate estimation, we develop 3D adaptive grid systems and an active learning strategy to effectively capture the nonlinear interactions between complex system geometries and magnetic fields. By training a regression model, our approach achieves magnetic field computation with sub-second latency and with an average error of less than 6% when validated against independent electromagnetic simulation results.</description>

      <title>Risk Assessment of an Autonomous Underwater Snake Robot in Confined Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.</description>

      <title>Nodal Capacity Expansion Planning with Flexible Large-Scale Load Siting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose explicitly incorporating large-scale load siting into a stochastic nodal power system capacity expansion planning model that concurrently co-optimizes generation, transmission and storage expansion. The potential operational flexibility of some of these large loads is also taken into account by considering them as consisting of a set of tranches with different reliability requirements, which are modeled as a constraint on expected served energy across operational scenarios. We implement our model as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer optimization problem with cross-scenario expectation constraints. To overcome the challenge of scalability, we build upon existing work to implement this model on a high performance computing platform and exploit scenario parallelization using an augmented Progressive Hedging Algorithm. The algorithm is implemented using the bounding features of mpisppy, which have shown to provide satisfactory provable optimality gaps despite the absence of theoretical guarantees of convergence. We test our approach to assess the value of this proactive planning framework on total system cost and reliability metrics using realistic testcases geographically assigned to San Diego and South Carolina, with datacenter and direct air capture facilities as large loads.</description>

Abstract: We study the mathematical properties of the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) when iterating on the measurement update step, following the principles of the well-known Iterated Extended Kalman Filter. This iterative variant of the IEKF (IterIEKF) systematically improves its accuracy through Gauss-Newton-based relinearization, and exhibits additional theoretical properties, particularly in the low-noise regime, that resemble those of the linear Kalman filter. We apply the proposed approach to the problem of estimating the extended pose of a crane payload using an inertial measurement unit. Our results suggest that the IterIEKF significantly outperforms the IEKF when measurements are highly accurate.</description>

      <title>AttentionSwarm: Reinforcement Learning with Attention Control Barier Function for Crazyflie Drones in Dynamic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AttentionSwarm, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate safe and efficient swarm control in a dynamic drone racing scenario. Central to our approach is the Attention Model-Based Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework, which integrates attention mechanisms with safety-critical control theory to enable real-time collision avoidance and trajectory optimization. This framework dynamically prioritizes critical obstacles and agents in the swarm's vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs formally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints. The AttentionSwarm algorithm was developed and evaluated using a swarm of Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadrotors, which were tested indoors with the Vicon motion capture system to ensure precise localization and control. Experimental results show that our system achieves a 95-100% collision-free navigation rate in a dynamic multi-agent drone racing environment, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. This work offers a promising foundation for safe, high-speed multi-robot applications in logistics, inspection, and racing.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Method to Identify Major Contributors to Low-Frequency Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a purely data-driven method to pinpoint generation plants that significantly contribute to poorly damped oscillations as part of post-event analysis. First, Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is applied on PMU data from the point of interconnection (POI) of the plants to obtain the finite-dimensional Koopman operator. Then, modal analysis is performed on a reduced-order Koopman operator to extract spatio-temporal patterns. The data-driven eigenvalues and eigenvectors quantify each plant's contribution to critical oscillatory modes without requiring any system model information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through simulated case studies on modified IEEE 39-bus and WECC 179-bus test systems by benchmarking the data-driven results against ground-truth models. Its performance is further validated using PMU data from real oscillation events in the ISO-New England system. This data-driven method offers a practical tool for both planning-stage simulations and post-event analysis of real oscillation events, enabling effective mitigation.</description>

Abstract: The growing coupling among electricity, gas, and hydrogen systems is driven by green hydrogen blending into existing natural gas pipelines, paving the way toward a renewable-dominated energy future. However, the integration poses significant challenges, particularly ensuring efficient and safe operation under varying hydrogen penetration and infrastructure adaptability. This paper reviews progress in optimization and control technologies for hydrogen-blended integrated gas-electricity system. First, key technologies and international demonstration projects are introduced to provide an overview of current developments. Besides, advances in gas-electricity system integration, including modeling, scheduling, planning and market design, are reviewed respectively. Then, the potential for cross-system fault propagation is highlighted, and practical methods for safety analysis and control are proposed. Finally, several possible research directions are introduced, aiming to ensure efficient renewable integration and reliable operation.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of an Active Car Suspension with a Robust LQR Controller under Road Disturbance, Parameter Uncertainty and White Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02906v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle suspension is important for passengers to travel comfortably and to be less exposed to effects such as vibration and shock. A good suspension system increases the road holding of vehicles, allows them to take turns safely, and reduces the risk of traffic accidents. A passive suspension system is the most widely used suspension system in vehicles due to its simple structure and low cost. Passive suspension systems do not have an actuator and therefore do not have a controller. Active suspension systems have an actuator and a controller. Although their structures are more complex and costly, they are safer. PID controller is widely used in active suspension systems due to its simple structure, reasonable cost, and easy adjustment of coefficients. In this study, a more robust LQR-controlled active suspension was designed than a passive suspension and a PID-controlled active suspension. Robustness analyses were performed for passive suspension, PID-controlled active suspension, and LQR-controlled active suspension. Suspension travel, sprung mass acceleration, and sprung mass motion simulations were performed for all three suspensions under road disturbance, under simultaneous road disturbance and parameter uncertainty and under road disturbance with white noise. A comparative analysis was performed by obtaining the rise time, overshoot, and settling time data of the suspensions under different conditions. It was observed that the LQR-controlled active suspension showed the fastest rise time, the least overshoot and had the shortest settling time. In this case, it was proven that the LQR controlled active suspension provided a more comfortable and safe ride compared to the other two suspension systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale EV Smart Charging Considering Distribution Network Voltage Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer substantial flexibility for grid services, yet large-scale, uncoordinated charging can threaten voltage stability in distribution networks. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for smart charging often disregard physical grid constraints or have limited performance for complex large-scale tasks, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. This paper introduces a physics-informed (PI) RL algorithm that integrates a differentiable power flow model and voltage-based reward design into the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, enabling EVs to deliver real-time voltage support while meeting user demands. The resulting PI-TD3 algorithm achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and reliable voltage magnitude regulation under uncertain and overloaded conditions. Benchmarks on the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus networks show that the proposed PI-TD3 outperforms both model-free RL and optimization-based baselines in grid constraint management, user satisfaction, and economic metrics, even as the system scales to hundreds of EVs. These advances enable robust, scalable, and practical EV charging strategies that enhance grid resilience and support distribution networks operation.</description>

      <title>Planning of Off-Grid Renewable Power to Ammonia Systems with Heterogeneous Flexibility: A Multistakeholder Equilibrium Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-grid renewable power to ammonia (ReP2A) systems present a promising pathway toward carbon neutrality in both the energy and chemical industries. However, due to chemical safety requirements, the limited flexibility of ammonia synthesis poses a challenge when attempting to align with the variable hydrogen flow produced from renewable power. This necessitates the optimal sizing of equipment capacity for effective and coordinated production across the system. Additionally, an ReP2A system may involve multiple stakeholders with varying degrees of operational flexibility, complicating the planning problem. This paper first examines the multistakeholder sizing equilibrium (MSSE) of the ReP2A system. First, we propose an MSSE model that accounts for individual planning decisions and the competing economic interests of the stakeholders of power generation, hydrogen production, and ammonia synthesis. We then construct an equivalent optimization problem based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to determine the equilibrium. Following this, we decompose the problem in the temporal dimension and solve it via multicut generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) to address long-term balancing issues. Case studies based on a realistic project reveal that the equilibrium does not naturally balance the interests of all stakeholders due to their heterogeneous characteristics. Our findings suggest that benefit transfer or re-arrangement ensure mutual benefits and the successful implementation of ReP2A projects.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Identification of Partially Observed Bilinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a realization of a partially observed bilinear dynamical system (BLDS) from noisy input-output data. Given a single trajectory of input-output samples, we provide a finite time analysis for learning the system's Markov-like parameters, from which a balanced realization of the bilinear system can be obtained. Our bilinear system identification algorithm learns the system's Markov-like parameters by regressing the outputs to highly correlated, nonlinear, and heavy-tailed covariates. Moreover, the stability of BLDS depends on the sequence of inputs used to excite the system. These properties, unique to partially observed bilinear dynamical systems, pose significant challenges to the analysis of our algorithm for learning the unknown dynamics. We address these challenges and provide high probability error bounds on our identification algorithm under a uniform stability assumption. Our analysis provides insights into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and sample complexity. Lastly, we perform numerical experiments with synthetic data to reinforce these insights.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment Portfolio of Thyristor- and IGBT-based Electrolysis Rectifiers in Utility-scale Renewable P2H Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems require rectifiers to supply power to electrolyzers (ELZs). Two main types of rectifiers, insulated-gate bipolar transistor rectifiers (IGBT-Rs) and thyristor rectifiers (TRs), offer distinct tradeoffs. IGBT-Rs provide flexible reactive power control but are costly, whereas TRs are more affordable with lower power loss but consume a large amount of uncontrollable reactive power. A mixed configuration of rectifiers in utility-scale ReP2H systems could achieve a decent tradeoff and increase overall profitability. To explore this potential, this paper proposes an optimal investment portfolio model. First, we model and compare the active and reactive power characteristics of ELZs powered by TRs and IGBT-Rs. Second, we consider the investment of ELZs, rectifiers, and var resources and coordinate the operation of renewables, energy storage, var resources, and the on-off switching and load allocation of multiple ELZs. Subsequently, a two-stage stochastic programming (SP) model based on weighted information gap decision theory (W-IGDT) is developed to address the uncertainties of the renewable power and hydrogen price, and we apply the progressive hedging (PH) algorithm to accelerate its solution. Case studies demonstrate that optimal rectifier configurations increase revenue by at most 13.78% compared with configurations using only TRs or IGBT-Rs, existing project setups, or intuitive designs. Under the optimal portfolio, reactive power compensation investment is nearly eliminated, with a preferred TR-to-IGBT-R ratio of 3:1.</description>

      <title>Sub-optimality of the Separation Principle for Quadratic Control from Bilinear Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of controlling a linear dynamical system from bilinear observations with minimal quadratic cost. Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings.</description>

      <title>QPPG: Quantum-Preconditioned Policy Gradient for Link Adaptation in Rayleigh Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable link adaptation is critical for efficient wireless communications in dynamic fading environments. However, reinforcement learning (RL) solutions often suffer from unstable convergence due to poorly conditioned policy gradients, hindering their practical application. We propose the quantum-preconditioned policy gradient (QPPG) algorithm, which leverages Fisher-information-based preconditioning to stabilise and accelerate policy updates. Evaluations in Rayleigh fading scenarios show that QPPG achieves faster convergence, a 28.6% increase in average throughput, and a 43.8% decrease in average transmit power compared to classical methods. This work introduces quantum-geometric conditioning to link adaptation, marking a significant advance in developing robust, quantum-inspired reinforcement learning for future 6G networks, thereby enhancing communication reliability and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>
