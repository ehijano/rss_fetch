      <title>Resonant Dyakonov-Shur Magnetoplasmons in Graphene Terahertz Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene plasmons confine incident terahertz fields far below the diffraction limit and, when hosted by a gate-defined Fabry-Perot cavity, enable electrically tunable, frequency-selective photodetectors. In a magnetic field, these plasmons hybridize with the cyclotron motion to form magnetoplasmons, offering a platform for fundamental studies and for nonreciprocal, spectrally selective, ultrasensitive terahertz photonics. However, implementing magnetoplasmon-assisted resonant transistors at terahertz frequencies has remained challenging so far. Here we use gate-dependent, on-chip terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field to resolve and probe the evolution of resonant magnetoplasmons in antenna-coupled monolayer and bilayer graphene TeraFETs. In monolayer graphene the dispersion reflects the Dirac nature of the carriers, exhibiting a non-monotonic density dependence due to the interplay of plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal plasmon-cyclotron coupling. In contrast, in bilayer graphene we recover and map a magnetoplasmon dispersion consistent with the conventional Schr\"odinger-type picture. These results establish graphene TeraFET devices as a robust on-chip platform for resonant magnetoplasmonics at terahertz frequencies, enabling magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photonics and opening avenues toward photodetectors with enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Classification of coherent peaks in two-terminal quantum devices into normal and anomalous Kondo peaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent peaks arising in the differential conductance of quantum dot (QD) and quantum point contact (QPC) devices are classified into two categories, normal and anomalous Kondo peaks, according to the underlying spin dynamics and the form of the scaling function to which the scaled temperature-dependent linear conductance collapses. The zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) observed in QPCs and in the triplet state of the even sector of quantum dot single-electron transistors (QDSETs) are identified as normal Kondo peaks, formed by spin dynamics involving spin exchange, a symbolic characteristic of the Kondo effect. For these ZBPs, the scaling temperature coincides with half the full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the ZBP observed in the odd sector of QDSETs and all finite-bias coherent peaks, including the coherent side peaks of QPCs and the split ZBP in the singlet state of the QDSET even sector, are identified as anomalous Kondo peaks, because they arise from spin dynamics without spin exchange, and their scaling temperature does not coincide with half the FWHM. To support these findings, we reproduce gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance line shapes measured in the odd sector of a QDSET, demonstrating that its ZBP originates from a combination of two coherent side peaks explicitly observed in QPCs.</description>

      <title>Band inversion transition in HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] crystallographic direction is constructed by using the perturbation theory. Both the anisotropic term and the bulk inversion asymmetry term of the Kane model are taken into account. Although the anisotropic term has converted the crossing between the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands into an anticrossing at $k_{z}R\!=\!0$, the gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure can still occur at the wave vectors $k_{z}R\!\approx\!\pm0.24$ for critical nanowire radius $R\!\approx\!3.45$ nm. The bulk inversion asymmetry does not contribute to the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, i.e., there is no spin splitting in the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands for a [001] oriented cylindrical nanowire.</description>

      <title>Quantized nonlinear transport and its breakdown in Fermi gases with Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized transport not only exist in gapped topological states but also in metallic states. Recently, Kane proposed a quantized nonlinear conductance in ballistic metals whose value is determined by the Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 076801 (2022)]. In this paper, we consider two-dimensional noninteracting fermionic systems whose Fermi surface has nonvanishing Berry curvature. We find that the Berry curvature at the Fermi surface does not affect the quantized nonlinear transport for translationally invariant systems. When spatial inhomogeneity is introduced, such quantization breaks down due to the combined effect of Berry curvature and the gradient of local potential. Such breakdown of quantization can be observed in trapped ultracold atoms with topological bands.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Single-Crystalline Monolayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Producing large-area single-crystalline graphene is key to realizing its full potential in advanced applications, including twistronics. Yet, controlling graphene growth kinetics to avoid grain boundaries or multilayer growth remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate single-crystalline graphene free from multilayer domains via one-step delamination of epitaxial graphene from silicon carbide (SiC). This is enabled by a specific surface reconstruction of 4H-SiC(0001) achieved in our growth conditions. High crystalline quality is confirmed by the observation of the half-integer quantum Hall effect -- the hallmark of monolayer graphene -- in near cm-sized crystals. The scalability of our process, explored with 4''-wafers, represents an advance toward large-scale integration of high-performance graphene applications.</description>

      <title>Characterizing topology at nonzero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare different methods for characterizing topology at nonzero temperatures, as applied to one-dimensional inversion-symmetric fermionic chains and focusing on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Whilst the ensemble geometric phase, a mixed-state generalization of the Zak phase remains well defined at nonzero temperature, the modulus of the corresponding expectation value vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, limiting its practical use. To develop a diagnostic that is suitable also for very large systems, we introduce local density operators acting on neighboring sites, which distinguish topological phases by comparing their expectation values. The topological phase is identified from the relative magnitude of these expectation values, which only requires measuring two local expectation values at nonzero temperature, together with one additional nonlocal expectation value when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is included. In addition, we generalize the local chiral marker to mixed Gaussian states, fully determined by its single-particle correlation matrix, with a nonzero purity gap in their effective single-particle Hamiltonian. The presence of a purity gap ensures that the correlation matrix can be adiabatically flattened to an effective projector. Evaluating the chiral marker with respect to the band-flattened correlation matrix yields a real space topological invariant that coincides with the winding number in the zero temperature limit. The ensemble geometric phase, the local density operators, and the local chiral marker, provide complementary schemes to identify and measure topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain beyond pure states.</description>

      <title>Impact of Electrical Contacts on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides-Based Acoustoelectric and Acousto-Photoelectric Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of electrical contact barriers in hybrid WSe$_2$-LiNbO$_3$-based acoustoelectric and acousto-photoelectric devices using a combination of scanning photocurrent and acousto-electric current spectroscopy. Static scanning photocurrent measurements provide a qualitative measure of the band-bending and spatial distribution of the Schottky barrier between semiconducting WSe$_2$ and gold electrodes whereas the surface acoustic wave-induced acousto-electric current reveals the height of the tunnelling barrier created by the van der Waals gap between the multilayered WSe$_2$ flake and the gold electrodes in addition to the Schottky barrier. The combination of both techniques shows a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent by the acoustic wave. Moreover, the observed spatial redistribution of the current is attributed to the interplay between the contact properties at the source and drain electrodes and the charge carrier dynamics induced by the surface acoustic wave. The ratio of acoustic wavelength to the electrical channel length is found to impact the SAW-induced charge carrier transport. For a channel length shorter than one acoustic wavelength, carriers undergo a seesaw-like motion which changes to charge conveyance for channel lengths comparable or exceeding the acoustic wavelength.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity regimes of resonator-mediated controlled-Z gates between quantum-dot qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) qubits coupled via superconducting microwave resonators provide a powerful means of long-range manipulation of the qubits' spin and charge degrees of freedom. Quantum gates can be implemented by parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gates have been proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the errors arising from approximations used is critical for high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the charge qubit that produces smaller errors and show that the fidelity of the CZ gate outperforms its spin counterpart, resulting in a much smaller fidelity loss of $0.05\%$ compared to $0.80\%$ for the spin qubit, and greater robustness against qubit dephasing and photon loss. We find that drive amplitude -- a parameter dropped in RWA -- is critical for optimizing fidelity, with the charge qubit exhibiting better tolerance to drive amplitude variations. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation.</description>

      <title>Helical Edge Transport in the \nu = 0 Quantum Hall Ferromagnetic State of an Organic Dirac Fermion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally confirm the \nu = 0 quantum Hall ferromagnetic (QHF) state, accompanied by helical edge states, in the layered organic Dirac-fermion system \alpha-(ET)2I3 by demonstrating helical edge transport in multilayers. The saturation of interlayer magnetoresistance (MR) in the high-magnetic-field quantum limit does not scale with the sample cross-sectional area and appears when the magnetic field is oriented along the side surface. The in-plane MR exhibits a similar angle dependence, whereas this feature disappears in the Corbino geometry where no edge channels are present. These results are consistent with helical edge transport in the multilayer QHF state. They also rule out the possibility that the observed angle-dependent MR arises from the chiral magnetic effect expected for a 3D Dirac or Weyl semimetal.</description>

      <title>Screened topological plasmons in graphene plasmonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological effects in an one-dimensional plasmonic crystal formed by the screened acoustic plasmons emerging in a periodically modulated graphene sheet, placed on top of a metallic substrate. To this end, we develop the theory of quantization of screened plasmons, as appropriate for lossless graphene described by a Drude conductivity. By analyzing the resulting band structure, we show that the crystal sustains nontrivial topological bands, with quantized geometric phase. We further show that in a finite, open system, edge states appear within the band gap, which undergo a topological phase transition and merge with bulk states as the modulation increases. Our work provides a robust theoretical framework for the study of band structure and topology of layered media, and extends the possibilities for engineering two-dimensional materials with external modulation.</description>

      <title>Stacking-Induced Large-Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phases hosted by two atomically thin hexagonal lattices and demonstrate the emergence of topological phases with large Chern numbers. Interlayer coupling between two graphene-like lattices produces band crossings, while relative sliding preserves gapless Dirac points located at generic, low-symmetry $\mathbf{k}$ points. The introduction of Haldane-type complex next-nearest-neighbor hoppings gaps these Dirac points, breaks time-reversal symmetry, and generates a sequence of quantum anomalous Hall phases. Depending on the phase angles $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ associated with the two layers, the system exhibits QAH states with Chern numbers $|C|&gt;2$. The nontrivial bulk topology is verified by the presence of the corresponding number of chiral edge modes in ribbon geometries. These high-Chern-number phases originate from the enhanced twisting of the valence-band manifold induced by interlayer stacking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum metric -- which quantifies the distance between quantum states -- is a fundamental component of the quantum geometric tensor, playing a crucial role in a wide range of physical phenomena. Its direct detection and control remains a challenge, requiring suitable material candidates. In this work, we present the emergence of a tunable quantum metric in a versatile two-dimensional material platform, namely, few-layer phosphorene. Using ab-initio-derived models, we show how electric fields can be used to substantially enhance the quantum metric as well as the associated quantum weight. Furthermore, we present a layer-dependent evolution of the quantum metric and its interplay with the electric field in this material. Our results establish few-layer phosphorene as a promising platform for exploring control over the quantum metric and the resulting metric responses in real materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative theory for simulating optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements of optically-active spin centers using steady-state Lindblad equations. We apply the theory to an experimental ODMR spectrum associated with the negatively-charged silicon vacancy V2 center in 6H-SiC, showing that spin Hamiltonian parameters, optical transition rates, and even coherence times may be extracted, with values consistent with recent literature. Notably the $T_2$ spin coherence time is measurable, not just the $T_2^*$ dephasing time. Furthermore, we simulate the ODMR spectra of a V2 center in isotopically-purified 6H-SiC, and predict an order-of-magnitude narrowing of some, but not all spectral lines compared with natural abundance samples.</description>

Abstract: A Mn dopant in a III-V semiconductor produces a highly-entangled, coherent triplet ground state not fully captured by single-determinant theories of electron structure. We directly construct an analytic form for its ground-state wavefunction, finding surprising spin-charge correlations not revealed by semiclassical calculations. Spin-correlated circulating currents associated with the dopant yield remarkably large magnetic fringe fields of $\sim$1$\,\mu$T at distances of $\sim 10$~nm from Mn in GaAs, potentially detectable by NV-diamond magnetometry while the dopant spin coherently precesses.</description>

      <title>Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity and superconducting diode effect mediated via unconventional magnet and Ising spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework in which a one-dimensional (1D) tight-binding model incorporating unconventional magnetic order together with Rashba and Ising spin-orbit couplings are considered to realize two key phenomena in condensed matter systems: topological superconductivity and the superconducting diode effect (SDE). We first elucidate the underlying band topology of the normal-state Hamiltonian and subsequently introduce an on-site attractive Hubbard interaction. Performing a a self-consistent mean-field analysis, we establish superconducting order parameters in both the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing channels. Intriguingly, both pairing states can support topological superconductivity, characterized by a nontrivial winding number, and lead to the emergence of four zero-energy Majorana modes localized at the ends of the 1D chain. The FFLO state further gives rise to an intrinsic field-free SDE, manifested as a nonreciprocal supercurrent and quantified by the diode efficiency $\eta$. Notably, our model yields a large diode efficiency $\eta \sim 65\%$, highlighting its potential for realising topological superconductivity and highly efficient superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Floquet Chern Insulators and Radiation-Induced Zero Resistance in Irradiated Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in optics and time-resolved techniques have facilitated the exploration of new states of matter under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we predict that irradiated graphene can host two novel nonequilibrium steady states of matter with zero resistance when exposed to circularly polarized light: (i) Floquet Chern insulators and (ii) a radiation-induced zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution. Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Field-free diode effects in one-dimensional superconductor: a complex interplay between Fulde-Ferrell pairing and altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of nonreciprocal dissipationless supercurrents in one-dimension manifested through the superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in the absence of any external magnetic field, where inversion symmetry (IS) and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can be intrinsically broken by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and altermagnetism (AM), respectively. We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM.</description>

      <title>Interatomic spin-orbit interaction in a $p$-orbital helical atomic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the interatomic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) from a helical atomic chain composed of $p$-orbitals with intra-atomic SOI, which exhibits a helical state--a potential origin of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. In this model, a strong crystal field in the tangential direction of the helix leads to the formation of energetically separated $\sigma$- and $\pi$-bands. In the second-order process, a spin in the $\sigma$-orbital virtually hops to the $\pi$-orbital, flips its direction due to intra-atomic SOI, and then hops back to the $\sigma$-orbital in the neighboring atom due to the misalignment of $p$-orbitals along the helix. This process induces an interatomic SOI in the $\sigma$-band, which takes the form of a Rashba-type SOI generated by an electric field normal to the helical axis. The magnitude of the SOI is proportional to the curvature, the hopping energy, the intra-atomic SOI energy, and inversely proportional to the crystal field strength. The second-order process also induces long-range second-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We analytically derive the spin-split band structure in the zero-torsion limit.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Spectral Approach to Orbital Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a real-space spectral method for computing the orbital magnetization of crystals. Starting from the commutator form of the orbital magnetization operator, we formulate an energy-resolved spectral function that is amenable to exact Chebyshev polynomial expansions and yields the total magnetization upon integration up to the Fermi level. This avoids the need for computing eigenstates and ground-state projects, providing an efficient numerical framework that is applicable to very large systems even in the presence of disorder and temperature. Our approach is benchmarked on the Haldane model, finding results that are in excellent agreement with the modern $k$-space formulation of orbital magnetization. Leveraging this technique, we extend our study to systems with uncorrelated disorder and point defects, and further show that the bulk Chern number can be directly obtained from the magnetization spectral density. These results open a promising route to investigate orbital responses and topological transitions in real-space models of quantum materials with realistic complexity.</description>

      <title>A Three-Dimensional Array of Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots can confine single electrons or holes to define spin qubits that can be operated with high fidelity. Experimental work has progressed from linear to two-dimensional arrays of quantum dots, enabling qubit interactions that are essential for quantum simulation and computation. Here, we explore architectures beyond planar geometries by constructing quantum dot arrays in three dimensions. We realize an eight-quantum dot system in a silicon-germanium heterostructure comprising two stacked germanium quantum wells, where quantum dots are positioned at the vertices of a cuboid. Using electrostatic gate control, we load a single hole into any of the eight quantum dots. To demonstrate the potential of multilayer quantum dot systems, we show coherent spin control and hopping-induced spin rotations by shuttling between the quantum wells. The ability to extend quantum dot arrays in three dimensions provides opportunities for novel quantum hardware and high-connectivity quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non Hermitian skin effect, where bulk states accumulate at system boundaries, challenges the conventional bulk boundary correspondence. Here we propose a scheme to realize hybrid skin topological states in exciton polariton honeycomb lattices by introducing sublattice dependent gain and loss. This non Hermiticity couples with the intrinsic topological edge modes, leading to relocalization of edge states. We show two distinct regimes: hybrid skin Chern states with switchable localization controlled by TE TM splitting , and hybrid skin antichiral states which preserves the spin polarized property. Our results bridge polariton spin physics and non-Hermitian topology, opening routes toward controllable non reciprocal and spin polarized transport.</description>

      <title>Topological Order in Deep State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically ordered states are among the most interesting quantum phases of matter that host emergent quasi-particles having fractional charge and obeying fractional quantum statistics. Theoretical study of such states is however challenging owing to their strong-coupling nature that prevents conventional mean-field treatment. Here, we demonstrate that an attention-based deep neural network provides an expressive variational wavefunction that discovers fractional Chern insulator ground states purely through energy minimization without prior knowledge and achieves remarkable accuracy. We introduce an efficient method to extract ground state topological degeneracy -- a hallmark of topological order -- from a single optimized real-space wavefunction in translation-invariant systems by decomposing it into different many-body momentum sectors. Our results establish neural network variational Monte Carlo as a versatile tool for discovering strongly correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Purely even harmonic Josephson current due to crossed pair transmission across strongly spin-polarized materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the second harmonic generation in the current-phase relation across ferromagnetic bilayers placed between BCS superconductors. In particular, we consider a strongly spin-polarized metallic ferromagnet coupled to two superconducting leads via thin spin-active (left) and non-spin-active (right) insulating layers. The system is examined in the framework of the quasiclassical Green$^\prime$s function formalism, both in the ballistic (Eilenberger) and the diffusive (Usadel) limit. Strong spin polarization allows for neglecting short-range mixed-spin correlations, and the Josephson supercurrent across the ferromagnet is fully mediated by long-range equal-spin triplet correlations. Using a diagrammatic technique for ballistic propagators introduced in Refs. [1-3], we describe the relevant Andreev processes responsible for the effective conversion of two spin-singlet Cooper pairs in the superconductor into two $\uparrow\uparrow$ and $\downarrow\downarrow$ pairs in the ferromagnet. Contrary to the naive picture of direct conversion, we show that the lowest order process involves four Cooper pairs in the superconductor, among which three are incoming, and one is outgoing, giving rise to net charge transport of 4e across the non-spin-active interface. The self-consistent numerical treatment of the diffusive junction, typically more relevant in experiments, confirms this picture quantitatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use micromagnetic simulations to demonstrate neuron functionality of two-dimensional (2D) chiral magnonic resonators. Our design exploits nonlinear resonant scattering of spin waves propagating in a YIG medium from an edge mode of a permalloy nano-element. The reduced frequency and volume of the edge mode facilitate matching it to the YIG modes and give rise to their wide-angle scattering. As the amplitudes of the incident spin waves increase, the edge mode exhibits a positive nonlinear frequency shift. This shift leads to a complex frequency-dependent nonlinear variation of the amplitude and phase of spin waves scattered in different directions. We show that the scattered waves are strong enough to activate secondary neurons. This provides the connectivity required for combining our proposed neurons into 2D magnonic neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization of a planar, quasi-ballistic Josephson junction array using a Au micron-sized single-crystal. The system exhibits a nonlocal, multiterminal Josephson effect, where the supercurrent between any two superconducting leads is governed by the phase coherence across the entire crystal. Key evidence includes a non-monotonic dependence of the critical current on junction length and magnetic interference patterns with periods corresponding to the shared normal-metal area. Nonlocal transport measurements further confirm that the supercurrent between two electrodes depends on the phase configuration of all the others. Our results, supported by a developed theoretical model, establish a platform for exploring complex superconducting phenomena in multiterminal ballistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for planar quasi-ballistic Josephson junctions, where multiple superconducting leads are coupled through a large, nearly ballistic normal metal crystal. Our approach, based on quasiclassical Eilenberger equations, accounts for the dominant role of electron reflections from the crystal surfaces or single impurities, a mechanism distinct from both purely ballistic and diffusive limits. We calculate the critical current between superconducting leads for various geometries, examining its dependence on temperature and magnetic field. Crucially, we demonstrate that in multi-terminal setups, the junctions are not independent but form a strongly coupled system. The theory successfully explains key experimental observations from a companion work, including a non-monotonic dependence of the critical current on the interlayer length, providing a foundation for designing and understanding complex multi-terminal Josephson systems.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Levitated Neon Particle Arrays for Robust and Scalable Electron Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Josephson diode effect in minimal Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of the nonlocal Josephson effect in a system composed of three laterally coupled minimal Kitaev chains and exploit it to realize the nonlocal Josephson diode effect. We find that an imbalance between crossed Andreev reflections and electron cotunneling in the middle Kitaev chain gives rise to an asymmetric $2\pi$-periodic phase-dependent Andreev spectrum, controlled by the superconducting phases across the left and right junctions. We then show that the asymmetric Andreev spectrum, formed by hybridized Andreev bound states at the left and right junctions, enables a supercurrent across one junction via the phase difference at the other junction, thereby signaling the nonlocal Josephson effect. Notably, these nonlocal Josephson supercurrents exhibit distinct positive and negative critical currents, demonstrating the realization of the nonlocal Josephson diode effect with highly tunable polarity and efficiencies exceeding $50\%$. The nonlocal Josephson diode effect requires breaking local time-reversal and local charge-conjugation symmetries, with the latter being unique to minimal Kitaev chains. Our results establish minimal Kitaev chains as a highly controllable platform for engineering nonlocal Josephson phenomena.</description>

Conventional fabrication methods of the hybrid heterostructures rely on transferring graphene grown on metallic substrates-- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to introducing numerous defects. In this study, we present a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of graphene on insulating substrates by employing three different perovskite oxide substrates (SrTiO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$, and (La$_{0.18}$Sr$_{0.82}$)(Al$_{0.59}$Ta$_{0.41}$)O$_3$) using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition. Comprehensive characterization via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a uniform, continuous monolayer graphene on all substrates. We identified that growth temperature critically governs graphene quality, as excessive active species may lead to secondary nucleation and the formation of multilayer graphene. Notably, all substrates shared the same optimal growth conditions. Low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy of the graphene/SrTiO$_3$ hybrid heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling. Our work establishes a reproducible, transfer-free fabrication route for graphene/perovskite oxide hybrid heterostructures and provides empirical support for the universal growth of graphene on insulating substrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric phases can manifest when a relativistic quantum particle moves cyclically along a loop in parameter space. The phase can be affected by the presence of a background field and can be accompanied by nontrivial topological features. The appearance of adiabatic geometric phases in momentum space is demonstrated for a Lorentz-violating Weyl fermion, where the role of the background is played by the coefficients for Lorentz violation. As explicit examples, the Berry curvature and the first Chern number are derived for two cases with large Lorentz violation, one incorporating CPT violation and one preserving CPT symmetry. Some alternative topological invariants are also obtained. In certain scenarios with large Lorentz violation, the physical vacuum is associated with a topological phase.</description>

      <title>Role of impurity statistics and medium constraints in polaron-polaron interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the behavior of a small density of mobile impurities (polarons) immersed in a quantum gas, a generic scenario that can be realized in cold atomic gases, liquid helium mixtures and doped semiconductors. We present a unified theoretical framework for understanding polaron quasiparticles beyond the single-impurity limit, and we identify two key factors that control the polaron-polaron interactions: (i) the statistics of the impurities, including whether or not they are degenerate, and (ii) the constraints on the medium response, i.e., whether the medium density or chemical potential is held fixed. By constructing wave functions for two bosonic, fermionic, or distinguishable impurities immersed in a Bose or Fermi gas, we derive rigorous results for the polaron interactions in the limit of weak impurity-medium coupling. We furthermore obtain an exact relationship between the polaron interactions at fixed medium density and at fixed chemical potential, a result which is valid for arbitrary interaction strength. Our work provides an important guide for understanding experiments, and it acts as a starting point for future strong-coupling theories of polaron interactions that capture all of the effects identified in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the electron neutrino mass is a long-standing objective and requires a high energy resolution of certain $\beta$-decay experiments, as well as a visible cosmic neutrino background ($C{\nu}B$) spectrum. Many quantum mechanical and chemical effects could potentially impair the required resolution/visibility, e.g., the Coulomb interactions between the electrons in the \b{eta}-decaying impurity and in the solid-state environment. We analyze the effect when hybridization is suppressed completely using a dielectric spacer, and also when hybridization is present up to the lowest nontrivial order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore, both analytically and numerically, the quantum dynamics of a many-body free-fermion system subjected to local density measurements. We begin by extending the mapping to the nonlinear sigma-model (NLSM) field theory for the case of finite evolution time $T$ and different classes of initial states, which lead to different NLSM boundary conditions. The analytical formalism is then used to study how quantum correlations gradually develop, with increasing $T$, from those determined by the initial state towards their steady-state form. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations for several types of initial states. We further consider the long-time limit, when the system in $d+1$ space-time dimensions becomes quasi-one-dimensional, and analyze the scaling of the ``localization'' time (which is simultaneously the purification time and the charge-sharpening time for this class of problems). The analytical predictions for scaling properties are fully confirmed by numerical simulations in a $d=2$ model around the measurement-induced phase transition. We use this dynamical approach to determine numerically the measurement-induced transition point and the associated correlation-length critical exponent.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theory of a dynamical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (dDMI) in centrosymmetric crystals by generally considering the vibration of both cations and anions. It gives rise to an antisymmetric spin-lattice coupling, inducing magnon-phonon hybridized topological excitations. Moreover, we find that this dDMI naturally exhibits a magnetoelectric feature, leading to the presence of dynamic multiferroicity with finite toroidal moment distribution in the momentum space. By comparing toroidal moments with band skyrmion structure, we reveal the intrinsic connection between band topology and dynamic multiferroicity through the dDMI.</description>

Abstract: Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain~(FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized spin textures, are promising candidates for future memory devices and non-conventional computing applications due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions, and low-power manipulation capabilities. Despite their significant potential, the reliable electrical readout of individual skyrmions remains a fundamental challenge. While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous Hall effect (AHE)-based techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications. Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. We present an analytical formula for the skyrmion AHE readout signal, demonstrating scalability from micrometer to nanometer skyrmions. These advances establish a robust platform for skyrmion-based sensors, counters and unconventional computing systems that depend on precise individual skyrmion control and detection.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport in Ultrahigh-Conductivity Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers fabricated via solution spinning, focusing on the roles of structural dimensionality and quantum interference effects. The fibers exhibit metallic behavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as the temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below this temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling, signaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with localization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low temperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the effective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL models in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can reproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our fiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the experimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework that quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using realistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter. Although this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude correction, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure of CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a 3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent transport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing conductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications.</description>

Abstract: High-fidelity detection of charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs) is a key ingredient in solid state quantum computation. We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</description>

Abstract: Spin pumping is a microwave-driven means for injecting spins from a ferromagnet into the adjacent target material. The insertion of a thin antiferromagnetic layer between the ferromagnet and the target material is known to enhance the spin pumping signal. Here, in view of describing dynamic fluctuations of the N\'{e}el order parameter, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin pumping in a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/heavy metal trilayer in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$. When there exists an interfacial exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic spins and the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el order parameter at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface, we find a strongly frequency-dependent enhancement of the pumped spin current that is peaked at $T_{\rm N}$. The present finding offers an explanation for the enhanced spin pumping with strong frequency dependence observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/CoO/Pt system.</description>

      <title>Suppression of quantized heat flow by the dielectric response of a compressible strip at the quantum Hall edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility, we obtain leading corrections to both the heat flux carried by the edge plasmon and to its spectrum. Two generic regimes emerge: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, producing a negative correction to the quantized heat flux that scales as T^4 at low temperatures together with a convex cubic shift of the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, yielding a crossover from T^4 to T^{3/2} scaling and a change of sign in the correction. We further introduce a microscopic dipolar model in which the edge couples electrostatically to localized dipole moments inside a wide compressible strip. This long-range interaction amplifies the nonlocal dielectric back-action and generates new suppression laws, T^3 or even T^2 for smooth disorder profiles, together with a universal ratio connecting spectral curvature to thermal response. Across all regimes, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit of the plasmon contribution reflects reversible heat drag into the compressible strip rather than a breakdown of quantization. The framework thus provides a coherent and quantitatively plausible explanation of the "missing heat flux" anomaly and unifies the thermal and spectral signatures of quantum Hall edge dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under chiral thermoelectric drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bifurcation and Anomalous Supercurrent in Dissipative Topological Insulator-based Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topological protection and dissipation constitutes a critical frontier in the realization of hybrid quantum devices. Here, we investigate the transport signatures in a dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junction, a platform that directly probes the competition between quantum coherence and loss. We model dissipation by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead to the junction, described effectively by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived using the Lindblad formalism. We observe that the junction exhibits an asymmetric complex Andreev spectrum, where the imaginary energy component imposes a finite lifetime on the quasi-bound states. Furthermore, beyond specific phase intervals, the real component of the spectrum bifurcates: one branch merges with the continuum, while the other penetrates just below the superconducting gap. Crucially, the characteristic zero-energy crossing shifts away from $\phi=\pi$ and acquires a non-zero imaginary component; consequently, the associated Majorana bound states acquire a finite lifetime, signaling a loss of robustness against dissipation. Finally, this spectral asymmetry drives an anomalous supercurrent, manifested as a non-vanishing current at zero phase difference. Our results reveal how dissipation fundamentally reshapes superconducting transport in topological junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered quantum devices.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Vortex Crystals in Tetrahedral Antiferromagnets: Fractional Charges and Topological Magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the formation of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal in the tetrahedral antiferromagnetic order on a triangular lattice. The noncoplanar tetrahedral state consists of four sublattices with spins oriented along the faces of a tetrahedron in spin space. The long-range order characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology arises due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and appears at zero temperature and without external fields. Each vortex carries a half-integer electric charge relative to the uniform background in itinerant magnets, enabling the emergence of anyonic excitations. Its magnetic excitations include magnetically active gyrotropic and breathing modes, which -- under an external magnetic field -- carry nontrivial Chern numbers that stabilize chiral magnon edge states.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Origin of Quantum-Metric Effects via Momentum-Space Metric Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of quantum signal processing via the adiabatic-impulse model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</description>

      <title>Proximity effect and p-wave superconductivity in s-wave superconductor/helimagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that in contrast to homogeneous ferromagnetism helical magnetism is compatible with superconductivity and causes only weak suppressive effect on superconducting critical temperature. Despite this fact it induces p-wave triplet superconducting correlations in homogeneous superconducting systems with intrinsic helical magnetism. The combination of these two facts indicates a high potential for the application of such systems in disspationless spintronics. For this reason here we investigate the proximity effect in atomically thin superconductor/helical (conical) magnet heterostructures (SC/HM). It is shown that in SC/HM heterostructures the strength of the proximity effect and, in particular, amplitude of p-wave triplet superconductivity and the degree of superconductivity suppression are complex functions of the magnet exchange field and filling factors of the magnet and the superconductor. Further we demonstrate that $p$-wave correlations ensure transport spin supercurrent flow in the SC/HM heterostructure with conical magnets and unveil the physical relationship between the transport spin supercurrent, degree of the magnet conicity and internal structure of p-wave correlations in the momentum space.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation in an elastic lattice with non-reciprocal stiffness and engineered damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate, while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves, and also boundary-induced wave interference arising from divergent and convergent reflected wave trajectories with varying growth rates. These findings provide a theoretical framework for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave propagation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Heralded Emission Detection in InAs/ZnSe Quantum Dot Solids Using Time-Correlated Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations between photons is an emerging frontier in optical spectroscopy, yet experimental demonstrations have largely remained limited to molecular systems at room temperature. Here, we investigate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dot (QD) solids at low temperatures. We demonstrate the advantages of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for high time resolution ($\sim$72 ps) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for high emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). Second-order photon-correlation analysis reveals exciton lifetimes and fine-structure energy splittings. These results establish NIR colloidal QDs as a bright, tunable model system for quantum-light spectroscopy and highlight their compatibility with optical cavities as a further experimental control parameter.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking machine learning models for multi-class state recognition in double quantum dot data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.</description>
