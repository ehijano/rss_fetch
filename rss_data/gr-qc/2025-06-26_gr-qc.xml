      <title>Adding equatorial-asymmetric effects for spin-precessing binaries into the SEOBNRv5PHM waveform model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from spin-precessing binaries exhibit equatorial asymmetries absent in non-precessing systems, leading to net linear momentum emission and contributing to the remnant's recoil. This effect, recently incorporated into only a few waveform models, is crucial for accurate recoil predictions and improved parameter estimation. We present an upgrade to the SEOBNRv5PHM model -- SEOBNRv5PHM_w/asym -- which includes equatorial asymmetric contributions to the l=m&lt;=4 waveform modes in the co-precessing frame. The model combines post-Newtonian inputs with calibrated amplitude and phase corrections and a phenomenological merger-ringdown description, tuned against 1523 quasi-circular spin-precessing numerical relativity waveforms and single-spin precessing test-body plunging-geodesic waveforms. We find that SEOBNRv5PHM_w/asym improves the agreement with NR waveforms across inclinations, with median unfaithfulness reduced by up to 50% compared to SEOBNRv5PHM, and achieves 30-60% lower unfaithfulness than IMRPhenomXPNR and 76-80% lower than TEOBResumS_Dali. The model significantly improves the prediction of the recoil velocity, reducing the median relative error with numerical relativity from 70% to 1%. Bayesian inference on synthetic injections demonstrates improved recovery of spin orientations and mass parameters, and a reanalysis of GW200129 shows a threefold increase in the spin-precessing Bayes factor, highlighting the importance of these effects for interpreting spin-precessing events.</description>

      <title>Waging a Campaign: Results from an Injection-Recovery Study involving 35 numerical Relativity Simulations and three Waveform Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Bayesian inference results from an extensive injection-recovery campaign to test the validity of three state of the art quasicircular gravitational waveform models: \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM}, the latter with the \textsc{SpinTaylorT4} implementation for its precession dynamics. We analyze 35 strongly precessing binary black hole numerical relativity simulations with all available harmonic content. Ten simulations have a mass ratio of $4:1$ and five, mass ratio of $8:1$. Overall, we find that \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM} is the most consistent model to numerical relativity, with the majority of true source properties lying within the inferred 90\% credible interval. However, we find that none of the models can reliably infer the true source properties for binaries with mass ratio $8:1$ systems. We additionally conduct inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) consistency tests to determine if our chosen state of the art waveform models infer consistent properties when analysing only the inspiral (low frequency) and ringdown (high frequency) portions of the signal. For the simulations considered in this work, we find that the IMR consistency test depends on the frequency that separates the inspiral and ringdown regimes. For two sensible choices of the cutoff frequency, we report that \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM} can produce false GR deviations. Meanwhile, we find that \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM} is the most reliable model under the IMR consistency test. Finally, we re-analyze the same 35 simulations, but this time we incorporate model accuracy into our Bayesian inference. Consistent with the work in Hoy et al. 2024 [arXiv: 2409.19404], we find this approach generally yields more accurate inferred properties for binary black holes with less biases compared to methods that combine model-dependent posterior distributions based on their evidence, or with equal weight.</description>

      <title>Compact Cauchy horizons admit constant surface gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that in any spacetime dimension and under the dominant energy condition, every totally geodesic connected smooth compact null hypersurface (hence every compact Cauchy horizon) admits a smooth lightlike tangent vector field of constant surface gravity. That is, we solve the open degenerate case by showing that, if there is a complete generator, then there exists a smooth future-directed geodesic lightlike tangent field. The result can be stated as an existence result for a particular cohomological equation. The proof uses elements of ergodic theory, Hodge theory and Riemannian flow theory.</description>

      <title>Hair imprints of the gravitational decoupling and hairy black hole spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hairy black holes by gravitational decoupling (GD) are probed to derive the gravitational waveform produced by perturbation theory applied to these compact objects. Using the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations governing the metric perturbations and applying a higher-order WKB method, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) are computed and discussed. Compared to the QNMs produced in the ringdown phase of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole solutions, it yields a clear physical signature of primary hair imprinting the hairy GD black hole gravitational waveforms.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Frame Representation for General High-Frequency Gravitational Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave (GW) experiments will explore higher frequency ranges, where GW wavelengths approach the size of the detector itself. In this regime, GWs may be detected not just through the well-known mechanical deformation by tidal forces but also via induced effective currents in electromagnetic background fields. However, the calculation of this signal requires the GW metric in laboratory coordinates of the detector, and an accurate transformation to all orders into this frame is necessary. In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for the metric transformation of general chirp-like waveforms expressed in terms of the transverse-traceless GW metric, its integral, and its derivative. For more complex signals, where analytical integration is impractical, we provide an efficient approximation based on Taylor expansions of the retarded time to coalescence. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied to calculate the signal response of a large class of detectors. Our approach provides essential tools for designing and interpreting high-frequency GW experiments that search for compact object mergers at MHz to GHz frequencies beyond the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Emergent Lorentzian Geometries from Spin-Foams and Group Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Lorentzian geometries in spin-foams and group field theories is investigated. The spectral dimension of periodic Euclidean spin-foam frusta is studied. At large scales, the spectral dimension is generically four. At lower scales, a non-trivial flow of the spectral dimension is observed, sensitive to quantum effects, curvature induced oscillations and the parameters of the theory. The removal of numerical cutoffs and a thermodynamic limit is discussed, suggesting a phase transition from zero to four large-scale dimensions. Lorentzian Regge calculus for (3+1) cosmology, modelled with Lorentzian 4-frusta, coupled to a massless free scalar field is studied. It is shown that causal regularity, solutions to the Regge equations and a continuum limit only exist if the cells connecting neighboring slices are timelike. The dynamics can be expressed relationally only in the small deficit angle limit. Effective (2+1) spin-foam cosmology with a minimally coupled massive scalar field is investigated. The scalar field mass is shown to ensure convergence of the path integral. The classicality of expectation values is shown to be intimately connected to causal regularity and the path integral measure. A causal completion of the Barrett-Crane group field theory model is developed. Its amplitudes are explicitly computed in spin representation using methods from integral geometry. A Landau-Ginzburg analysis is applied to the complete Barrett-Crane (BC) group field theory model. It is shown that mean-field theory is generically self-consistent, and that timelike faces do not contribute to the critical behavior. Employing the complete BC model, a physical Lorentzian reference frame is coupled, and scalar cosmological perturbations are extracted from entangled GFT coherent states. The dynamics of these perturbations are shown to agree with classical results up to quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Dimension of the isometry group in type N vacuum solutions: an IDEAL approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions for a type N vacuum solution (with cosmological constant) to admit a group of isometries of dimension $r$ are given in terms of the invariant concomitants of the Weyl tensor. This study requires defining several invariant classes, and for each class, the conditions that determine the dimension are given. Thus, an IDEAL (Intrinsic, Deductive, Explicit and ALgorithmic) characterisation of these spacetimes follows. Some examples show that our algorithmic results can easily be implemented on the \textit{xAct Mathematica} suite of packages. The relation between our classes and already known families of solutions of Einstein equations is outlined.</description>

      <title>Many phases in a hairy box in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I investigate gravitational thermodynamics of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar system in three dimensions without a cosmological constant. In the previous work by Krishnan,Shekhar, and Bala Subramanian (Nucl. Phys. B 958 (2020) 115115 [33]), it was argued that this system has no BH saddles, but has only empty (flat space) saddles and boson star saddles. It was then concluded that the structure of the thermodynamic phase space is much simpler than in the higher dimensional cases. I will show that, in addition to the known boson star and empty saddles, three more types of saddles exist in this system: the BG saddle, its hairy generalization, and a novel configuration called the boson star-PL saddle. As a result, the structure is richer than one might naively expect and is very similar to the higher dimensional ones.</description>

      <title>Predicting wide binaries and deviations from standard gravity using machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework for the detection of wide binary star systems and the identification of deviations from standard gravity using Gaia DR3 data. By training supervised ML models on established wide binary catalogues, we efficiently classify wide binaries and employ clustering and nearest neighbour search to pair candidate systems. We recast the problem of identifying systematic deviations from standard gravity as a supervised anomaly detection. Our approach incorporates data preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE, correlation analysis, and PCA, and achieves high accuracy and recall in both binary classification and anomaly detection tasks. The resulting publicly available code enables rapid, scalable, and customizable analysis of wide binaries and gravitational anomalies, complementing conventional analyses and providing a valuable resource for future astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Fermionic S-matrix and cosmological correlators: T-violation at O(H)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Bunch-Davies (BD) and Unruh-de Witt (UdW) de Sitter S-matrices in the presence of spin-$1/2$ fermions. Building on recent work, this enables us to correlate the de Sitter S-matrix with cosmological correlators. We consider a finite-time version of the UdW S-matrix to study $O(H)$ corrections to some typical particle physics processes such as beta decay. Owing to the lack of time-reversal symmetry in the expanding Poincar\'e patch, we find signatures of intrinsic T-violation in polarized beta decay. The observable we study begins at $O(H)$. The possibility of T-violation was examined theoretically in the 1950's by Jackson, Treiman, and Wyld in flat space and has been probed more recently in the emiT experiment, with the purpose of examining fundamental T-violation coming from additional interactions in the Lagrangian. Our analysis places a lower bound on the intrinsic T-violation in the expanding Poincar\'e patch. At $O(H)$, we find both energy conserving and energy non-conserving contributions. Surprisingly, the energy-violating piece, in principle, can give large T-violation at fine-tuned values of the kinematical variables.</description>

      <title>Bounds on QCA Lattice Spacing from Data on Lorentz Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that discrete quantum walks, when extended to quantum cellular automata (QCA), can, in the continuum limit, reproduce relativistic wave equations and quantum field theories (QFTs), including free quantum electrodynamics (QED). This QCA/QFT correspondence bridges quantum information processing and high-energy physics, raising fundamental questions about the nature of spacetime: whether it is the continuum QFT or the discrete QCA that is fundamental. For while Lorentz invariance appears robust experimentally, it may only approximate a deeper discrete structure, particularly at Planck-scale energies. This high-energy Lorentz violation is potentially observable either through cumulative effects over cosmic distances or via small deviations at accessible energies. In this paper, we analyze the QCA corresponding to QED and show that it implies both a deviation from the speed of light and spatial anisotropies. Using current experimental and astrophysical constraints, we place upper bounds on the QCA lattice spacing, providing insight into the plausibility of a fundamentally discrete spacetime.</description>

      <title>Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10x10 pixel map of a 1 R_Earth world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per "micro-pixel". We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based extremely large telescopes with extreme adaptive optics; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); and (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals - exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization - each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the astrometric resolution and photon-budget thresholds needed to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits - but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens - providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once a spacecraft reaches &gt;=550 AU - remains the only near-term, scientifically and technologically viable means to acquire true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Bulk Current in Quantum Hall Systems with an Expanding Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding topological phases of matter is essential for advancing both the fundamental theory and practical applications of condensed matter physics. Recently, a theoretical framework for a quantum Hall system with an expanding edge state was proposed [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 105}, 105009 (2022)], revealing the existence of an energy flux analogous to Hawking radiation on the edge. Motivated by this work, we extend the analysis to a model of a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime that includes both the bulk and edge regions. Due to the presence of bulk and edges, we demonstrate that the covariant form of the gravitational anomaly appears on the edge via the anomaly-inflow mechanism. Then, we investigate the energy flux on the edge from the viewpoint of gravitational anomalies, such as covariant gravitational and Weyl anomalies. We also find that, due to the conservation of energy and momentum in the entire system, the presence of anomalous currents on the expanding edge induces non-trivial currents in the bulk originating from the expansion of the edge.</description>

      <title>Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Stretched Horizon Dissipation and the Fate of Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the dissipation of infalling particles near black holes under the assumption that the equivalence principle breaks down at the stretched horizon. This violation allows partial reflection of particles just outside the event horizon, as suggested by models such as the fuzzball and firewall proposals. We show that scattering with blue-shifted Hawking radiation leads to moderate dissipation when the particle energy is comparable to the Hawking temperature. The decay rate is independent of the Planck mass, and therefore gravitational wave echoes-arising from such partial reflection-may survive despite the presence of quantum gravitational effects. Our result is universal and does not rely on the detailed microphysics of the horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity with positive cosmological constant coupled to matter in an asymptotically de Sitter universe with sphere boundary at timelike infinity. In this setting we show that, to one-loop order and at late time, the norm of the no-boundary state vanishes, going as $ e^{S_0} \frac{Z S_0^{-d(d+1)/4}}{\text{vol}(SO(d,1))}$ with $S_0$ the tree-level entropy of the static patch, $d$ the spacetime dimension, and $Z$ non-negative. While we expect a non-zero norm to arise at two loops, the presence of an observer already stabilizes it to a large, finite value at one loop.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Energy Injection in Turbulent Neutron Star Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. Using a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate with phenomenological damping and a pinning potential to mimic the crust, we model the dynamics underlying these events. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which sustains turbulent fluctuations in pulsar glitches. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. These findings provide a robust analogy for neutron star glitch phenomena and offer new insights into turbulence in extreme astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Radiated Angular Momentum from Spinning Black Hole Scattering Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory approach we derive solutions to the equations of motion for spinning massive bodies up to quadratic order in spins. At leading post-Minkowskian (PM) order these trajectories are obtained in the time domain, and at sub-leading order in the frequency domain. Our approach incorporates diagrammatic techniques and modern Feynman integration technologies, and includes a new family of loop integrals different to those seen in asymptotic PM calculations. Our results provide a new mechanism for computing the radiated angular momentum involved in gravitational scattering, which we reproduce at 2PM order up to linear spins. We have established a framework for computing higher-order effects to further extend the high-precision frontier in analytical gravitational wave physics, and push predictions for the radiated angular momentum to higher perturbative orders.</description>

      <title>Local-in-Time Conservative Binary Dynamics at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the local-in-time conservative dynamics of nonspinning binary systems at fifth Post-Minkowskian (5PM) and first self-force (1SF) orders. This follows from an explicit calculation of the 5PM/1SF nonlocal-in-time tail-type contribution to the deflection angle via worldline effective field theory techniques. Proceeding as in [2403.04853], we subtract the nonlocal tail terms from the result in [2403.07781] and reconstruct a local-in-time Hamiltonian in isotropic gauge -- valid for generic orbits. For completeness, we reinstate the nonlocal terms relevant for elliptic-like motion up to 6PN/1SF in a small-eccentricity expansion. Via the connection between the (source) energy flux in [2210.05541] and tail effects, we also derive the SF-exact logarithmic-dependent part of the full 5PM bound Hamiltonian. Our results provide the most accurate description to date of the dynamics of bound compact objects within the framework of relativistic scattering computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles has been made. The energy emission rate has also been analysed.</description>

      <title>Killing and homothetic initial data for general hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a collection of general identities relating the deformation tensor $\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{L}_{\eta}g$ of an arbitrary vector field $\eta$ with the tensor $\Sigma=\mathcal{L}_{\eta}\nabla$ on an abstract hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ of any causal character. As an application we establish necessary conditions on $\mathcal{H}$ for the existence of a homothetic Killing vector on the spacetime where $\mathcal{H}$ is embedded. The sufficiency of these conditions is then analysed in three specific settings. For spacelike hypersurfaces, we recover the well-known homothetic KID equations [10, 13] in the language of hypersurface data. For two intersecting null hypersurfaces, we generalize a previous result [7], valid for Killings, to the homothetic case and, moreover, demonstrate that the equations can be formulated solely in terms of the initial data for the characteristic Cauchy problem, i.e., without involving a priori spacetime quantities. This puts the characteristic KID problem on equal footing with the spacelike KID problem. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of the formalism by addressing the homothetic KID problem for smooth spacelike-characteristic initial data. Other initial value problems, such as the spacelike-characteristic with corners, can be approached similarly.</description>

      <title>One Membrane to Love them all: Tidal deformations of compact objects from the membrane paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tidal deformability is a key observable to test the nature of compact objects in a binary coalescence. Within vacuum General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of a four-dimensional black hole are strictly zero, while they are non-zero and model-dependent for material objects, matter distributions around black holes, or in alternative theories of gravity. Here, we develop a model-agnostic framework based on the membrane paradigm, where the tidal properties of a spherically symmetric object are encoded in the response of a fictitious membrane in terms of viscosity coefficients. We show that both neutron stars and exotic compact objects (in particular, we provide an explicit example for thin-shell gravastars) are included in this framework, provided that the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients of the membrane have a nontrivial frequency dependence. We derive a general result for the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers for non-rotating and spherically symmetric compact objects in terms of the viscosity coefficients, discussing their behavior with the compactness of the object, and identifying the conditions for the logarithmic behavior found in previous literature for various ultracompact objects. Finally, we show that the membrane shear viscosity coefficients associated with neutron star models feature novel quasi-universal relations, which depend only mildly on the neutron-star equation of state.</description>

Abstract: We discuss some of the issues that arise when considering the physics of asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes, and attempts to address them. Our development begins at the classical level, where several initial value problems are discussed, and ends with several proposals for holography in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. Throughout the paper we give a review of some basic notions such as the geometry of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, the Nariai limit, and quantum field theory in a fixed de Sitter background. We also briefly discuss some semiclassical aspects such as the nucleation of giant black holes and the Hartle-Hawking wavefunctional. We end by giving an overview of some open questions. An emphasis is placed on the differences between a static patch observer confined to live in a thermal cavity and the metaobserver who has access to a finite region of the future boundary.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the small sphere-limit for quasi-local energy we study local foliations of surfaces with prescribed mean curvature. Following the strategy used by Ye in 1991 to study local constant mean curvature foliations, we use a Lyapunov Schmidt reduction in an n+1 dimensional manifold equipped with a symmetric 2-tensor to construct the foliations around a point, prove their uniqueness and show their nonexistence conditions. To be specific, we study two foliation conditions. First we consider constant space-time mean curvature surfaces. These foliations were used by Cederbaum and Sakovich to characterize the center of mass in general relativity. Second, we study local foliations of constant expansion surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Local foliations of area constrained Willmore surfaces on a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold were constructed by Lamm, Metzger and Schulze, and Ikoma, Machiodi and Mondino, the leaves of these foliations are, in particular, critical surfaces of the Hawking energy in case they are contained in a totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface. We generalize these foliations to the general case of a non-totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface, constructing a unique local foliation of area constrained critical surfaces of the Hawking energy. A discrepancy when evaluating the so called small sphere limit of the Hawking energy was found by Friedrich. He studied concentrations of area constrained critical surfaces of the Hawking energy and obtained a result that apparently differs from the well established small sphere limit of the Hawking energy of Horowitz and Schmidt, this small sphere limit in principle must be satisfied by any quasi local energy. We independently confirm the discrepancy and explain the reasons for it to happen. We also prove that these surfaces are suitable to evaluate the Hawking energy in the sense of Lamm, Metzger and Schulze, and we find an indication that these surfaces may induce an excess in the energy measured.</description>

      <title>On the inefficiency of fermion level-crossing under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational chiral anomaly connects the topological charge of spacetime and the chirality of fermions. It has been known that the chirality is carried by the particles (or the excited states) and also by vacuum. While the gravitational anomaly equation has been applied to cosmology, distinction between these two contributions has been rarely discussed. In the study of gravitational leptogenesis, for example, lepton asymmetry associated with the chiral gravitational waves (GWs) sourced during inflation is evaluated only by integrating the anomaly equation. This approach, however, does not reveal how these two contributions are distributed in this scenario. Meanwhile, the dominance of vacuum contribution is observed in some specific types of Bianchi spacetime with parity-violating gravitational fields. One may wonder whether such a vacuum dominance takes place also in the system with chiral GWs around the flat background, which is more suitable for application to realistic cosmology. In this work, we apply an analogy between U(1) electromagnetism and the weak gravity to the spacetime that captures the characteristics of the one considered in the gravitational leptogenesis. With this approach, we try to obtain intuitive understanding of the fermion chirality generation under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field. By assuming the emergence of Landau level-like dispersion relation in our setup, we observe that spin-2 nature seems to make the level-crossing inefficient, indicating that the chrial charge is likely to accumulate in the vacuum. On this basis, phenomenological implications for gravitational leptogenesis are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum obesity (QO), quantum discord (QD), and the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) for bipartite Gisin states subjected to Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation of spacetime on the second qubit. These three quantifiers are introduced to characterize quantum correlations beyond entanglement and can also function as entanglement witnesses. Our results demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both QD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second qubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO stabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently increasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac field frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite trend is observed in the anti-particle region.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmic neutrino background on black hole superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the effect of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) on superradiant instabilities caused by an ultralight scalar field around spinning black holes (BHs). When the scalar couples to neutrinos via a Yukawa interaction, thermal corrections from the C$\nu$B induce a quartic self-interaction and an effective mass term for the scalar. We show that, for Yukawa couplings as small as $y_{\phi \nu} \sim 10^{-16}$ (for astrophysical BHs) or $10^{-20}$ (for supermassive BHs), the quartic term can quench the instability and set observable bounds, even if the scalar does not constitute dark matter. We assess the robustness of these constraints against several sources of uncertainty, including gravitational focusing of relic neutrinos, galactic clustering, and non-linear backreaction. An enhanced local neutrino density weakens the bounds by up to an order of magnitude compared to a uniform background, yet the induced self-interaction remains strong enough to significantly affect the superradiant dynamics. Our results open a new observational window on neutrino-coupled scalars via BH superradiance.</description>

Abstract: The mass window of ultralight axion dark matter motivated by suppressing the growth of structure on subgalactic scales, $m\sim 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, is now severely constrained by various observation data (e.g. Lyman-$\alpha$ forest). As an attempt to reopen this mass window, we investigate an alternative ultralight dark matter candidate, the complex scalar field dark matter (SFDM). We derive the relativistic hydrodynamics of the complex SFDM in the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. Our formalism contains two novel ingredients uniquely associated with the complex SFDM model: the Eckart frame defined by the conserved Noether current, and the stiff gauge condition, $c_s^2\equiv (\delta P/\delta\rho)|_s=1$. In the Eckart frame, the complex SFDM is effectively an imperfect fluid with a dissipative energy flux, distinguishing itself from axion dark matter. The energy flux can affect the growth of density fluctuations dynamically. Meanwhile, we apply the stiff gauge condition to find new constitutive equations for the complex SFDM. We revisit the homogeneous evolution of the complex SFDM and present illustrative early-stage solutions for perturbations of the complex SFDM in a simplified setting. We demonstrate the effects of varying the model parameters on the evolution of the perturbation variables.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Fiber Interferometer for Gravitational Phase Shift Measurement on Entangled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we describe the status of our experiment aimed at measuring the gravitationally induced phase shift on path-entangled photons. We use a kilometer-scale fiber interferometer whose arms are vertically displaced in the Earth gravitational potential, allowing photons propagating at different heights to accumulate different phases. To date, this is the first experiment to measure this effect on massless particles, thereby experimentally combining general relativity and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter isospectral Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the simplistic scenario where the measurements are assumed to be instantaneous, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>
