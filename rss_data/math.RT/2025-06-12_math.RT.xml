      <title>Koszulity for semi-infinite highest weight categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any upper finite or essentially finite highest weight category where the standard objects have linear projective resolutions and the costandard objects have linear injective resolutions is Koszul. This extends the result of Agoston, Dlab, and Lukacs to the case of infinite highest weight categories. We apply this result to Khovanov algebras and representations of classical Deligne categories and show that these are Koszul.</description>

      <title>Affine web of type Q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new diagrammatic $\Bbbk$-linear monoidal supercategory $QWeb^\bullet$, the affine web supercategory of type $Q$, where $\Bbbk$ is a commutative ring of characteristic not two. This category is the affinization of the web category of type $Q$, originally introduced by Brown and Kujawa. It serves as the type $Q$ analog of the affine web category introduced by Davidson, Kujawa, Muth and Zhu, and independently by Wang and one of the authors. We obtain diagrammatic integral bases for the Hom-spaces of this category. We show that $QWeb^\bullet$ provides a combinatorial model for a natural monoidal supercategory of endosuperfunctors for Lie superalgebras of type $Q$. .</description>

      <title>The Quantum Paldus Transform: Efficient Circuits with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Quantum Paldus Transform: an efficient quantum algorithm for block-diagonalising fermionic, spin-free Hamiltonians in the second quantisation. Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation number basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin (GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \times SU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and error mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur transform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion principle. Alongside self-contained derivations of the underlying dualities, we provide fault-tolerant circuit compilation methods for the Paldus transform with $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ Toffoli complexity, paving the way for significant advancements in quantum simulation on quantum computers enabled by the UGA paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological group is (openly) almost-elliptic if it contains a(n open) dense subset of elements generating relatively-compact cyclic subgroups. We classify the (openly) almost-elliptic connected locally compact groups as precisely those with compact maximal semisimple quotient and whose maximal compact subgroups act trivial-weight-freely on the Euclidean quotients of the closed derived series' successive layers. In particular, an extension of a compact connected group $\mathbb{K}$ by a connected, simply-connected solvable Lie group $\mathbb{L}$ is (openly) almost-elliptic precisely when the weights of the $\mathbb{K}$-action on $Lie(\mathbb{L})$ afforded by the extension are all non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Failure of Bott vanishing for (co)adjoint partial flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bott vanishing is a strong vanishing result for the cohomology of exterior powers of the cotangent bundle twisted by ample line bundles. Buch-Thomsen-Lauritzen-Mehta conjectured that partial flag varieties (which are not products of projective spaces) do not satisfy Bott vanishing, despite all their other nice properties. The cominuscule case is an easy application of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, following results of Snow. We show that the (co)adjoint partial flag varieties of all classical and exceptional Dynkin types also do not satisfy Bott vanishing, thus confirming the conjecture for this class of varieties.</description>

      <title>Level-Rank Dualities from $\Phi$-Cuspidal Pairs and Affine Springer Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the level-rank dualities arising from Uglov's work on higher-level Fock spaces. The statements use Hecke algebras defined by Brou\'{e}-Malle, which conjecturally describe the endomorphisms of Lusztig induction modules, and a generalization of Harish-Chandra theory due to Brou\'{e}-Malle-Michel. For any generic finite reductive group $\mathbb{G}$ and integers $e, m &gt; 0$, we conjecture that: (1) the intersection of a $\Phi_e$-Harish-Chandra series and a $\Phi_m$-Harish-Chandra series is parametrized by a union of blocks of the Hecke algebra of the $\Phi_e$-cuspidal pair at an $m$th root of unity, and similarly for the Hecke algebra of the $\Phi_m$-cuspidal pair at an $e$th root of unity; (2) these parametrizations match the blocks on the two sides; (3) when two blocks match, the bijection between them lifts to a derived equivalence between associated blocks of rational DAHAs. Surprisingly, these structures also appear in bimodules formed from the cohomology of affine Springer fibers studied by Oblomkov-Yun. When $\mathbb{G} = \mathbb{GL}_n$ and $e, m$ are coprime, we show that (1)-(3) hold, and that (3) recovers the level-rank dualities conjectured by Chuang-Miyachi and later proved through the work of several other people. Finally, we verify for many cases where $\mathbb{G}$ is exceptional that Brou\'{e}-Malle's parameters are numerically compatible with our conjectures.</description>

      <title>Atoms for signed permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.09805v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a natural analogue of weak Bruhat order on the involutions in any Coxeter group. The saturated chains of intervals in this order correspond to reduced words for a certain set of group elements called atoms. Brion gives a general formula for the cohomology class of a $K$-orbit closure in an arbitrary flag variety, where $K$ is a symmetric subgroup of a complex algebraic group. In type A, the terms in this formula are indexed by atoms for permutations. We study the combinatorics of atoms for involutions in the group of signed permutations. In particular, we give a compact description of the atom set for any signed involution and endow it with the structure of a graded poset. Our main result, as an application, is to identify explicitly the terms in Brion's cohomology formula in types B and C. These descriptions apply to all $K$-orbits in these types and are the first of their kind outside of type A.</description>

Abstract: For a split reductive group ${}^L G$ over a global field, we determine the spectrum of the spherical Hecke algebra coming from the unramified Eisenstein series for the minimal parabolic ${}^L B$. This is done using a certain decomposition of the Springer stack $T^*(B \backslash G/ B)$ for the Langlands dual group in the additive group of cobordisms of cohomologically proper derived quotient stacks.</description>

      <title>Weights of mod $p$ automorphic forms and partial Hasse invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a connected, reductive group $G$ over a finite field endowed with a cocharacter $\mu$, we define the zip cone of $(G,\mu)$ as the cone of all possible weights of mod $p$ automorphic forms on the stack of $G$-zips. This cone is conjectured to coincide with the cone of weights of characteristic $p$ automorphic forms for Hodge-type Shimura varieties of good reduction. We prove in full generality that the cone of weights of characteristic $0$ automorphic forms is contained in the zip cone, which gives further evidence to this conjecture. Furthermore, we determine exactly when the zip cone is generated by the weights of partial Hasse invariants, which is a group-theoretical generalization of a result of Diamond--Kassaei and Goldring--Koskivirta.</description>

      <title>Simple supercuspidal L-packets of split special orthogonal groups over dyadic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the split special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}_{N}$ defined over a $p$-adic field. We determine the structure of any $L$-packet of $\mathrm{SO}_{N}$ containing a simple supercuspidal representation (in the sense of Gross--Reeder). We also determine its endoscopic lift to a general linear group. Combined with the explicit local Langlands correspondence for simple supercuspidal representations of general linear groups, this leads us to get an explicit description of the $L$-parameter as a representation of the Weil group of $F$. Our result is new when $p=2$ and our method provides a new proof even when $p\neq2$.</description>

      <title>Deformations of ideals in Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops the deformation theory of Lie ideals. It shows that the smooth deformations of an ideal $\mathfrak i$ in a Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ differentiate to cohomology classes in the cohomology of $\mathfrak g$ with values in its adjoint representation on $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathfrak i, \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i)$. The cohomology associated with the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in $\mathfrak g$ is compared with other Lie algebra cohomologies defined by $\mathfrak i$, such as the cohomology defined by $\mathfrak i$ as a Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$ (Richardson, 1969), and the cohomology defined by the Lie algebra morphism $\mathfrak g \to \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i$.
  After a choice of complement of the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, its deformation complex is enriched to the differential graded Lie algebra that controls its deformations, in the sense that its Maurer-Cartan elements are in one-to-one correspondence with the (small) deformations of the ideal. Furthermore, the $L_{\infty}$-algebra that simultaneously controls the deformations of $\mathfrak{i}$ and of the ambient Lie bracket is identified.
  Under appropriate assumptions on the low degrees of the deformation cohomology of a given Lie ideal, the (topological) rigidity and stability of ideals are studied, as well as obstructions to deformations of ideals of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum knot invariants (like colored HOMFLY-PT or Kauffman polynomials) are a distinguished class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them (via Chern-Simons theory or quantum R-matrix) starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. Another set of knot invariants - of finite type - is related to quantum invariants via a perturbative expansion. However can all finite type invariants be obtained in this way? Investigating this problem, P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. Then it is easy to construct a polynomial $P_{alg}$ that vanishes for all simple Lie algebras, and the corresponding Vassiliev invariant would thus be absent from the perturbative expansion.
  We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebras might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie algebras - when we start from knot invariants and arrive at Lie algebras and their classification, which is opposite to conventional logic that we mentioned at the beginning.</description>

      <title>Twisted Steinberg algebras, regular inclusions and induction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a field $K$ and an ample (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $G$, we define the concept of a line bundle over $G$ inspired by the well known concept from the theory of C*-algebras. If $E$ is such a line bundle, we construct the associated twisted Steinberg algebra in terms of sections of $E$, extending the original construction introduced independently by Steinberg in 2010, and by Clark, Farthing, Sims and Tomforde in a 2014 paper (originally announced in 2011). We also generalize (strictly, in the non-Hausdorff case) the 2023 construction of (cocycle) twisted Steinberg algebras of Armstrong, Clark, Courtney, Lin, Mccormick and Ramagge. We then extend Steinberg's theory of induction of modules, not only to the twisted case, but to the much more general case of regular inclusions of algebras. Among our main results, we show that, under appropriate conditions, every irreducible module is induced by an irreducible module over a certain abstractly defined isotropy algebra. We also describe a process of disintegration of modules and use it to prove a version of the Effros-Hahn conjecture, showing that every primitive ideal coincides with the annihilator of a module induced from isotropy.</description>

Abstract: We introduce more general notions of Clifford codes and stabilizer codes, the latter we call weak stabilizer codes. This is all formulated in the language of projective representation theory of finite groups and we give a novel description of the detectable errors for a Clifford code. We give a complete characterization of when a Clifford code is also a weak stabilizer code in the case where the considered error model is a nice error basis. We also give examples of infinite families of non-stabilizer Clifford codes as well as examples of non-Clifford weak stabilizer codes. The latter of these types of examples is a class of codes that have not been studied in the same systematic framework as Clifford codes and stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>Spencer-Riemann-Roch Theory: Mirror Symmetry of Hodge Decompositions and Characteristic Classes in Constrained Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of mirror symmetry in compatible pair Spencer complex theory brings new theoretical tools to the study of constrained geometry. Inspired by classical Spencer theory and modern Hodge theory, this paper establishes Spencer-Riemann-Roch theory in the context of constrained geometry, systematically studying the mirror symmetry of Spencer-Hodge decompositions and their manifestations in algebraic geometry. We utilize Serre's GAGA principle to algebraic geometrize Spencer complexes, establish coherent sheaf formulations, and reveal the topological essence of mirror symmetry through characteristic class theory. Main results include: Riemann-Roch type Euler characteristic computation formulas for Spencer complexes, equivalence theorems for mirror symmetry of Hodge decompositions at the characteristic class level, and verification of these theories in concrete geometric constructions. Research shows that algebraic geometric methods can not only reproduce deep results from differential geometry, but also reveal the intrinsic structure of mirror symmetry in constrained geometry through characteristic class analysis, opening new directions for applications of Spencer theory in constrained geometry.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of the (multiple) fractional cohomological equation and, by studying its solutions, develop a novel framework to obtain the decay of matrix coefficients for partially hyperbolic algebraic actions. In particular, we show that mere partial H\"older regularity of \(L^2\) vectors is sufficient for exponential decay of matrix coefficients.
  As an application, under the assumption of ergodicity, we obtain explicit and sharp exponential mixing rates of all orders for a large class of partially hyperbolic algebraic actions. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of irrational automorphisms on nilmanifolds and prove that these automorphisms exhibit super-exponential mixing of all orders, marking the first such example in the literature.</description>
