      <title>Mathematics of multi-agent learning systems at the interface of game theory and artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two fields that, at first glance, might seem distinct, but they have notable connections and intersections. The former focuses on the evolution of behaviors (or strategies) in a population, where individuals interact with others and update their strategies based on imitation (or social learning). The more successful a strategy is, the more prevalent it becomes over time. The latter, meanwhile, is centered on machine learning algorithms and (deep) neural networks. It is often from a single-agent perspective but increasingly involves multi-agent environments, in which intelligent agents adjust their strategies based on feedback and experience, somewhat akin to the evolutionary process yet distinct in their self-learning capacities. In light of the key components necessary to address real-world problems, including (i) learning and adaptation, (ii) cooperation and competition, (iii) robustness and stability, and altogether (iv) population dynamics of individual agents whose strategies evolve, the cross-fertilization of ideas between both fields will contribute to the advancement of mathematics of multi-agent learning systems, in particular, to the nascent domain of ``collective cooperative intelligence'' bridging evolutionary dynamics and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Scale-free identity: The emergence of social network science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Network Analysis is a way of studying agents embedded in contexts. In about 1998, physicists discovered social networks as representations of complex systems. Small-world and scale-free networks are the paradigmatic models of this Network Science. Relying on various models and mechanisms of socio-cultural processes, an identity model is developed and calibrated in a case study of Social Network Science. This research domain results from the union of Social Network Analysis and Network Science. A unique dataset of 25,760 scholarly articles from one century of research (1916-2012) is created. Clustering this set of publications, five subdomains are detected and analyzed in terms of authorship, citation, and word usage structures and dynamics. The scaling hypothesis of percolation theory is formulated for socio-cultural systems, namely that power-law size distributions like Lotka's, Bradford's, and Zipf's Law mean that the described identity resides at the phase transition between the stability and change of meaning. In this case, it can be diagnosed using bivariate scaling laws and Abbott's heuristic of fractal distinctions. Identities are not dichotomies but dualities of social network and cultural domain, micro and macro phenomena, as well as stability and change. Story sets that give direction to research fluctuate less, are less distinctive, and more inert than the individuals doing the research. Identities are scale-free. Six senses are diagnostic of different aspects of identity, and when they come together as process, a complex socio-cultural system comes into existence. A mutual benefit that results from mating Relational Sociology and Network Science is identified. The latter can learn from the former that social systems are dualities of transactions and meaning. For the social sciences, the importance of Paretian thinking (scale invariance) is pointed out.</description>

      <title>Monocentric or polycentric city? An empirical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do cities have just one or several centers? Studies performing radial or monocentric analyses of cities are usually criticised by researchers stating that cities are actually polycentric, and this has been well known for a long time. Reversely, when cities are studied independently of any center, other researchers will wonder how the variables of interest evolve with the distance to the center, because this distance is known to be a major determinant at the intra-urban scale. Both monocentric and polycentric formalisms have been introduced centuries (respectively, decades) ago for the study of urban areas, and used both on the empirical and the theoretical side in different disciplines (economics, geography, complex systems, physics...). The present work performs a synthesis of both viewpoints on cities, regarding their use in the literature, and explores with data on European urban areas how some cities considered to be the most polycentric in Europe compare to more standard cities when studied through a combination of radial analysis and scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Feasible climate policies in a democracy with a climate-denying party</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate policy has become increasingly politicized in many countries including the US, with some political parties unwilling to pursue strong measures. Therefore, to be successful in mitigation, climate policies must be politically feasible. Currently, climate mitigation pathways are explored in so-called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which evaluate climate policies from an economic perspective, typically focusing on cost-effectiveness and overlooking transition costs. However, the economy is intertwined with the political system, in which policymakers impose economic policies, but are (in democracies) dependent on public opinion, which in turn can be influenced by economic performance. In cases where some parties are much less ambitious in climate mitigation than others, climate policy can be abruptly disrupted, influencing voting behaviour. In this study, we analyze the political feasibility of a set of green policies in case some parties are strongly unwilling to protect the climate. We show that this simple additional social layer of complexity largely affects the outcome of the abatement measures. In particular, we conclude that a (high) pure carbon tax is particularly vulnerable to abrupt interruptions and its economic side effects discourage votes for green parties. Nevertheless, a strategically selected combination of policies can reduce political uncertainty, resulting in a more feasible and effective mitigation measure.</description>

      <title>A Science4Peace initiative: Alleviating the consequences of sanctions in international scientific cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The armed invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has adversely affected the relations between Russia and Western countries. Among other aspects, it has put scientific cooperation and collaboration into question and changed the scientific landscape significantly. Cooperation between some Western institutions and their Russian and Belarusian partners were put on hold after February 24, 2022. The CERN Council decided at its meeting in December 2023 to terminate cooperation agreements with Russia and Belarus that date back a decade. CERN is an international institution with UN observer status, and has so far played a role in international cooperation which was independent of national political strategies. We argue that the Science4Peace idea still has a great value and scientific collaboration between scientists must continue, since fundamental science is by its nature an international discipline. A ban of scientists participating in international cooperation and collaboration is against the traditions, requirements and understanding of science. We call for measures to reactivate the peaceful cooperation of individual scientists on fundamental research in order to stimulate international cooperation for a more peaceful world in the future. Specifically, we plead for finding ways to continue this cooperation through international organizations, such as CERN and JINR.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Complex Networks with Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While renormalization groups are fundamental in physics, renormalization of complex networks remains vague in its conceptual definition and methodology. Here, we propose a novel strategy to renormalize complex networks. Rather than resorting to handling the bare structure of a network, we overlay it with a readily renormalizable physical model, which reflects real-world scenarios with a broad generality. From the renormalization of the overlying system, we extract a rigorous and simple renormalization group transformation of arbitrary networks. In this way, we obtain a transparent, model-dependent physical meaning of the network renormalization, which in our case is a scale transformation preserving the transition dynamics of low-density particles. We define the strength of a node in accordance with the physical model and trace the change of its distribution under our renormalization process. This analysis demonstrates that the strength distributions of scale-free networks remain scale-invariant, whereas those of homogeneous random networks do not.</description>

      <title>Signed graphs in data sciences via communicability geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signed graphs are an emergent way of representing data in a variety of contexts were conflicting interactions exist. These include data from biological, ecological, and social systems. Here we propose the concept of communicability geometry for signed graphs, proving that metrics in this space, such as the communicability distance and angles, are Euclidean and spherical. We then apply these metrics to solve several problems in data analysis of signed graphs in a unified way. They include the partitioning of signed graphs, dimensionality reduction, finding hierarchies of alliances in signed networks as well as the quantification of the degree of polarization between the existing factions in systems represented by this type of graphs.</description>

      <title>How Language, Culture, and Geography shape Online Dialogue: Insights from Koo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koo is a microblogging platform based in India launched in 2020 with the explicit aim of catering to non-Western communities in their vernacular languages. With a near-complete dataset totalling over 71M posts and 399M user interactions, we show how Koo has attracted users from several countries including India, Nigeria and Brazil, but with variable levels of sustained user engagement. We highlight how Koo's interaction network has been shaped by multiple country-specific migrations and displays strong divides between linguistic and cultural communities, for instance, with English-speaking communities from India and Nigeria largely isolated from one another. Finally, we analyse the content shared by each linguistic community and identify cultural patterns that promote similar discourses across language groups. Our study raises the prospect that a multilingual and politically diverse platform like Koo may be able to cultivate vernacular communities that have, historically, not been prioritised by US-based social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Effects of heterogeneous opinion interactions in many-agent systems for epidemic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we define a kinetic model for understanding the impact of heterogeneous opinion formation dynamics on epidemics. The considered many-agent system is characterized by nonsymmetric interactions which define a coupled system of kinetic equations for the evolution of the opinion density in each compartment. In the quasi-invariant limit we may show positivity and uniqueness of the solution of the problem together with its convergence towards an equilibrium distribution exhibiting bimodal shape. The tendency of the system towards opinion clusters is further analyzed by means of numerical methods, which confirm the consistency of the kinetic model with its moment system whose evolution is approximated in several regimes of parameters.</description>

      <title>Simulating Opinion Dynamics with Networks of LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately simulating human opinion dynamics is crucial for understanding a variety of societal phenomena, including polarization and the spread of misinformation. However, the agent-based models (ABMs) commonly used for such simulations often over-simplify human behavior. We propose a new approach to simulating opinion dynamics based on populations of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our findings reveal a strong inherent bias in LLM agents towards producing accurate information, leading simulated agents to consensus in line with scientific reality. This bias limits their utility for understanding resistance to consensus views on issues like climate change. After inducing confirmation bias through prompt engineering, however, we observed opinion fragmentation in line with existing agent-based modeling and opinion dynamics research. These insights highlight the promise and limitations of LLM agents in this domain and suggest a path forward: refining LLMs with real-world discourse to better simulate the evolution of human beliefs.</description>
