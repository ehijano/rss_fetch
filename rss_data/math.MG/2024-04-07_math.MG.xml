      <title>Minimal hyperbolic polynomials and ranks of homogeneous cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The starting point of this paper is the computation of minimal hyperbolic polynomials of duals of cones arising from chordal sparsity patterns. From that, we investigate the relation between ranks of homogeneous cones and their minimal polynomials. Along the way, we answer in the negative a question posed in an earlier paper and show examples of homogeneous cones that cannot be realized as rank-one generated (ROG) hyperbolicity cones.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Theta Series over Unimodular Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theta series of a lattice has been extensively studied in the literature and is closely related to a critical quantity widely used in the fields of physical layer security and cryptography, known as the flatness factor, or equivalently, the smoothing parameter of a lattice. Both fields raise the fundamental question of determining the (globally) maximum theta series over a particular set of volume-one lattices, namely, the stable lattices. In this work, we present a property of unimodular lattices, a subfamily of stable lattices, to verify that the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ achieves the largest possible value of theta series over the set of unimodular lattices. Such a result moves towards proving a conjecture recently stated by Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz: any unimodular lattice, except for those lattices isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, has a strictly smaller theta series than that of $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. Our techniques are mainly based on studying the ratio of the theta series of a unimodular lattice to the theta series of $\mathbb{Z}^n$, called the secrecy ratio. We relate the Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz conjecture with another conjecture for unimodular lattices, known in the literature as the Belfiore-Sol\'e conjecture. The latter assumes that the secrecy ratio of any unimodular lattice has a symmetry point, which is exactly where the global minimum of the secrecy ratio is achieved.</description>

      <title>Coarse geometry of quasi-transitive graphs beyond planarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study geometric and topological properties of infinite graphs that are quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph excluding a minor is quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We use the result to give a simple proof of the result that finitely generated minor-excluded groups have Assouad-Nagata dimension at most 2 (this is known to hold in greater generality, but all known proofs use significantly deeper tools). We also prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph that is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is $k$-planar for some $k$ (i.e. it has a planar drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge), and discuss a possible approach to prove the converse statement.</description>
