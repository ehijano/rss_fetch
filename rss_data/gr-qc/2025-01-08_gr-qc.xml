      <title>Spherically symmetric electrically counterpoised dust either collapses or disperses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamical evolution of spherically symmetric objects made of electrically counterpoised dust in general relativity. It has been claimed that these objects are in neutral equilibrium and, therefore, that black hole mimickers made of electrically counterpoised dust are feasible. Here we show that if a velocity is imparted to the fluid elements, no matter how small, the evolution leads either to a black hole or to the dispersion of the fluid. Furthermore, in the case of collapse, the resulting object is necessarily an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole.</description>

      <title>Testing general covariance in effective models motivated by Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a criterion for testing general covariance in effective quantum gravity theories. It adapts the criterion based on general spacetime diffeomorphisms of the Einstein-Hilbert action to the case of effective canonical models. While the main purpose is to test models obtained in Loop Quantum Gravity, the criterion is not limited to those physical systems and may be applied to any canonically formulated modified theory of gravity. The approach here is hence not that of finding an effective model, but rather to analyze a given one represented by a quantum corrected Hamiltonian. Specifically, we will apply the criterion to spherically symmetric spacetimes in the vacuum with inverse triad and holonomy modifications that arise as a consequence of the loop quantization procedure. It is found that, in addition to the initial modifications of the Hamiltonian, quantum corrections of the classical metric itself are needed as well in order to obtain generally covariant models. A comparison with a recent alternative criterion is included in the discussion.</description>

      <title>Complex Riemannian spacetime and singularity-free black holes and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approach is presented to address singularities in general relativity using a complex Riemannian spacetime extension. We demonstrate how this method can be applied to both black hole and cosmological singularities, specifically focusing on the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes and the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Big Bang cosmology. By extending the relevant coordinates into the complex plane and carefully choosing integration contours, we show that it is possible to regularize these singularities, resulting in physically meaningful, singularity-free solutions when projected back onto real spacetime. This approach offers a potential bridge between classical general relativity and quantum gravity effects, suggesting a way to resolve longstanding issues in gravitational physics without requiring a full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of charged warm holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged black holes are known to suffer from an interior instability associated with the presence of the Cauchy horizon. Recently, a hairy charged black hole was proposed that avoids the formation of a Cauchy horizon. It is natural to question whether this instability might manifest in the exterior solution. In this paper, we have analyzed the stability of this black hole. Our results show that vector perturbations are stable, along with the scalar sector for $l=0$. We have also computed the corresponding quasinormal modes (QNMs) and quasibound states (QBSs). Among the six degrees of freedom identified, one exhibits a ghost-like behavior. However, this mode decouples from the other perturbations, rendering the associated instability irrelevant in the linear regime. Nonetheless, this feature could indicate a more significant issue in the nonlinear regime.</description>

      <title>Weak deflection angle of charged signal in magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the perturbative method to study the influence of the magnetic field on the weak deflection angle of charged signals in magnetized stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes within general electromagnetic potentials. The deflection angle is expressed as a series expansion of the inverse of the impact parameter $b$, with coefficients determined by the asymptotic expansions of the metric functions and the electromagnetic four-potential. It is found that in general, the deflection angle can always be separated into two parts, the usual gravitational part as for neutral particles, and the electromagnetic part due to the interaction between the (electro)magnetic field and the signal. The leading order of the gravitational, electrostatic (from nonzero spacetime charge) and magnetic (from nonzero magnetic dipole moment) contributions are $b^{-1},\,b^{-1}$ and $b^{-2}$ respectively. The entire electromagnetic part is enhanced by the large specific charge of elementary particles but suppressed by the reciprocal Lorentz factor. The deflection angle result is then applied to three spacetimes with intrinsic or externally enforced magnetic fields. Effects of the magnetic field on the deflection angle from various parameters, including the spacetime spin, magnetic dipole moment and magnetic parameters, are analyzed. In all these cases, it is found that in the weak deflection limit, these effects agree with the expectation for a Lorentz force; that is, an attractive (or repulsive) one will enlarge (or decrease) the deflection angle.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Isotropization based Extended Models in the context of Electromagnetic Field: An Implication of Minimal Gravitational Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper formulates three different analytical solutions to the gravitational field equations in the framework of Rastall theory by taking into account the gravitational decoupling approach. For this, the anisotropic spherical interior fluid distribution is assumed as a seed source characterized by the corresponding Lagrangian. The field equations are then modified by introducing an additional source which is gravitationally coupled with the former fluid setup. Since this approach makes the Rastall equations more complex, the MGD scheme is used to tackle this, dividing these equations into two systems. Some particular ansatz are taken into account to solve the first system, describing initial anisotropic fluid. These metric potentials contain multiple constants which are determined with the help of boundary conditions. On the other hand, the solution for the second set is calculated through different well-known constraints. Afterwards, the estimated data of a pulsar $4U 1820-30$ is considered so that the feasibility of the developed models can be checked graphically. It is concluded that all resulting models show physically acceptable behavior under certain choices of Rastall and decoupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Compact Object without Cauchy Horizons in Effective Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study strong gravitational lensing effects of a static, spherically symmetric solution in the context of effective quantum gravity (EQG). Among the three types of solutions proposed in EQG backgrounds, this is the third type without having Cauchy horizons. This solution gives rise to black hole as well as horizonless wormhole solutions depending on the range of values of the quantum parameter. Based on the data from SgrA* and M87* observations, possible bounds on the quantum parameter are obtained. It is found that the horizonless wormhole solutions are rule out by SgrA* observations but allowed by M87* observations. We analyze the lensing features of light in the strong deflection limit and evaluate various lensing observables both in the context of black hole and wormhole cases, and specifically study the effects of the quantum parameter on the them. It is shown that with increase of the quantum parameter, time delay between the first two relativistic images increases. Since its value comes out to be of the order of several days in the context of M87*, futuristic precision measurements of time delay may become important to specify parameters of background geometry more accurately.</description>

      <title>General spherically symmetric black bounces within non-linear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last years, the search of new regular black bounce solutions has drawn a lot of attentional over the international community working in gravitation. Indeed, in the era of gravitational waves detections out of binary mergers and of the imaging of the plasma around supermassive black holes, the study of everywhere regular solutions has become a common trend given the unique opportunity posed by multi-messenger astronomy to test deviations from the Kerr family of solutions. Among them, in this paper we consider the black bounce paradigm introduced by Simpson and Visser in [JCAP \textbf{02}, 042 (2019)], and provide a general procedure for reconstructing static spherically symmetric black bounce-type solutions that might interpolate between regular black holes and wormholes. We show that even after imposing some smoothness and flatness conditions on the metric components, additional analysis is required to obtain a well-defined black bounce solution. Then, the corresponding matter Lagrangian is reconstructed by using non-linear electrodynamics and the energy conditions are studied.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach which implements the relativistic calculations of the photon travel time into a robust timing model for pulsars orbiting supermassive black holes. We demonstrate the inability of current timing codes based on the post-Newtonian expansion of General Relativity to correctly estimate the relativistic time of arrival of the emitted pulses at an Earth-based observatory. We also show how a misestimation of the pulsar parameters can lead to the appearance of phase-dependent residual, which hints at a tremendous constraining power of the binary and intrinsic parameters for timing observations of potential pulsars at the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Transverse expansion of the metric at null hypersurfaces II. Existence results and application to Killing horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper finishes the series of two papers that we started with [arXiv:2405.05377], where we analyzed the transverse expansion of the metric at a general null hypersurface. While [arXiv:2405.05377] focused on uniqueness results, here we show existence of ambient manifolds given the full asymptotic expansion at the null hypersurface. When such expansion fulfills a set of "constraint equations" we prove that the ambient manifold solves the Einstein equations to infinite order at the hypersurface. Our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the dimension or topology of the null hypersurface and is entirely covariant. Furthermore, when the hypersurface exhibits a product topology we find the minimum amount of data on a cross-section that ensures the existence of an ambient space solving the Einstein equations to infinite order on the hypersurface. As an application we recall the notion of abstract Killing horizon data (AKH) introduced in [arXiv:2405.05377], namely the minimal data needed to define a non-degenerate Killing horizon from a detached viewpoint, and we prove that every AKH of arbitrary dimension and topology gives rise to an ambient space solving the {\Lambda}-vacuum equations to infinite order and with the given data as Killing horizon. Our result also includes the possibility of the Killing vector having zeroes at the horizon.</description>

      <title>Quantum Perspectivism vs Nietzschean Perspectivism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a work of hard physical philosophy, where Quantum Perspectivism is shown to function as both an interpretation of quantum mechanics and a physical model for understanding Nietzsche's perspectivism. This framework combines quantum logic, the principle of complementarity, and contextuality to examine how perspectives construct reality. In this model, measurements correspond to Perspectives and Meta-Perspectives, represented as Boolean subalgebras and Hilbert sub-lattices within the Hilbert lattice, respectively. The Hilbert lattice itself is reinterpreted as Jung's Unus Mundus, a unified ontological reality. A metaphysical observation, made by a metaphysical observer, of a given system (World) is identified with the set of all corresponding meta-perspectives in the Hilbert lattice/Unus Mundus, the ocean of reality.
  Perspectives, likened to islands in this ocean, correspond to single measurements of a system, capturing the logical structure of observed properties. Meta-perspectives, analogous to continents, represent the synthesis of multiple measurements, providing a broader yet inherently incomplete understanding of the system. This structure emphasizes the complementarity and contextual dependencies of measurements while exposing the limitations of classical objectivity in the quantum domain. Advocating for a perspectival view of both the world and truth, Quantum Perspectivism unites quantum mechanics and Nietzschean philosophy into a cohesive framework for exploring the interplay between consciousness, observation, and reality.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbation Theory with Trinity of Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explicitly develops the three-field cosmological perturbation theory with a flat field space. We solve the background and perturbation equations numerically for three different cases. First, to check the consistency of the three-field formalism, we investigate an effective two-field model motivated by the two-block case of the multi-giant vacua matrix Inflation model. Then we investigate a completely three-field case without any direct interaction between different fields, and finally, a three-field case containing direct interactions. The power spectra of the curvature perturbations in all cases are computed numerically, and the effects of rapid turn in the power spectrum are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Science Opportunities of Wet Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the gas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Unlike "dry EMRIs", which form through gravitational scattering in nuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with accretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are distinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion disk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented precision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and spin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering insights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and dark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of Hubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association. These systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black hole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Modelling noise in gravitational-wave observatories with transdimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling noise in gravitational-wave observatories is crucial for accurately inferring the properties of gravitational-wave sources. We introduce a transdimensional Bayesian approach to characterise the noise in ground-based gravitational-wave observatories using the Bayesian inference software $\texttt{Bilby}$. The algorithm models broadband noise with a combination of power laws; narrowband features with Lorentzians; and shapelets to capture any additional features in the data. We show that our noise model provides a significantly improved fit of the LIGO and Virgo noise amplitude spectral densities compared to currently available noise fits obtained with on-source data segments. We perform astrophysical inference on well-known events in the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog using our noise model and observe shifts of up to $7\%$ in the $90\%$ boundaries of credible intervals for some parameters. We discuss plans to deploy this framework systematically for gravitational-wave inference along with possible areas of improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing precision sensors for stochastic signals using quantum techniques is a promising emerging field of physics. Estimating a weak stochastic waveform is the core task of many fundamental physics experiments including searches for stochastic gravitational waves, quantum gravity, and axionic dark matter. Simultaneously, noise spectroscopy and characterisation, e.g. estimation of various decay mechanisms in quantum devices, is relevant to a broad range of fundamental and technological applications. We consider the ultimate limit on the sensitivity of these devices for Lindblad estimation given any quantum state, fast and precise control sequence, and measurement scheme. We show that it is optimal to rapidly projectively measure and re-initialise the quantum state. We develop optimal protocols for a wide range of applications including stochastic waveform estimation, spectroscopy with qubits, and Lindblad estimation.</description>

Abstract: We find the non-extremal charged rotating black holes in quadratic $f(T)$ gravity are holographically dual to two different hidden conformal field theories. The two conformal field theories can be merged to find a very general hidden conformal field theory, which is generated by the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular group. We also carry out the the calculation to the extremal limit of the black holes, and find the corresponding dual quantities. Contrary to the existence of two different dual conformal field theories for the extremal charged rotating black holes in Einstein gravity, we find only one dual theory exists for the extremal charged rotating black holes in quadratic $f(T)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscous matter in $f(T)$ gravity: A path to cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of varying bulk viscosity coefficients $\zeta(t)=\zeta_{0}+\zeta_{1}H$ on cosmic evolution within the framework of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. We focus on two cases: (i) $\zeta_{1} \neq0$ and (ii) $\zeta_{1} =0$, deriving the Hubble parameter $H$ as a function of redshift $z$ using a linear $f(T)$ model ($f(T) = \alpha T$ where $\alpha \neq 0$). Using the combined $H(z)+Pantheon^{+}+BAO$ dataset, we obtain observational constraints on model parameters. For Case I ($\zeta_1 \neq 0$), best-fit values are $H_0=60.0^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=1.01^{+0.10}_{-0.098}$, $\zeta_0=40.1^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$, and $\zeta_1=0.123^{+0.093}_{-0.088}$, while for Case II ($\zeta_1 = 0$), they are $H_0=67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.3}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=0.94^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$, and $\zeta_0=34.7^{+2.0}_{-2.0}$. The analysis reveals a transition in the deceleration parameter, indicating a shift from deceleration to acceleration of the universe's expansion, with present-day values of $q_{0} \approx -0.49$ and $q_{0} \approx -0.32$ for the respective cases. The jerk parameter $j(z)$ and effective EoS for the cosmic viscous fluid also support the cosmic acceleration, with trajectories aligning with the quintessence scenario. These findings underscore the potential of our $f(T)$ model dominated by bulk viscous matter in explaining cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM Model Against Gravity-Thermodynamics Conjecture: Observational Constraints After DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture based on the Tsallis entropy-area relation, we investigate the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and examine some potential deviations from it. Utilizing recent updates from geometrical datasets, including the DESI BAO measurements (2024), Planck CMB anisotropy measurements (2018), and the Pantheon+ catalogue for SNIa (2022), we conduct a thorough analysis via the window of Tsallis cosmology. In the first step, our analysis reveals no significant deviation from the standard model when using DESI BAO data alone, Pantheon+ data alone, or a combination of both. In the next step, we incorporate all datasets by adding the CMB data to our analysis, indicating a potential deviation from the standard model within the framework of Tsallis cosmology. Imposing the Planck prior to the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch, we observe support for the standard model and consistency between our constraints on the Hubble constant and the Planck value. Finally, we compare the Tsallis and $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).</description>

      <title>Foliated Asymptotically Safe Gravity -- Lorentzian Signature Fluctuations from the Wick Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety constitutes a promising mechanism for a consistent and predictive high-energy completion of the gravitational interactions. To date, most results on the interacting renormalization group fixed point underlying the construction are obtained for Euclidean signature spacetimes. In this work, we use the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) decomposition of the metric degrees of freedom and investigate the relations between the Euclidean and Lorentzian renormalization group flows resulting from the analytic continuation of the lapse function. We discuss the general conditions which guarantee the equivalence of the beta functions. These insights are illustrated based on the flow of the graviton two-point function within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation, demonstrating agreement of the Euclidean and Lorentzian settings. Hence the UV- and IR-completions identified in the Euclidean case are robust when changing spacetime signature. We take this as an important indicator that the Euclidean asymptotic safety mechanism carries over to Lorentzian signature spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators for relativistic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to review developments regarding the use of ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators. Special emphasis is placed on relativistic quantum phenomena, which are presumably most interesting for the audience of this journal. After a brief introduction into the main idea of quantum simulators and the basic physics of ultra-cold atoms, relativistic quantum phenomena of linear fields are discussed, including Hawking radiation, the Unruh effect, cosmological particle creation, the Gibbons-Hawking and Ginzburg effects, super-radiance, Sauter-Schwinger and Breit-Wheeler pair creation, as well as the dynamical Casimir effect. After that, the focus is shifted to phenomena of non-linear fields, such as the sine-Gordon model, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, false-vacuum decay, and quantum back-reaction. In order to place everything into proper context, the basic underlying mechanisms of these phenomena are briefly recapitulated before their simulators are discussed. Even though effort is made to provide a review as fair as possible, there can be co claim of completeness and the selection as well as the relative weights of the topics may well reflect some personal bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the energy-entropy ratio inequality in quantum field theory (QFT) established by one of us from localized states to a larger class of states. The states considered in this paper can be in a charged (non-vacuum) representation of the QFT or may be only approximately localized in the region under consideration. Our inequality is $S(\Psi |\!| \Omega) \le 2\pi R \, ( \Psi, H_\rho \Psi ) + \log d(\rho) + \varepsilon$, where $S$ is the relative entropy, where $R$ is a "radius" (width) characterizing the size of the region, $d(\rho)$ is the statistical (quantum) dimension of the given charged sector $\rho$ hosting the quantum state $\Psi$, $\Omega$ is the vacuum state, $H_\rho$ is the Hamiltonian in the charged sector, and $\varepsilon$ is a tolerance measuring the deviation of $\Psi$ from the vacuum according to observers in the causal complement of the region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of two massive particles with a quantised gravitational field in its vacuum state using two different position observables: (i) a frame-dependent coordinate separation and (ii) a frame-independent geodesic separation. For free particles, (i) leads to purely unitary dynamics but (ii) leads to dissipation. For two particles coupled through a linear spring, (i) and (ii) lead to different cut-off dependences in the frequency shift harmonic ladder of the differential motional mode. Our findings highlight the subtle consequences of different position observables at the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scalar Field Dynamics On A Maximally Sliced Two-sided AdS Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semi-classical dynamics of a scalar field in the background of a black hole in an asymptotically AdS (AAdS) spacetime, in the framework of the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity. The small diffeomorphism (gauge) symmetries generated by the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints are completely fixed by the maximal slicing and spatial harmonic/Dirac gauge conditions after which the residual phase space degrees of freedom are gauge invariant. While many of our results are valid for AAdS$_{d+1}$ spacetimes, we mainly discuss the $d=2$ case of the static BTZ solution. We present the explicit solution for the smooth maximal slicing of the fully extended BTZ solution where the spatial slices cut across the horizons, asymptote to the usual Schwarzschild slices, do not include the past and future singularities, and for which the lapse remains non-zero at the bifurcate point. We also derive unique large diffeomorphisms that asymptote to time translations on both boundaries in the maximal slicing gauge.
  We present the solution of the scalar field wave equation in this gauge in terms of its boundary values which correspond to boundary CFT operators by the AdS/CFT dictionary. We explicitly construct the finite, time-dependent Hamiltonian in terms of a discrete set of mode functions of the scalar field that are smooth and differentiable across the horizons of the fully extended BTZ black hole. These modes mix the boundary operators from the two sides and are appropriate linear combinations of the Hartle-Hawking-Unruh modes. This Hamiltonian is an operator in the product of the two CFTs associated to the two boundaries and describes the time evolution of CFT operators. Our results are valid for evolution times smaller than the scrambling time during which the fully extended BTZ solution continues to be a valid saddle point of the quantum gravity path integral.</description>

      <title>Improving the detection sensitivity to primordial stochastic gravitational waves with reduced astrophysical foregrounds. II. Subthreshold binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) consist of a primordial component from early Universe processes and an astrophysical component from compact binary mergers. To detect the primordial stochastic GW background (SGWB), the astrophysical foregrounds must be reduced to high precision, which is achievable for third-generation (3G) ground based GW detectors. Previous studies have shown that the foreground from individually detectable merger events can be reduced with fractional residual energy density below $10^{-3}$, and the residual foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNSs) will be the bottleneck if not well cleaned. In this work, we propose that the foreground energy density of subthreshold BNSs $\Omega_{\rm sub}$ can be estimated via a population based approach from the individually detectable BNSs utilizing the isotropic orbital orientations of all BNSs, i.e., uniform distribution in $\cos\iota$, where $\iota$ is the BNS inclination angle with respect to the line of sight. Using this approach, we find $\Omega_{\rm sub}$ can be measured with percent-level uncertainty, assuming $O(10^5)$ individually detected BNSs in our simulations. This method represents a promising approach to tackling the foreground cleaning problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest of a physical theory of quantum gravity, spin foam models, or in short spinfoams, propose a well-defined path integral summing over quantized discrete space-time geometries. At the crossroad of topological quantum field theory, dynamical triangulations, Regge calculus, and loop quantum gravity, this framework provides a non-perturbative and background independent quantization of general relativity. It defines transition amplitudes between quantum states of geometry, and gives a precise picture of the Planck scale geometry with quantized areas and volumes. Gravity in three space-time dimensions is exactly quantized in terms of the Ponzano-Regge state-sum and Turaev-Viro topological invariants. In four space-time dimensions, gravity is formulated as a topological theory, of the BF type, with extra constraints, and hence quantized as a topological state-sum filled with defects. This leads to the Engle-Pereira-Rovelli-Livine (EPRL) spinfoam model, that can be used for explicit quantum gravity computations, for example for resolving the Big Bang singularity by a bounce or in black-to-white hole transition probability amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Transdimensional inference for gravitational-wave astronomy with Bilby</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has become increasingly useful to answer questions in gravitational-wave astronomy using transdimensional models where the number of free parameters can be varied depending on the complexity required to fit the data. Given the growing interest in transdimensional inference, we introduce a new package for the Bayesian inference Library (Bilby) called tBilby. The tBilby package allows users to set up transdimensional inference calculations using the existing Bilby architecture with off-the-shelf nested samplers and/or Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Transdimensional models are particularly helpful when we seek to test theoretically uncertain predictions described by phenomenological models. For example, bursts of gravitational waves can be modelled using a superposition of N wavelets where N is itself a free parameter. Short pulses are modelled with small values of N whereas longer, more complicated signals are represented with a large number of wavelets stitched together. Other transdimensional models have found use describing instrumental noise and the population properties of gravitational-wave sources. We provide a few demonstrations of tBilby, including fitting the gravitational-wave signal GW150914 with a superposition of N sine-Gaussian wavelets. We outline our plans to further develop the tbilby code suite for a broader range of transdimensional problems.</description>

Abstract: In this work we explore some aspects of the spectral instability of back hole quasi-normal modes, using a specific model as an example. The model is that of a small bump perturbation to the effective potential of linear axial gravitational waves on a Schwarzschild background, and our focus is on three different aspects of the instability: identifying and distinguishing between the two different types of instabilities studied previously in the literature, quantifying the size of the perturbations applied to the system and testing the validity of the pseudospectral numerical method in providing a convergent result for this measure, and finally, relating the size and other features of the perturbation to the degree of destabilisation of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>A third law of black hole mechanics for supersymmetric black holes and a quasi-local mass-charge inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that a third law of black hole mechanics does not hold for Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a massless charged scalar field: there exist solutions that describe gravitational collapse to form an exactly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in finite time. In this paper it is proved that such solutions do not exist in theories with matter fields satisfying a local mass-charge inequality. In such a theory, if a 2-surface has the same metric, extrinsic curvature, and Maxwell field as a cross-section of an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om horizon then this surface cannot have a compact interior and so cannot be a horizon cross-section of a black hole formed in gravitational collapse. This result is proved using spinorial techniques, which are also used to prove a mass-charge inequality for a modified version of the Dougan-Mason quasi-local mass.</description>

      <title>Orbital eccentricity in general relativity from catastrophe theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the orbital eccentricity is a key feature of the gravitational two-body problem, providing an unambiguous definition in general relativity poses significant challenges. Despite such foundational issue, the eccentricity of binary black holes has important implications in gravitational-wave astronomy. We present a novel approach to consistently define the orbital eccentricity in general relativity, grounded in the mathematical field of catastrophe theory. Specifically, we identify the presence of catastrophes, i.e., breakdowns of the stationary-phase approximation, in numerical relativity waveforms and exploit them to develop a robust and fully gauge-invariant estimator of the eccentricity. Our procedure does not require orbital fitting and naturally satisfies the Newtonian limit. The proposed eccentricity estimator agrees with and generalizes a previous proposal, though with a fully independent derivation. We extract gauge-free eccentricity estimates from about 100 numerical relativity simulations and find that the resulting values are systematically lower compared to those reported alongside the simulations themselves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum and classical descriptions of gravitational wave detection in interferometers like LIGO. We demonstrate that a graviton scattering and quantum optics model succeeds in explaining the observed arm displacements, while the classical gravitational wave approach and a quantum graviton energy method also successfully predict the correct results. We provide a detailed analysis of why the quantum graviton energy approach succeeds, highlighting the importance of collective behavior and the quantum-classical correspondence in gravitational wave physics. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the quantum nature of gravity and its observable effects in macroscopic physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the thermal radiation derived by Hawking can be smoothly extended to the $T=0$ limit for Kerr black holes. The emission of the modes with $\omega &gt; m\Omega $ comes to a halt as the surface gravity vanishes. However, Kerr black holes smoothly continue to radiate both in bosonic and fermionic modes with $\omega &lt; m\Omega$, at the $T=0$ limit. We derive explicit expressions for the absorption probabilities which imply that the highest rate of emission pertains to the modes with $\omega=(m\Omega)/2$, both for bosonic and fermionic cases. At the zero limit of thermal radiation, the number of emitted particles vanishes as $\omega \to 0$, which strictly differentiates it from the non-thermal radiation of soft particles by extremal Kerr black holes. We also note that the thermal radiation at the zero limit, drives the black hole away from extremality in accord with the third law and the cosmic censorship conjecture</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Calculation of LIGO-like Compton Scattering and Experiment Proposal for Graviton Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the lack of a universally accepted quantum gravity theory, gravitons are considered the quantum noise in gravitational waves. Wave mediation requires that gravitons be in a coherence state, with an abundance number of order $\sim10^{79}$. Thus, the detection of coherent-state gravitons may be possible in a LIGO-like experiment via Compton scattering with a nanospherical test mass. This work presents the associating scattering amplitude calculation using effective field theory, calculating a total cross section approximately $100 ~\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a coherence state and $\sim10^{-81}~\mathrm{m^2}$ for a single graviton. An experiment proposal involving levitation techniques of a nanosphere is given in full description.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes (sBBHs) can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signal, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently, we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5%, the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.49 $M_{\odot}$and a relative error precision of 0.13.</description>

      <title>To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence observationally viable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here, we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA for different boundary topologies, i.e. sphere and torus, using super-Virasoro TQFT. We use fusion and modular kernels of the super-Liouville theory to compute the necklace-channel conformal block and showcase formalism by proving that the inner product holds for superconformal blocks, defined as states in the Hilbert space. Finally, we compute the out-of-time-order correlator for the torus topology with superconformal primary insertions as matter using the tools of super-Virasoro TQFT and investigate its early-time behaviour.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning classifier for the postmerger remnant of binary neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowing the kind of remnant produced after the merger of a binary neutron star system, e.g., if a black hole forms or not, would not only shed light on the equation of state describing the extremely dense matter inside neutron stars, but also help understand the physical processes involved in the postmerger phase. Moreover, in the event of a gravitational-wave detection, predicting the presence of a neutron star remnant is crucial in order to advise potential electromagnetic follow-up campaigns. In this work, we use Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and publicly available data from numerical-relativity simulations to construct a classifier that predicts the outcome of binary neutron star mergers, based on the binary's parameters inferred from gravitational-wave inspiral signals: total mass, mass-weighted tidal deformability, mass ratio, and effective inspiral spin. Employing parameters that can be estimated from the inspiral part of the signal only allows us to predict the remnant independently on the detection of a postmerger gravitational-wave signal. We build three different classifiers to distinguish between various potential scenarios, we estimate their accuracy and the confidence of their predictions. Finally, we apply the developed classifiers to real events data, finding that GW170817 most likely led to the formation of a hypermassive neutron star, while GW190425 to a prompt collapse to a black hole.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>Stars or gas? Constraining the hardening processes of massive black-hole binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive black-hole binaries will be the loudest sources detectable by LISA. These systems are predicted to form during the hierarchical assembly of cosmic structures and coalesce by interacting with the surrounding environment. The hardening phase of their orbit is driven by either stars or gas and encodes distinctive features into the binary black holes that can potentially be reconstructed with gravitational-wave observations. We present a Bayesian framework to assess the likelihood of massive mergers being hardened by either gaseous or stellar interactions. We use state-of-the-art astrophysical models tracking the cosmological evolution of massive black-hole binaries and construct a large number of simulated catalogs of sources detectable by LISA. From these, we select a representative catalog and run both parameter estimation assuming a realistic LISA response as well model comparison capturing selection effects. Our results suggest that, at least within the context of the adopted models, future LISA observations can confidently constrain whether stars or gas are responsible for the binary hardening. We stress that accurate astrophysical modeling of the black-hole spins and the inclusion of subdominant emission modes in the adopted signal might be crucial to avoid systematic biases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The background spacetime interpolates between Anti-de Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The new black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. Thus, they are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is enclosed inside their inner horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other new black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the new charged black strings. The black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We find that their masses can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the Kalb-Ramond field in the black strings. We show that their angular momenta do not depend on their horizons radii. We also discuss black hole and black string solutions with a curvature singularity at or beyond their outer or event horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Euclidean methods we investigate the thermodynamics of stealth black hole solutions, which are solutions that geometrically are indistinguishable from those of general relativity, however they are accompanied by a non-trivial additional field that does not back-react to the metric. We find that in general, one can observe shifts in the mass and/or the entropy of such black holes, hence, at least at the thermodynamic level, the stealth solutions may be distinguished by the those of general relativity. We also point out an example, the {\it{bona fide stealth}}, where a non-trivial scalar field can accompany an (A)dS-Schwarzschild black hole without altering the thermodynamic quantities. We point out that thermodynamic discrepancies arise due to the additional boundary terms emanating from the stealth fields, where care should be given in order for the theory at hand to possess a well-defined variational procedure.</description>

Abstract: We probe four dimensional accelerating black holes with D-brane and build up the notion of metallic holography for spacetime with negative cosmological constant. We explore various thermodynamic entities associated with the boundary QFT at low temperatures and finite chemical potential. The DC conductivity in the boundary QFT is enhanced due to the effects of black hole acceleration in the bulk counterpart. We further compute resistivity in different temperature regime, which reveals a new quantum liquid phase with dynamic critical exponent $ z=3 $.</description>

      <title>Horizon Entropy Refined: Quantum Contributions and Cosmological Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of quantum fluctuations on the event horizon area and their implications for corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These quantum corrections are incorporated into the framework of large-scale gravitational systems, utilizing the holographic principle to derive modified Friedmann equations. By redefining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, our model predicts significant alterations to the Friedmann equations within specific parameter ranges, offering novel perspectives on cosmological scales. Using distance modulus data from the Pantheon supernova sample, we demonstrate the model's potential to constrain the parameters governing quantum corrections and address unresolved cosmological issues. Crucially, our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations can increase the area of the event horizon by up to 47\%. Beyond this threshold, theoretical predictions encounter substantial challenges when compared with observational data. This approach bridges quantum gravity and observational cosmology, opening new avenues for testing and refining theoretical models.</description>
