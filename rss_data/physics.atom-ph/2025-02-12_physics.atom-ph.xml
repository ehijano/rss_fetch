      <title>Imaging of induced surface charge distribution effects in glass vapor cells used for Rydberg atom-based sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the imaging of localized surface electric (E) field effects on the atomic spectrum in a vapor cell used in Rydberg atom-based sensors. These surface E-fields can result from an induced electric charge distribution on the surface. Induced surface charge distributions can dramatically perturb the atomic spectrum, hence degrading the ability to perform electrometry. These effects become pronounced near the walls of the vapor cell, posing challenges for vapor cell miniaturization. Using a fluorescence imaging technique, we investigate the effects of surface charge on the atomic spectrum generated with electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Our results reveal that visible light (480 nm and 511 nm), i.e., the coupling laser used in two-photon Rydberg EIT schemes, generates localized patches of charge or dipoles where this light interacts with the glass walls of the vapor cell, while a three-photon Rydberg EIT scheme using only near-infrared wavelength lasers shows no measurable field induction. Additionally, imaging in a vacuum chamber where a glass plate is placed between large electrodes confirms that the induced charge is positive. We further validate these findings by studying the photoelectric effect with broadband light during EIT and impedance measurements. These results demonstrate the power of the fluorescence imaging technique to study localized E-field distributions in vapor cells and to target the photoelectric effect of the alkali-exposed glass of vapor cells as a major disruptor in Rydberg atom-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution optical trapping of multiple cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of optical tweezers form the backbone of neutral atoms analog and digital quantum processors. However, the inter-trap distance remains generally much larger than the size of the tweezers to avoid interference-induced trap distortions, limiting the trap density. Here, we report single-atom trapping in four super-resolved tweezers, meaning with a separation below the Sparrow diffraction limit. The optical pattern is generated using superoscillatory phenomenon leading to subwavelength traps with full control of the trap relative phases. We investigate two sets of relative phases that impede or allow the hopping and the reshuffling of atoms. We envision that superoscillatory light structuring will bridge the gap between large-distance traps generated by tweezer arrays and short-distance traps formed with optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Robust high-temperature atomic beam source with a microcapillary array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new design for a directed high-flux high-temperature atomic vapor source for use in atomic physics experiments conducted under vacuum. An externally heated nozzle made of an array of stainless steel microcapillaries produces a collimated atomic beam. Welded stainless steel construction allows for operation at high source temperatures without exposing delicate conflat vacuum flanges to thermal stress, greatly enhancing robustness compared to previously published designs. We report in operando performance measurements of an atomic beam of lithium at various operating temperatures.</description>

      <title>Pashen-Back effect for plasma diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of determining the magnitude of neutral atom density in hydrogen plasma was investigated using Paschen-Back effect and resonant Faraday rotation of the polarization plane of light by residual neutral atoms in the plasma. In strong magnetic fields when the Zeeman shift is greater than the distance of the hyperfine structure energy levels the Paschen-Back effect is observed. In this case, it is no longer possible to speak about the independence of the splitting of each level of a given multiplet term.</description>

      <title>Vibrational parametric arrays with trapped ions: non-Hermitian topological phases and quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a linear array of trapped ions subjected to local parametric modulation of the trapping potential and continuous laser cooling. In our model, the phase of the parametric modulation varies linearly along the array, breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing non-trivial topological effects. The linear response to an external force is investigated with the Green's function formalism. We predict the appearance of topological amplification regimes in which the trapped ion array behaves as a directional amplifier of vibrational excitations. The emergence of topological phases is determined by a winding number related to non-Hermitian point-gap topology. Beyond its fundamental interests as a topological driven-dissipative system, our setup can be used for quantum sensing of ultra-weak forces and electric fields. We consider a scheme in which a trapped ion at one edge of the array acts as a sensor of an ultra-weak force, and the vibrational signal gets amplified towards the last trapped ion, which acts as a detector. We consider arrays of 2-30 $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ions, assuming that the detector ion's displacement is measured via fluorescence with a spatial resolution of 200-500 nm, and predict sensitivities as small as 1 yN $\cdot$ Hz$^{-1/2}$. Our system has the advantage that the detected force frequency can be tuned by adjusting the frequency of the periodic drive.</description>

      <title>Optical pattern formation in self-focusing and self-defocusing diffractively thick media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atomic clouds constitute highly resonant nonlinear optical media, whose refractive index can be easily tuned via the light frequency. When subjected to a retro-reflected laser beam and under appropriate conditions, the cloud undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking and spatial patterns develop in the transverse cross-section of the beam. We investigate the impact of the sign of the light detuning from the atomic resonance on these patterns, thus directly comparing pattern formation for self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities. Our observations emphasize the need for a ''diffractively thick'' medium description of the light-cloud interaction, where diffraction and nonlinear propagation inside the sample are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Relativistic hyperpolarizabilities for atomic H, Li, and Be$^+$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hyperpolarizability of an atom is a property that describes the nonlinear interaction between an atom and an external electric field leading to a higher-order Stark shift. Accurate evaluations of these coefficients for various systems are crucial to improve experimental precision in advanced atom-based clocks. However, there is a dearth of reports on atomic hyperpolarizabilities, particularly regarding relativistic hyperpolarizabilities. Thus, in this paper, we use fourth-order perturbation theory to establish a universal formula for the hyperpolarizability and calculate the relativistic hyperpolarizabilities of low-lying states for the monovalent electronic atomic systems H, Li, and Be$^+$. The highly accurate results given here for the H atom could serve as benchmarks for other theoretical methods.</description>

      <title>Ultracold Interactions between Ions and Polar Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a platform for observing and controlling the interactions between atomic ions and a quantum gas of polar molecules in the ultracold regime. This approach is based on the combination of several recently developed methods in two so-far complementary research domains: ion-atom collisions and studies of ultracold polar molecules. In contrast to collisions between ions and ground-state atoms, which are dominated by losses due to three-body recombination (TBR) already at densities far below those typical for quantum degenerate ensembles, our proposal makes use of polar molecules, their rich level structure, and sensitivity to electric fields to design effective interaction potentials where ion-neutral TBR losses and molecule-molecule losses due to sticky collisions could be strongly suppressed. This may open a broad range of applications including precise control of collisional properties in molecular ensembles using ions, quantum simulations, and cold quantum chemistry between polyatomic molecules.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a review and perspective on quantum gases in bubble traps. We emphasize how the idea of realizing shell shaped condensates emerged and was enabled by the invention of the radiofrequency adiabatic potential technique. We review the many subsequent theoretical works that address the new physics emerging for a condensate trapped on a closed surface. We present the current status of the experiments, the challenges ahead and highlight how a different approach using an immiscible mixture of two condensates enabled the first observation of a shell-shaped degenerate gas. Finally we list a few open questions that we believe provide interesting research directions.</description>

      <title>Wavelength modulation laser spectroscopy of N$_2$O at 17 $\mu$m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser and wavelength modulation absorption spectroscopy, we measure the frequencies of ro-vibrational transitions of N$_2$O in the 17 $\mu$m region with uncertainties below 5 MHz. These lines, corresponding to the bending mode of the molecule, can be used for calibration of spectrometers in this spectral region. We present a model for the lineshapes of absorption features in wavelength modulation spectroscopy that takes into account Doppler broadening, collisional broadening, saturation of the absorption, and lineshape distortion due to frequency and intensity modulation. Combining our data with previous measurements, we provide a set of spectroscopic parameters for several vibrational states of N$_2$O. The lines measured here fall in the same spectral region as a mid-infrared frequency reference that we are currently developing using trapped, ultracold molecules. With such a frequency reference, the spectroscopic methods demonstrated here have the potential to improve frequency calibration in this part of the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond science and frequency metrology rely on the precise measurement and control of the laser pulse waveform, a feat traditionally achieved using optoelectronic techniques. In this study, we conducted a laser-induced acoustic experiment in air ionized by carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-stabilized sub-4 femtosecond pulses. Our results reveal that the acoustic signal exhibits CEP dependence in few-cycle pulses, primarily through amplitude modulation from laser-driven ionization. This novel optoacoustic phenomenon enables not only the measurement of the carrier-envelope offset frequency but also the direct characterization of the waveform of optical pulses through a microphone. Our study highlights the potential of laser-induced acoustic waves for advancing frequency metrology and ultrafast science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol based on the interplay between superradiance and superabsorption to achieve the coherent deflection of an atomic sample due to the momentum transfer from the atoms to a cavity field. The coherent character of this momentum transfer, causing the atomic sample to deflect as a whole, follows from the collective nature of the atomic superradiant pulse and its superabsorption by the cavity field. The protocol is then used for the construction of positional mesoscopic atomic superpositions.</description>

      <title>Resonant Photon Scattering in the Presence of External Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This theoretical study explores resonant elastic photon scattering in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, motivated by potential applications in storage ring experiments, such as the Gamma Factory project at CERN. In this framework, resonant scattering involves head-on collisions of relativistic ion beams and counter-propagating laser photons, leading to a strong enhancement of the external field strength due to the Lorentz transformation between ion rest and laboratory frame. Calculations for He-like Ca ions reveal a notable impact of the external fields on the scattering rate as well as the angular distribution and polarization of emitted photons. This opens interesting avenues for diverse applications for the Gamma Factory project, such as as resonance condition tuning, beam cooling, and polarization control.</description>
