      <title>Emergent transfinite topological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a sequence $S=\{(X,f_n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of dynamical systems sharing a common ambient space, the point $f^k_n(x)$ visited by a certain $x\in X$ depends on the iteration order $k$ and on the index $n$ specifying the system in $S$. If the sequence of maps $\{f_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is eventually constant at every point, the $f_n$-orbits show an emergent poset structure. A maximal initial segment of this poset is isomorphic to a certain countable ordinal $\ge\omega$. We study this transfinite emergent structure from the point of view of topological dynamics, investigating orbits, recurrence, limit sets, attractors and conjugacy.</description>

      <title>Topologically mixing suspension flows over shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for suspension flows over certain families of shift spaces to be topologically mixing. We also show the similarities and differences between this case and the smooth measure theoretic setting on a manifold. Additionally, we show that the set of roof functions defined on a shift space that produce suspension flows that are not topologically mixing is dense in the set of all continuous roof functions.</description>

      <title>Periodic solutions for McKean-Vlasov SDEs under periodic distribution-dependent Lyapunov conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of periodic solutions for McKean-Vlasov SDEs under periodic distribution-dependent Lyapunov conditions, which is obtained by periodic Markov processes with state space $\mathbb R^d\times \mathcal P(\mathbb R^d)$. Here $\mathcal P(\mathbb R^d)$ denotes the space of probability measures on $\mathbb R^d$. In addition, we show the convergence to the periodic solution and the continuous dependence on parameters of periodic solutions for McKean-Vlasov SDEs. Finally, we provide several examples to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Independence and mean sensitivity in minimal systems under group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X, G)$ be a topological dynamical system, where $G$ is an infinite countable discrete group. Suppose $(X, G)$ is minimal, has no essential $K$-IT-tuple, and one of the followings holds:
  (1) $(X,G)$ is incontractible;
  (2) $(X,G)$ is local Bronstein, and admits an invariant Borel probability measure.
  Then, $(X,G)$ is a regular $K'$ to one extension of its maximal equicontinuous factor for some $1\le K'\le K-1$. Especially, we give an affirmative answer to a conjecture proposed by Huang, Lian, Shao and Ye (J. Funct. Anal., 2021).
  If $(X, G)$ is minimal where $G$ is amenable, under the local Bronstein condition, we establish parallel results regarding weak mean sensitivity and find that every weakly mean-sensitivity tuple is an IT-tuple.</description>

      <title>Long- and short-time behavior of hypocoercive evolution equations via modal decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long- and short-time behavior of solutions to dissipative evolution equations is studied by applying the concept of hypocoercivity. Aiming at partial differential equations that allow for a modal decomposition, we compute estimates that are uniform with respect to all modes. While the special example of the kinetic Lorentz equation was treated in previous work of the authors, that analysis is generalized here to general evolution equations having a scaled family of generators.</description>

      <title>Calculation of explicit expressions for the Hopf bifurcation limit cycles in delay-differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology to derive explicit power series approximations for the limit cycle periodic solutions of the Hopf bifurcation in autonomous discrete delay differential equations (DDE). The procedure extends the methodology introduced by Casal and Freedman in 1980 by providing a detailed algorithm that iteratively performs systematic calculations up to any desired order of approximation, ensuring a specific error tolerance for any nonlinear DDE presenting a Hopf bifurcation. The methodology is applied to two relevant delay-differential models to illustrate its features: a recently introduced car-following mobility model, whose oscillations are a plausible explanation for the density waves and congestion in road traffic, and a SIR epidemic model for propagation of diseases with temporary immunity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study recurrence and ergodicity of cocycles with values in R d , d $\ge$ 1, over rotations by badly approximable irrational numbers on T $\rho$ , $\rho$ \&amp;gt; 1. The discontinuities of the functions generating the cocycles also satisfy a Diophantine condition. For simplicity of notation we mainly consider the cases $\rho$ = 2, d = 1 and 2.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Conditions for Domination of $\mathrm{M}(2,\mathbb{C})$-sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-sequence is uniformly hyperbolic if and only it satisfies a uniform exponential growth condition. Similarly, for $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-sequences whose determinants are uniformly bounded away from zero, it has dominated splitting if and only if it satisfies a uniform exponential gap condition between the two singular values. Inspired by [QTZ], we provide a similar equivalent description in terms of singular values for $\mathrm{M}(2,\mathbb{C})$-sequences that admit dominated splitting. We also prove a version of the Avalanche Principle for such sequences.</description>

      <title>Spillover-Free Control of the Semilinear Heat Equation via the $L^2$ Residue Separation and Harmonic Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for designing spillover-free finite-dimensional output-feedback controllers for systems governed by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Building on the recently developed $L^2$ residue separation for state-feedback control, we extend this concept to output-feedback using a novel harmonic inequality, which provides an optimal bound on the residue in terms of the weighted $l^2$ norm of its Fourier coefficients. We apply this approach to a 1D semilinear heat equation, where the measured output and unknown nonlinearity link the dominant and residual modes, leading to spillover if the residual modes are neglected in the controller design. We demonstrate how to compute the input-to-residue $L^2$ gain and utilize it to design a spillover-free controller. Additionally, we show how the refined approach eliminates the need for the lifting transformation, enabling a sample-and-hold implementation of the control signal.</description>

      <title>Improved estimates of statistical properties in some non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon previous works by Young, Chernov-Zhang and Bruin-Melbourne-Terhesiu, we present a general scheme to improve bounds on the statistical properties (in particular, decay of correlations, and rates in the almost sure invariant principle) for a class of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. Specifically, for systems with polynomial, yet summable mixing rates, our method removes logarithmic factors of earlier arguments, resulting in essentially optimal bounds. Applications include Wojtkowski's system of two falling balls, dispersing billiards with flat points and Bunimovich's flower-shaped billiard tables.</description>

      <title>Multi-front dynamics in spatially inhomogeneous Allen-Cahn equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of biological, chemical, and physical pattern-forming systems have started to go beyond the classic `near onset' and `far from equilibrium' theories for homogeneous systems to include the effects of spatial heterogeneities. In this article, we build a conceptual understanding of the impact of spatial heterogeneities on the pattern dynamics of reaction-diffusion models. We consider the simplest setting of an explicit, scalar, bi-stable Allen-Cahn equation driven by a general small-amplitude spatially-heterogeneous term $\varepsilon F(U,U_x,x)$. In the first part, we perform an analysis of the existence and stability of stationary one-, two- and $N$-front patterns for general spatial heterogeneity $F(U,U_x,x)$. In addition, we explicitly determine the $N$-th order system of ODEs that governs the evolution of the front positions of general $N$-front patterns to leading order. In the second part, we focus on a particular class of spatial heterogeneities where $F(U,U_x,x) = H'(x) U_x + H''(x) U$ with $H$ either spatially periodic or localised. For spatially periodic heterogeneities, we show that the fronts of a multi-front pattern will get `pinned' if the distances between successive fronts are sufficiently large, {\it i.e.}, the multi-front pattern is attracted to a nearby stable stationary multi-front pattern. For localised heterogeneities, we determine all stationary $N$-front patterns, and show that these are unstable for $N &gt; 1$. We find instead slowly evolving `trains' of $N$-fronts that collectively travel to $\pm \infty$, either with slowly decreasing or increasing speeds.</description>

      <title>Rotation number and dynamics of 3-interval piecewise $\lambda$-affine contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a parametric family of orientation-preserving piecewise contractions defined for every $x\in[0,1)$ by $f(x)=\lambda x + \delta + d \theta_a(x) \pmod 1$, where $\lambda\in(0,1)$, $d\in(0,1-\lambda)$, $\delta\in[0,1]$, $a\in[0,1]$ and $\theta_a(x)=1$ if $x\geq a$ and $\theta_a(x)=0$ otherwise. In the special case where $a=1$, the family reduces to the well studied "contracted rotations" $x\mapsto \lambda x + \delta \pmod 1$, which are 2-interval piecewise contractions when $\delta\in(1-\lambda,1)$. In the present paper, we allow any $a\in[0,1]$ in order to also consider maps with an additional discontinuity, that is, $3$-interval piecewise contractions. Supposing $\lambda$ and $d$ fixed, for any $\rho\in(0,1)$, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the values of the parameters $\delta$ and $a$ for $\rho$ to be the rotation number of the corresponding map. Under these conditions, we relate the map $f$ to a rotation $R_\rho$ of angle $\rho$, by giving the expression of a function $\phi:[0,1)\to\Lambda$ such that $f \circ \phi = \phi \circ R_\rho$, where $\Lambda$ is the support of the asymptotic dynamics of $f$. This enables us to study the dynamics as a function of $\delta$ and $a$ and to construct concrete examples of 3-interval piecewise contractions with some prescribed rotation number, attractor and symbolic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large scale chaotic, topological structure of the trajectories of an infinite sequence of dispersing, hence ergodic, $2D$ billiards with the configuration space $Q_n=\mathbb{T}^2 \setminus \bigcup_{i=0}^{n-1} D_i$, where the scatterers $D_i$ ($i=0,1,\dots,n-1$) are disks of radius $r&lt;&lt;1$ centered at the points $(i/n, 0)$ mod $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We get effective lower and upper radial bounds for the rotation set $R$. Furthermore, we also prove the compactness of the admissible rotation set $AR$ and the fact that the rotation vectors $v$ corresponding to admissible periodic orbits form a dense subset of $AR$. We also obtain asymptotic lower and upper estimates for the sequence $h_{top}(n)$ of topological entropies and precise asymptotic formulas for the metric entropies $h_{\mu}(n,r)$.</description>

      <title>Discovering Dynamics with Kolmogorov Arnold Networks: Linear Multistep Method-Based Algorithms and Error Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncovering the underlying dynamics from observed data is a critical task in various scientific fields. Recent advances have shown that combining deep learning techniques with linear multistep methods (LMMs) can be highly effective for this purpose. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) with LMMs for the discovery and approximation of dynamical systems' vector fields. Specifically, we begin by establishing precise error bounds for two-layer B-spline KANs when approximating the governing functions of dynamical systems. Leveraging the approximation capabilities of KANs, we demonstrate that for certain families of LMMs, the total error is constrained within a specific range that accounts for both the method's step size and the network's approximation accuracy. Additionally, we analyze the difference between the numerical solution obtained from solving the ordinary differential equations with the fitted vector fields and the true solution of the dynamical system. To validate our theoretical results, we provide several numerical examples that highlight the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>On functoriality of Baum-Bott residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension $n$, then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $ \geq \min\{ k - 1,n-k-1\}$. In particular, if $k\leq n/2$, then $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville--Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $ X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the singularities of potential energy functionals \(\phi(\cdot)\) associated with semiconcave functions \(\phi\) in the Borel probability measure space and their propagation properties. Our study covers two cases: when \(\phi\) is a semiconcave function and when \(u\) is a weak KAM solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation \(H(x, Du(x)) = c[0]\) on a smooth closed manifold. By applying previous work on Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the Wasserstein space, we prove that the singularities of \(u(\cdot)\) will propagate globally when \(u\) is a weak KAM solution, and the dynamical cost function \(C^t\) is the associated fundamental solution. We also demonstrate the existence of solutions evolving along the cut locus, governed by an irregular Lagrangian semiflow on the cut locus of \(u\).</description>

      <title>Instability bands for periodic traveling waves in the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two families of periodic traveling waves exist in the focusing mKdV (modified Korteweg-de Vries) equation. Spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to co-periodic perturbations of the same period has been previously explored by using spectral analysis and variational formulation. By using tools of integrability such as a relation between squared eigenfunctions of the Lax pair and eigenfunctions of the linearized stability problem, we revisit the spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to perturbations of arbitrary periods. In agreement with previous works, we find that one family is spectrally stable for all parameter configurations, whereas the other family is spectrally unstable for all parameter configurations. We show that the onset of the co-periodic instability for the latter family changes the instability bands from figure-$8$ (crossing at the imaginary axis) into figure-$\infty$ (crossing at the real axis).</description>

      <title>Traveling periodic waves and breathers in the nonlocal derivative NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlocal derivative NLS (nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger) equation describes modulations of waves in a stratified fluid and a continuous limit of the Calogero--Moser--Sutherland system of particles. For the defocusing version of this equation, we prove the linear stability of the nonzero constant background for decaying and periodic perturbations and the nonlinear stability for periodic perturbations. For the focusing version of this equation, we prove linear and nonlinear stability of the nonzero constant background under some restrictions. For both versions, we characterize the traveling periodic wave solutions by using Hirota's bilinear method, both on the nonzero and zero backgrounds. For each family of traveling periodic waves, we construct families of breathers which describe solitary waves moving across the stable background. A general breather solution with $N$ solitary waves propagating on the traveling periodic wave background is derived in a closed determinant form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we provide equivalent definitions for fractal geometric dimensions through dyadic cube constructions. Given a metric space $X$ with finite Assouad dimension, i.e., satisfying the doubling property, we show that the construction of systems of dyadic cubes by Hyt\"onen-Kairema is compatible with many dimensions. In particular, the Hausdorff, Minkowski, and Assouad dimensions can be equivalently expressed solely using dyadic cubes in the aforementioned system. The same is true for the Assouad spectrum, a collection of dimensions introduced by Fraser-Yu.</description>

      <title>Modeling and stability analysis of live systems with time-varying dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of the classical control theory is the assumption that the state space and its dimension do not change with time. This prevents analyzing and even formalizing the stability and control problems for open multi-agent systems whose agents may enter or leave the network, industrial processes where the sensors or actuators may be exchanged frequently, smart grids, etc. In this work, we propose a framework of live systems that covers a rather general class of systems with a time-varying state space. We argue that input-to-state stability is a proper stability notion for this class of systems, and many of the classic tools and results, such as Lyapunov methods and superposition theorems, can be extended to this setting.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems for remote validation of very high-resolution ocean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents and investigates a novel methodology for validating high-resolution ocean models using satellite imagery. High-resolution ocean models provide detailed information in coastal areas where other available data products are too coarse. Models are usually fitted by comparing them with observations; However, accessing in situ data in all small coastal areas is not feasible, as in situ observations are scarce and obtained through dedicated ships or instruments in limited and selected regions. Our work aims to use alternative remote sensing information to overcome this challenge. The approach involves establishing connections between the satellite observations and the outcomes of various computational experiments carried out using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), which allows the selection of different parameters to run the ocean model. These choices are not fully determined a priori and each one produces distinct outputs, which are then linked to the images through dynamical systems objects. By defining a performance index, we are able to quantify which experiment provides a better representation of the local ocean state.</description>

Abstract: \textit{Non-statistical dynamics} are those for which a set of points with positive measure (w.r.t. a reference probability measure which is in most examples the Lebesgue on a manifold) do not have a convergent sequence of empirical measures. In this paper, we show that behind the existence of non-statistical dynamics, there is some other dynamical property: \textit{statistical instability}. To this aim, we present a general formalization of the notions of statistical stability and instability and introduce sufficient conditions on a subset of dynamical systems to contain non-statistical maps in terms of statistical instability. We follow this idea and introduce a new class of non-statistical maps in the space of Anasov-Katok diffeomorphisms of the annulus.</description>

Abstract: We prove the arithemtic quantum unique ergodicity (AQUE) conjecture for sequences of Hecke--Maass forms on quotients $\Gamma\backslash (\mathbb{H}^{(2)})^r \times (\mathbb{H}^{(3)})^s$. An argument by induction on dimension of the orbit allows us to rule out the limit measure concentrating on closed orbits of proper subgroups despite many returns of the Hecke correspondence to neighborhoods of the orbit.</description>

      <title>Ergodic dichotomy for subspace flows in higher rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ergodicity of a one-parameter diagonalizable subgroup of a connected semisimple real algebraic group $G$ acting on a homogeneous space or, more generally, a homogeneous-like space, equipped with a Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan type measure. These flow spaces are associated with Anosov subgroups of $G$, or more generally, with transverse subgroups of $G$.
  We obtain an ergodicity criterion similar to the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy for the ergodicity of the geodesic flow on hyperbolic manifolds. In addition, we extend this criterion to the action of any connected diagonal subgroup of arbitrary dimension. Our criterion provides a codimension dichotomy on the ergodicity of a connected diagonalizable subgroup for general Anosov subgroups. This generalizes an earlier work by Burger-Landesberg-Lee-Oh for Borel Anosov subgroups.</description>

      <title>Continuation of Periodic Orbits in Conservative Hybrid Dynamical Systems and its Application to Mechanical Systems with Impulsive Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous differential equations where a single first integral is present, periodic orbits are well-known to belong to one-parameter families, parameterized by the first integral's values. This paper shows that this characteristic extends to a broader class of conservative hybrid dynamical systems (cHDSs). We study periodic orbits of a cHDS, introducing the concept of a hybrid first integral to characterize conservation in these systems. Additionally, our work presents a methodology that utilizes numerical continuation methods to generate these periodic orbits, building upon the concept of normal periodic orbits introduced by Sepulchre and MacKay (1997). We specifically compare state-based and time-based implementations of an cHDS as an important application detail in generating periodic orbits. Furthermore, we showcase the continuation process using exemplary conservative mechanical systems with impulsive dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic procedure for testing whether reaction networks exhibit non-expansivity or monotonicity. This procedure identifies explicit norms under which a network is non-expansive or cones for which the system is monotone-or provides proof that no such structures exist. Our approach reproduces known results, generates novel findings, and demonstrates that certain reaction networks cannot exhibit monotonicity or non-expansivity with respect to any cone or norm. Additionally, we establish a duality relationship which states that if a network is monotone, so is its dual network.</description>

Abstract: We study the smoothness properties of a global and nonautonomous topological conjugacy between a linear system and a quasilinear perturbation. The linear system exhibits a nonuniform exponential dichotomy with a nontrivial projector and nonuniform bounded growth property. Additionally, the quasilinear perturbation is dominated by an increasing exponential function. Emphasis is placed on employing a set of parameters to describe the conditions of dichotomy, bounded growth and quasilinear perturbations. Finally, we prove that modifying these conditions enables us to achieve a broader smoothness interval.</description>

Abstract: Conditional symmetries were introduced by Levi and Winternitz in their 1989 seminal paper to deal with nonlinear PDEs. Here we discuss their application in the framework of ODEs, and more specifically Dynamical Systems; it turns out they are closely related to two established -- albeit maybe less widely known -- concepts, i.e. orbital symmetries and configurational invariants. The paper is devoted to studying the interplay of these notions, and their application in the study of Dynamical Systems, with special attention to invariant manifolds of these.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the relationship between the shadowing property of set-valued maps and their associated inverse limit systems. We show that if a set-valued map is expansive and open in the context of set-valued dynamics, then certain induced inverse limit systems have the shadowing property. Additionally, we prove that a continuous set-valued map has the shadowing property if and only if some of its induced inverse limit system also has shadowing property. Finally, we establish that the shadowing property of a set-valued map is equivalent to the shadowing property of its induced inverse set-valued system.</description>

Abstract: The first step in investigating fractional difference maps, which do not have periodic points except fixed points, is to find asymptotically periodic points and bifurcation points and draw asymptotic bifurcation diagrams. Recently derived equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points contain coefficients defined as slowly converging infinite sums. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for coefficients of the equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference maps.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a mathematical model of city formation by migration of firms and workers. The Core-Periphery model in the new economic geography, which considers migration of workers driven by real wage inequality among regions, is extended to incorporate migration of firms driven by real profit inequality among regions. Spatially homogeneous distributions of firms and workers become destabilized and eventually forms several cities in which both the firms and workers agglomerate, and the number of the cities decreases as transport costs become lower.</description>

      <title>How more data can hurt: Instability and regularization in next-generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been found recently that more data can, counter-intuitively, hurt the performance of deep neural networks. Here, we show that a more extreme version of the phenomenon occurs in data-driven models of dynamical systems. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focus on next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) -- a popular framework for learning dynamics from data. We find that, despite learning a better representation of the flow map with more training data, NGRC can adopt an ill-conditioned ``integrator'' and lose stability. We link this data-induced instability to the auxiliary dimensions created by the delayed states in NGRC. Based on these findings, we propose simple strategies to mitigate the instability, either by increasing regularization strength in tandem with data size, or by carefully introducing noise during training. Our results highlight the importance of proper regularization in data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>State-space models are accurate and efficient neural operators for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical methods for predicting dynamical systems, offering faster and more generalizable solutions. However, existing models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, and neural operators, face challenges such as long-time integration, long-range dependencies, chaotic dynamics, and extrapolation, to name a few. To this end, this paper introduces state-space models implemented in Mamba for accurate and efficient dynamical system operator learning. Mamba addresses the limitations of existing architectures by dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and enhancing computational efficiency through reparameterization techniques. To extensively test Mamba and compare against another 11 baselines, we introduce several strict extrapolation testbeds that go beyond the standard interpolation benchmarks. We demonstrate Mamba's superior performance in both interpolation and challenging extrapolation tasks. Mamba consistently ranks among the top models while maintaining the lowest computational cost and exceptional extrapolation capabilities. Moreover, we demonstrate the good performance of Mamba for a real-world application in quantitative systems pharmacology for assessing the efficacy of drugs in tumor growth under limited data scenarios. Taken together, our findings highlight Mamba's potential as a powerful tool for advancing scientific machine learning in dynamical systems modeling.

      <title>Sensitivity of ODE Solutions and Quantities of Interest with Respect to Component Functions in the Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the sensitivities of the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs. This extends existing ODE sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the ODE solution with respect to state-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carath\'eodory-type assumptions on the ODEs, the Implicit Function Theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fr\'echet differentiability of the ODE solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the ODE solution or QoI when the component function is perturbed. In applications, this new sensitivity-based bound on the ODE solution or QoI error is often much tighter than classical Gronwall-type error bounds. The sensitivity-based error bounds are applied to Zermelo's problem and to a trajectory simulation for a hypersonic vehicle.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically full measure sets of almost-periodic solutions for the NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of solutions for a family of nonlinear Schroedinger equations on the circle, with a smooth convolution potential and Gevrey regular initial data. Our main result is the construction of an asymptotically full measure set of small-amplitude time almost-periodic solutions, which are dense on invariant tori. In regions corresponding to positive actions, we prove that such maximal invariant tori are Banach manifolds, which provide a Cantor foliation of the phase space. As a consequence, we establish that, for many small initial data, the Gevrey norm of the solution remains approximately constant for all time and hence the elliptic fixed point at the origin is Lyapunov statistically stable. This is first result in KAM Theory for PDEs that regards the persistence of a large measure set of invariant tori and hence may be viewed as a strict extension to the infinite dimensional setting of the classical KAM theorem.</description>

      <title>A formula of local Maslov index and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly express the local Maslov index by a Maslov index in finite dimensional case without symplectic reduction. Then we calculate the Maslov index for the path of pairs of Lagrangian subspaces in triangular form. In particular, we get the Maslov-type index of a given symplectic path in triangle form. As applications, we calculate the splitting numbers of the symplectic matrix in triangle form, dependence of iteration theory on triangular frames and mod 2 Maslov-type index for a real symplectic path. We study the continuity of families of bounded linear relations and families of bounded linear operators acting on closed linear subspaces as technique preparations.</description>
