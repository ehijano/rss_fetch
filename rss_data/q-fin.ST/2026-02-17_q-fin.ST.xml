      <title>Predicting the success of new crypto-tokens: the Pump.fun case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of token launched on Pump.fun, a Solana-based launchpad platform, to identify the determinants of the token success. Pump.fun employs a bonding curve mechanism to bootstrap initial liquidity possibly leading to graduation to the on-chain market, which can be seen as a token success. We build predictive models of the probability of graduation conditional on the current amount of Solana locked in the bonding curve and a set of explanatory variables that capture structural and behavioral aspects of the launch process. Conditioning the graduation probability on these variables significantly improves its predictive power, providing insights into early-stage market behavior, speculative and manipulative dynamics, and the informational efficiency of bonding-curve-based token launches.</description>

      <title>Large and Deep Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a deep neural network (DNN) trained to construct a stochastic discount factor (SDF) admits a sharp additive decomposition that separates nonlinear characteristic discovery from the pricing rule that aggregates them. The economically relevant component of this decomposition is governed by a new object, the Portfolio Tangent Kernel (PTK), which captures the features learned by the network and induces an explicit linear factor pricing representation for the SDF. In population, the PTK-implied SDF converges to a ridge-regularized version of the true SDF, with the effective strength of regularization determined by the spectral complexity of the PTK. Using U.S. equity data, we show that the PTK representation delivers large and statistically significant performance gains, while its spectral complexity has risen sharply-by roughly a factor of six since the early 2000s-imposing increasingly tight limits on finite-sample pricing performance.</description>

      <title>Broken Symmetry of Stock Returns -- a Modified Jones-Faddy Skew t-Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that negative skew and positive mean of the distribution of stock returns are largely due to the broken symmetry of stochastic volatility governing gains and losses. Starting with stochastic differential equations for stock returns and for stochastic volatility we argue that the distribution of stock returns can be effectively split in two -- for gains and losses -- assuming difference in parameters of their respective stochastic volatilities. A modified Jones-Faddy skew t-distribution utilized here allows to reflect this in a single organic distribution which tends to meaningfully capture this asymmetry. We illustrate its application on distribution of daily S&amp;P500 returns, including analysis of its tails.</description>

      <title>The Extremity Premium: Sentiment Regimes and Adverse Selection in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index and Bitcoin daily data, we document that sentiment extremity predicts excess uncertainty beyond realized volatility. Extreme fear and extreme greed regimes exhibit significantly higher spreads than neutral periods -- a phenomenon we term the "extremity premium." Extended validation on the full Fear &amp; Greed history (February 2018--January 2026, N = 2,896) confirms the finding: within-volatility-quintile comparisons show a significant premium (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.21), Granger causality from uncertainty to spreads is strong (F = 211), and placebo tests reject the null (p &lt; 0.0001). The effect replicates on Ethereum and across 6 of 7 market cycles. However, the premium is sensitive to functional form: comprehensive regression controls absorb regime effects, while nonparametric stratification preserves them. We interpret this as evidence that sentiment extremity captures volatility-regime interactions not fully represented by parametric controls -- consistent with, but not conclusively separable from, the F&amp;G Index's embedded volatility component. An agent-based model reproduces the pattern qualitatively. The results suggest that intensity, not direction, drives uncertainty-linked liquidity withdrawal in cryptocurrency markets, though identification of "pure" sentiment effects from volatility remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>Same Returns, Different Risks: How Cryptocurrency Markets Process Infrastructure vs Regulatory Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether cryptocurrency markets differentiate between infrastructure failures and regulatory enforcement at the return level, complementing a companion conditional variance analysis that finds 5.7 times larger volatility impacts from infrastructure events (p = 0.0008). Using event-level block bootstrap inference on 31 events across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano (2019-2025), we find no statistically significant difference in cumulative abnormal returns between infrastructure failures (-7.6%) and regulatory enforcement (-11.1%): the difference of +3.6 pp has p = 0.81 with 95% CI [-25.3%, +30.9%]. This null acquires substantive meaning alongside the companion's highly significant variance result: the same events that produce indistinguishable return responses generate dramatically different volatility signatures. Markets differentiate shock types through the risk channel -- the second moment -- rather than expected returns. The block bootstrap methodology, which resamples entire events to preserve cross-sectional correlation, reveals that prior parametric approaches systematically understate uncertainty by inflating degrees of freedom. Results are robust across eight specifications including permutation tests, leave-one-out analysis, and the Ibragimov-Mueller few-cluster test.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Link between Out-of-Sample $R^2$ and Directional Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides a novel perspective on the metric disconnect phenomenon in financial time series forecasting through an analytical link that reconciles the out-of-sample $R^2$ ($R^2_{\text{OOS}}$) and directional accuracy (DA). In particular, using the random walk model as a baseline and assuming that sign correctness is independent of the realized magnitude, we show that these two metrics exhibit a quadratic relationship for MSE-optimal point forecasts. For point forecasts with modest DAs, the theoretical value of $R^2_{\text{OOS}}$ is intrinsically negligible. Thus, a negative empirical $R^2_{\text{OOS}}$ is expected if the model is suboptimal or affected by finite sample noise.</description>
