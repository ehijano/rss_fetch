      <title>On interwined polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be polynomials of degree at least two over $\mathbb C$. We say that $A_1$ and $A_2$ are intertwined if the endomorphism $(A_1, A_2)$ of $\mathbb C\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb C\mathbb P^1$ given by $(z_1, z_2) \mapsto (A_1(z_1), A_2(z_2))$ admits an irreducible periodic curve that is neither a vertical nor a horizontal line. We denote by $\mathrm{Inter}(A)$ the set of all polynomials $B$ such that some iterate of $B$ is intertwined with some iterate of $A$. In this paper, we prove a conjecture of Favre and Gauthier describing the structure of $\mathrm{Inter}(A)$. We also obtain a bound on the possible periods of periodic curves for endomorphisms $(A_1, A_2)$ in terms of the sizes of the symmetry groups of the Julia sets of $A_1$ and $A_2$.</description>

      <title>Early warning of critical transitions: distinguishing tipping points from Turing destabilizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current early warning signs for tipping points often fail to distinguish between catastrophic shifts and less dramatic state changes, such as spatial pattern formation. This paper introduces a novel method that addresses this limitation by providing more information about the type of bifurcation being approached starting from a spatially homogeneous system state. This method relies on estimates of the dispersion relation from noisy spatio-temporal data, which reveals whether the system is approaching a spatially homogeneous (tipping) or spatially heterogeneous (Turing patterning) bifurcation. Using a modified Klausmeier model, we validate this method on synthetic data, exploring its performance under varying conditions including noise properties and distance to bifurcation. We also determine the data requirements for optimal performance. Our results indicate the promise of a new spatial early warning system built on this method to improve predictions of future transitions in many climate subsystems and ecosystems, which is critical for effective conservation and management in a rapidly changing world.</description>

      <title>A Single-Equation Approach to Classifying Neuronal Operational Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neural coding is yet to be discovered. The neuronal operational modes that arise with fixed inputs but with varying degrees of stimulation help to elucidate their coding properties. In neurons receiving in vivo stimulation, we show that two operation modes can be described with simplified models: the coincidence detection mode and the integration mode. Our derivations include a simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients betam that captures the subthreshold dynamics of these modes of operation. The resulting model can explain these transitions with the sign and size of the smallest nonlinear coefficient of the polynomial alone. Defining neuronal operational modes provides insight into the processing and transmission of information through electrical currents. Requisite operational modes for proper neuronal functioning may explain disorders involving dysfunction of electrophysiological behavior, such as channelopathies.</description>

      <title>Localized Pattern Formation and Oscillatory Instabilities in a Three-component Gierer Meinhardt Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a three-component Gierer-Meinhardt model in the semi-strong interaction regime, characterized by an asymptotically large diffusivity ratio. A key feature of this model is that the interior spike can undergo Hopf bifurcations in both amplitude and position, leading to rich oscillatory dynamics not present in classical two-component systems. Using asymptotic analysis and numerical path-following, we construct localized spike equilibria and analyze spike nucleation that occurs through slow passage beyond a saddle-node bifurcation. Moreover, stability of spike equilibrium is analyzed by introducing time-scaling parameters, which reveal two distinct mechanisms: amplitude oscillations triggered by large-eigenvalue instabilities and oscillatory spike motion associated with small eigenvalues. Numerical simulations illustrate these dynamics and their transition regimes. This dual mechanism highlights richer spike behavior in three-component systems and suggests several open problems for future study.</description>

      <title>Inversion of an analytic operator function through Fredholm quotients and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the inverse of an analytic Fredholm operator-valued function A(z) near an isolated singularity within a general Banach space framework. Our approach relies on the sequential factorization of A(z) via Fredholm quotient operators. By analyzing the properties of these quotient operators near an isolated singularity, we fully characterize the Laurent series expansion of the inverse of A(z) in terms of its Taylor coefficients around the singularity. These theoretical results are subsequently applied to characterize the solution of a general autoregressive law of motion in a Banach space.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Guidance for Aerial Defense in Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical aerial defense challenge in contested airspace, involving three autonomous aerial vehicles -- a hostile drone (the pursuer), a high-value drone (the evader), and a protective drone (the defender). We present a cooperative guidance framework for the evader-defender team that guarantees interception of the pursuer before it can capture the evader, even under highly dynamic and uncertain engagement conditions. Unlike traditional heuristic, optimal control, or differential game-based methods, we approach the problem within a time-constrained guidance framework, leveraging true proportional navigation based approach that ensures robust and guaranteed solutions to the aerial defense problem. The proposed strategy is computationally lightweight, scalable to a large number of agent configurations, and does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy or control laws. From arbitrary initial geometries, our method guarantees that key engagement errors are driven to zero within a fixed time, leading to a successful mission. Extensive simulations across diverse and adversarial scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its relevance for real-time autonomous defense in contested airspace environments.</description>

      <title>Geometric conditions for matrix domination in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.00347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove a necessary and a sufficient condition for a finite subset of the special linear group to be dominated. These conditions are purely geometric in nature, as they only involve the trace and the eigenvectors of the matrices, and can be computed explicitly. Our sufficient condition, in particular, provides a simple algorithm for constructing a dominated set with prescribed eigenvectors. The techniques involved in our proofs take advantage of the interaction between dominated sets and two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.</description>

Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution result for a class of higher step nilflows, called filiform nilflows, and derive bounds on Weyl sums for higher degree polynomials with a power saving comparable to the best known, derived by J. Bourgain, C. Demeter and L. Guth and by T. Wooley from their proof of Vinogradov Main Conjecture. Our argument is based on ideas from dynamical systems (cohomological equations, invariant distributions) and on non-Abelian harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dynamics of Hepatitis B Virus Infection: Analysis, Stability, and Numerical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study develops and analyzes a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model for the dynamics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. While deterministic frameworks have yielded important insights into viral behavior, they cannot adequately describe the intrinsic randomness and fluctuations present in biological processes. To address this limitation, we construct a stochastic model incorporating multiplicative environmental noise to account for variability in infection rates, cellular mortality, and viral replication. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation by proving the existence, uniqueness, and global positivity of solutions for all biologically relevant initial conditions. Stability properties are investigated in detail, including stability in probability and almost sure exponential stability, with particular emphasis on conditions under which random perturbations stabilize the infection-free state. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution and derive convergence properties of the uninfected hepatocyte population. Numerical simulations, performed via the Euler-Maruyama method with sufficiently small time steps to ensure positivity and accuracy, validate the analytical results and illustrate the impact of stochastic fluctuations on system dynamics. The simulations confirm that environmental noise can induce viral extinction even in parameter regimes where deterministic analysis predicts persistence. These findings enhance the mathematical understanding of HBV infection dynamics and underscore the significant role of stochastic effects in shaping long-term disease outcomes.</description>

      <title>Stabilizability and lower spectral radius for linear switched systems with singular matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stabilizability of linear discrete-time switched systems with singular matrices, focusing on the spectral radius in this context. A new lower bound of the stabilizability radius is proposed, which is applicable to any matrix set. Based on this lower bound, more relationships between the stabilizability radius and joint spectral subradius are established. Detailed analysis of the stabilizability radius of a special kind of two-dimensional switched system, consisting of a singular matrix and a rotation matrix, is presented. The Hausdorff dimensions of the parameter sets such that the stabilizability radius of these systems equals a constant are also presented. Other properties of switched systems with singular matrices are also discussed along with examples.</description>

      <title>Competing bootstrap processes on the random graph $G(n,p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00363v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend classical bootstrap percolation by introducing two concurrent, competing processes on an Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p_n)$. Each node can assume one of three states: red, black, or white. The process begins with $a_R^{(n)}$ randomly selected active red seeds and $a_B^{(n)}$ randomly selected active black seeds, while all other nodes start as white and inactive. White nodes activate according to independent Poisson clocks with rate 1. Upon activation, a white node evaluates its neighborhood: if its red (black) active neighbors exceed its black (red) active neighbors by at least a fixed threshold $r \geq 2$, the node permanently becomes red (black) and active. Model's key parameters are $r$ (fixed), $n$ (tending to $\infty$), $a_R^{(n)}$, $a_B^{(n)}$, and $p_n$. We investigate the final sizes of the active red ($A^{*(n)}_R$) and black ($A^{*(n)}_B$) node sets across different parameter regimes. For each regime, we determine the relevant time scale and provide detailed characterization of asymptotic dynamics of the two concurrent activation processes.</description>

      <title>Learning Beyond Experience: Generalizing to Unseen State Space with Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</description>

      <title>Learning From Simulators: A Theory of Simulation-Grounded Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We place SGNNs in a unified statistical framework. Under standard loss functions, they can be interpreted as amortized Bayesian predictors trained under a simulator-induced prior. Empirical risk minimization then yields convergence to the Bayes-optimal predictor under the synthetic distribution. We employ classical results on distribution shift to characterize how performance degrades when the simulator diverges from reality. Beyond these consequences, we develop SGNN-specific results: (i) conditions under which unobserved scientific parameters are learnable via simulation, and (ii) a back-to-simulation attribution method that provides mechanistic explanations of predictions by linking them to the simulations the model deems similar, with guarantees of posterior consistency.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate theoretical predictions. SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited regimes.</description>

      <title>A few notes on the asymptotic behavior of Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_p, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables s.t. $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. The from this point of view proving limit theorems for $S_n$ is natural problem, since $S_n$ mimics the behavior of $e^{\sqrt{\ln(\beta)}}$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However,
  S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{b_n}\to 0$ in $L^1$, where $b_n=(n^{1/2}(\ln(\ln(n)))^{-1/4})u_n, u_n\to\infty$. In particular $S_n/\sqrt n\to 0$. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(b_n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. Note that the corresponding problem in the Steinhaus Setting was recently resolved by \cite{Gor1}. In this paper make an attempt to shed some light on the convergence of $S_n/a_n$. Additionally, we obtain explicit estimates on hight moments of $S_n$ without restrictions on the size of the moment compared to $n$ like in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Har19}, which is of independent interest. This is achieved by a martingale argument together with the Burkholder inequality, and it has applications in a natural number theoretic combinatorial problem. Using martingale techniques we will also obtain exponential concentration inequalities for $S_n$ (in the large deviations regime)</description>
