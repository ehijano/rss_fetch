      <title>Automate Strategy Finding with LLM in Quant Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06289v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel three-stage framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a risk-aware multi-agent system for automate strategy finding in quantitative finance. Our approach addresses the brittleness of traditional deep learning models in financial applications by: employing prompt-engineered LLMs to generate executable alpha factor candidates across diverse financial data, implementing multimodal agent-based evaluation that filters factors based on market status, predictive quality while maintaining category balance, and deploying dynamic weight optimization that adapts to market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the strategy in Chinese &amp; US market regimes compared to established benchmarks. Our work extends LLMs capabilities to quantitative trading, providing a scalable architecture for financial signal extraction and portfolio construction. The overall framework significantly outperforms all benchmarks with 53.17% cumulative return on SSE50 (Jan 2023 to Jan 2024), demonstrating superior risk-adjusted performance and downside protection on the market.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Time Series: an Application for Single Stocks and Statistical Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, LLMs (Large Language Models) have been adapted for time series prediction with significant success in pattern recognition. However, the common belief is that these models are not suitable for predicting financial market returns, which are known to be almost random. We aim to challenge this misconception through a counterexample. Specifically, we utilized the Chronos model from Ansari et al.(2024) and tested both pretrained configurations and fine-tuned supervised forecasts on the largest American single stocks using data from Guijarro-Ordonnez et al.(2022). We constructed a long/short portfolio, and the performance simulation indicates that LLMs can in reality handle time series that are nearly indistinguishable from noise, demonstrating an ability to identify inefficiencies amidst randomness and generate alpha. Finally, we compared these results with those of specialized models and smaller deep learning models, highlighting significant room for improvement in LLM performance to further enhance their predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees: with Multi-Population and Non-Rational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work solves the equilibrium price formation problem for the risky stock by combining mean-field game theory with the binomial tree framework, following the classic approach of Cox, Ross &amp; Rubinstein. For agents with exponential and recursive utilities of exponential-type, we prove the existence of a unique mean-field market-clearing equilibrium and derive an explicit analytic formula for equilibrium transition probabilities of the stock price on the binomial lattice. The agents face stochastic terminal liabilities and incremental endowments that depend on unhedgeable common and idiosyncratic factors, in addition to the stock price path. We also incorporate an external order flow. Furthermore, the analytic tractability of the proposed approach allows us to extend the framework in two important directions: First, we incorporate multi-population heterogeneity, allowing agents to differ in functional forms for their liabilities, endowments, and risk coefficients. Second, we relax the rational expectations hypothesis by modeling agents operating under subjective probability measures which induce stochastically biased views on the stock transition probabilities. Our numerical examples illustrate the qualitative effects of these components on the equilibrium price distribution.</description>
