      <title>Optimal network geometry detection for weak geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network geometry, characterized by nodes with associated latent variables, is a fundamental feature of real-world networks. Still, when only the network edges are given, it may be difficult to assess whether the network contains an underlying source of geometry. This paper investigates the limits of geometry detection in networks in a wide class of models that contain geometry and power-law degrees, which include the popular hyperbolic random graph model. We specifically focus on the regime in which the geometric signal is weak, characterized by the inverse temperature $1/T&lt;1$. We show that the dependencies between edges can be tackled through Mixed-Integer Linear Problems, which lift the non-linear nature of network analysis into an exponential space in which simple linear optimization techniques can be employed. This approach allows us to investigate which subgraph and degree-based statistic is most effective at detecting the presence of an underlying geometric space. Interestingly, we show that even when the geometric effect is extremely weak, our Mixed-Integer programming identifies a network statistic that efficiently distinguishes geometric and non-geometric networks.</description>

      <title>An entropy based comparative study of regional and seasonal distributions of particulate matter in Indian cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particulate matter (PM), especially $\text{PM}_{2.5}$, is a critical air pollutant posing significant risks to human health and the environment in India. This study, using six years (2018-2024) of daily $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ data, investigates the seasonal characteristics of the distributions of $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentrations across eleven Indian cities, selected from different regions of the country. We find that, while each city has its own unique seasonal patterns, all of them show a universal exponential decay in the tail of the $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ distribution for all the seasons. However, the decay rates of this tail vary across cities, highlighting regional and seasonal disparities in pollution levels. To quantitatively characterize the {\it randomness} of the seasonal $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration distributions, we compute Shannon entropy, a key information theoretic measure. This allows for classifying cities into different groups, according to the level of randomness observed in their seasonal distributions. To further explore the inter-city relationships, we employ Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), a symmetric measure of relative entropy, to quantitatively assess the degree of similarity in the $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ distributions among different cities. Remarkably, we find that several cities show very similar distributions in the winter months, which helps us to categories them into several groups. The groups obtained from these entropy based measures, namely, individual Shannon entropy and the JSD estimate, are consistent with each other, providing a robust framework for efficient air quality management and policy-making in India.</description>

      <title>Statistically validated projection of bipartite signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite networks provide a major insight into the organisation of many real-world systems, describing the mechanisms that drive interactions between distinct groups of nodes. Of particular interest are two-mode networks whose edges admit a sign: examples are provided by human interactions with entities such as products, where agents either cast either a positive or negative vote or abstain from voting at all. One of the most relevant issues encountered when modelling a bipartite network is devising a way to obtain a monopartite projection onto the layer of interest that preserves the information encoded into the original structure as much as possible. In the present contribution, we propose an unsupervised algorithm to obtain statistically validated projections of bipartite signed networks, according to which any two nodes sharing a statistically significant number of concordant (discordant) relationships are connected by a positive (negative) edge. More precisely, we propose two variants of it, according to the way ambivalent patterns and missing ties are treated. Since assessing the statistical significance of any two nodes similarity requires a proper benchmark, here we consider four different Exponential Random Graphs, defined by global as well as local constraints, either leaving the topology free or keeping the topology fixed. Our algorithm outputs a matrix of link-specific $p-$values, from which a validated projection can be obtained upon running a multiple-hypothesis testing procedure. After testing our method on synthetic configurations output by a fully controllable generative model, we apply it to several real-world configurations: in all cases, non-trivial mesoscopic structures, induced by relationships that cannot be traced back to the constraints defining the employed benchmarks, are detected.</description>

      <title>Increasing competitiveness by imbalanced groups: The example of the 48-team FIFA World Cup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A match played in a sports tournament can be called stakeless if at least one team is indifferent to its outcome because it already has qualified or has been eliminated. Such a game threatens fairness since teams may not exert full effort without incentives. This paper suggests a novel classification for stakeless matches according to their expected outcome: they are more costly if the indifferent team is more likely to win by playing honestly. Our approach is illustrated with the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the first edition of the competition with 48 teams. We propose a novel format based on imbalanced groups, which drastically reduces the probability of stakeless matches played by the strongest teams according to Monte Carlo simulations. The new design also increases the uncertainty of match outcomes and requires fewer matches. Governing bodies in sports are encouraged to consider our innovative idea in order to enhance the competitiveness of their tournaments.</description>

      <title>Competition and survival in modern academia: A bibliometric case study of theoretical high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the career lengths of researchers in theoretical high-energy physics from 1950 to 2020. Using a cohort-based analysis and bibliometric data from 30,149 authors in three physics disciplines we observe a dramatic increase in the ratio of academic dropouts over time. Where nearly all authors prior to the 1980s remained active more than a decade after their initial publication, this was the case for 50% or less by the 2010s. Consequently, the fraction of theoretical physicists who achieve full academic careers have diminished significantly in the last four decades. Additionally, we study correlations between author survivability and potential success factors, inferring that early author productivity and collaborative efforts have become increasingly strong determinants over time. A logistic regression is utilized to interpret the empirical findings through a survival model. Performance measures further indicate that early career collaboration and productivity rates have emerged as reliable predictors of author survivability during the period in which competition has intensified. Finally, we discuss the potential impacts that these developments may have on science itself.</description>
