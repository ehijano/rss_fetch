      <title>Optimizing Symbol Visibility through Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In information visualization, the position of symbols often encodes associated data values. When visualizing data elements with both a numerical and a categorical dimension, positioning in the categorical axis admits some flexibility. This flexibility can be exploited to reduce symbol overlap, and thereby increase legibility. In this paper, we initialize the algorithmic study of optimizing symbol legibility via a limited displacement of the symbols. Specifically, we consider closed unit square symbols that need to be placed at specified $y$-coordinates. We optimize the drawing order of the symbols as well as their $x$-displacement, constrained within a rectangular container, to maximize the minimum visible perimeter over all squares. If the container has width and height at most $2$, there is a point that stabs all squares. In this case, we prove that a staircase layout is arbitrarily close to optimality and can be computed in $O(n\log n)$ time. If the width is at most $2$, there is a vertical line that stabs all squares, and in this case, we design a 2-approximation algorithm (assuming fixed container height) that runs in $O(n\log n)$ time. As it turns out that a minimum visible perimeter of 2 is always achievable with a generic construction, we measure this approximation with respect to the visible perimeter exceeding 2. We show that, despite its simplicity, the algorithm gives asymptotically optimal results for certain instances.</description>

      <title>Effective Sampling for Robot Motion Planning Through the Lens of Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based methods for motion planning, which capture the structure of the robot's free space via (typically random) sampling, have gained popularity due to their scalability, simplicity, and for offering global guarantees, such as probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality. Unfortunately, the practicality of those guarantees remains limited as they do not provide insights into the behavior of motion planners for a finite number of samples (i.e., a finite running time). In this work, we harness lattice theory and the concept of $(\delta,\epsilon)$-completeness by Tsao et al. (2020) to construct deterministic sample sets that endow their planners with strong finite-time guarantees while minimizing running time. In particular, we introduce a highly-efficient deterministic sampling approach based on the $A_d^*$ lattice, which is the best-known geometric covering in dimensions $\leq 21$. Using our new sampling approach, we obtain at least an order-of-magnitude speedup over existing deterministic and uniform random sampling methods for complex motion-planning problems. Overall, our work provides deep mathematical insights while advancing the practical applicability of sampling-based motion planning.</description>
