      <title>In situ Study of Phase Transitions in La$_2$NiO$_{4+\delta}$ using Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_{4+\delta}$ has attracted increasing interest in recent years, both as oxygen electrode in solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysers due to its high electrochemical activity at intermediate to high temperatures, and as key component of memristive devices for neuromorphic computing, owing to its variable oxygen stoichiometry. The integration of La$_2$NiO$_{4+\delta}$ into devices operating at different temperatures and oxygen partial pressures requires knowledge of the effects of hyper-stoichiometry ($\delta$) on its crystalline structure. La$_2$NiO$_{4+\delta}$ is known to accommodate oxygen at interstitial sites allowing for large delta values, up to ~ 0.16. In addition, the O-doping - temperature phase diagram is known to be complex, exhibiting several phase transitions with increasing delta. Herein, we use Raman spectroscopy to monitor the effects of O-doping in the phase diagram and the various structures it contains. Throughout this work, we studied this material in its usual ceramic form, as well as in the form of thin films. Results are discussed in terms of phase transitions, chemical expansion, and some of the possible consequences of the low mean grain size inherent to such thin films.</description>

      <title>Magnetocrystalline anisotropy of FeNi and FeCo along the Bain path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnetic anisotropy in materials with non-critical elements to determine which symmetry conditions and atomic shell filling favor enhanced magnetic anisotropy. We study the magnetocrystalline anisotropies (MCA) of the equiatomic ferrous compounds FeCo and FeNi using ab initio calculations and analytical approaches via the diatomic pair model. We find that when these materials undergo a Bain transformation, that is, the variation of the a and c lattice parameters adjust to interpolate between the B2 and L10 structural phases while keeping the unit cell volume constant, the MCA versus r = c/a ratio varies differently for FeCo and FeNi despite Co and Ni differing only by one valence electron. To uncover the physics governing these trends, we use a diatomic pair model to perform a theoretical analysis of the ab initio results. We find that the MCA variation along the Bain path is correlated with the structural phase of the material as well as the occupation of (l, m)-resolved states for each equiatomic ferrous compound. Accordingly, the MCA was found to differ depending on the element paired with Fe to form the Fe-X compound (X = Co, Ni). Our work could help guide the scientific community in solving the supply crisis of hard/strong permanent magnets that are crucial for various technological applications such as those depending on motors and generators for energy conversion and clean energy applications.</description>

      <title>Searching for evidence of strengthening by short-range order in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of strength to short-range order (SRO) in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy remains hotly debated, with conflicting reports supporting and opposing SRO-induced strengthening continuing to emerge. A direct understanding of this effect remains elusive, due to difficulties in the quantification of SRO. Here, we deliver a structurally agnostic analysis that searches for unusual patterns in crystal size effects as evidence of SRO-induced strengthening. For this purpose, we assemble a large dataset of strengthening measurements drawn from a range of thermomechanical processing conditions known to produce SRO. Based on a comparative analysis with pure metal benchmarks, we find no evidence for significant coupling of SRO to strengthening in CrCoNi, and that patterns interpreted as a positive finding are likely explained by cross-study measurement scatter. Nevertheless, we leverage our analysis to provide an upper bound estimate of SRO-induced strengthening in the unlikely scenario where other sources of scatter are negligible.</description>

      <title>About the Strain-Coupled Molecular Dynamics in the Ferroelastic Phase Transition of TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tetramethylammonium (TMA) cadmium azide, is a new perovskite-like compound which undergoes a series of first-order phase transitions, including a ferroelastic transition above room temperature. Understanding the order-disorder structural phase transition (SPT) mechanism in hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) is crucial for designing new compounds with enhanced barocaloric efficiency, as well as unlocking other multifunctional properties. In this paper, we employed the energy fluctuation (EF) model to investigate the experimental linewidth of Raman modes in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ near the critical phase transition temperature ($T_C = {322}{K}$), aiming to gain insights into the molecular dynamics around the SPT. The temperature dependence of the strain, used as an order parameter, was obtained using the appropriate thermodynamic potential for the first-order phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, expressed through a Landau expansion, which can be successfully employed to model first-order ferroelastic phase transitions. We show that the EF model suitably captures the behavior of the Raman linewidths in the vicinity of the structural phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The activation energies obtained for TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ are comparable to those of DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, as well as to $k_B T_C$. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the relaxation reveals that the torsional and librational modes require longer to renormalize after the phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ when compared with DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The discussion based on these new parameters provides a new perspective for understanding molecular dynamics in systems undergoing order-disorder phase transitions, particularly in ferroelastic transitions, where order-disorder mechanisms are coupled to symmetry-breaking lattice distortions.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Fabrication of Tailored Defect Structures in 2D Materials using Machine Learning-enabled Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with tailored quantum properties can be engineered from atomic scale assembly techniques, but existing methods often lack the agility and accuracy to precisely and intelligently control the manufacturing process. Here we demonstrate a fully autonomous approach for fabricating atomic-level defects using electron beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that combines advanced machine learning and automated beam control. As a proof of concept, we achieved controlled fabrication of MoS-nanowire (MoS-NW) edge structures by iterative and targeted exposure of $MoS_2$ monolayer to a focused electron beam to selectively eject sulfur atoms, utilizing high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging for feedback-controlled monitoring structural evolution of defects. A machine learning framework combining a random forest model and convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to decode the HAADF image and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level information was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform, which applied predefined fabrication strategies to instruct beam control about atomic sites to be ejected. The selected sites were subsequently exposed to localized electron beam using an FPGA-controlled scan routine with precise control over beam positioning and duration. While the MoS-NW edge structures produced exhibit promising mechanical and electronic properties, the proposed autonomous fabrication framework is material-agnostic and can be extended to other 2D materials for the creation of diverse defect structures and heterostructures beyond $MoS_2$.</description>

      <title>LOMS.cz: A computational platform for high-throughput Classical and Combinatorial Judd-Ofelt analysis and rare-earth spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LOMS.cz (Luminescence, Optical and Magneto-optical Software), an open-source computational platform that addresses the long-standing challenge of standardizing Judd-Ofelt (JO) calculations in rare-earth spectroscopy. Despite JO theory's six-decade history as the fundamental framework for understanding $4f\leftrightarrow4f$ transitions, the field lacks standardized computational methodologies for precise and reproducible parameter determination. LOMS integrates three key innovations: (1) automated computation of JO parameters, transition probabilities, branching ratios, and theoretical radiative lifetimes, (2) a dynamically expanding database of experimentally validated parameters enabling direct comparison between computed and empirical results, and (3) a novel Combinatorial JO (C-JO) analysis algorithm that systematically identifies optimal absorption band combinations to ensure reliable parameter extraction. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate how this computational framework enables rapid screening of spectroscopic parameters, allowing researchers to predict optical properties with enhanced reliability. By combining automated analysis with experimental validation through its integrated database, LOMS.cz establishes a standardized platform for accelerating the discovery and optimization of rare-earth-based photonic and optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-based direct reduction of multicomponent oxides: Insights from powder and pre-sintered precursors toward sustainable alloy design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The co-reduction of metal oxide mixtures using hydrogen as a reductant in conjunction with compaction and sintering of the evolving metallic blends offers a promising alternative toward sustainable alloy production through a single, integrated, and synergistic process. Herein, we provide fundamental insights into hydrogen-based direct reduction (HyDR) of distinct oxide precursors that differ by phase composition and morphology. Specifically, we investigate the co-reduction of multicomponent metal oxides targeting a 25Co-25Fe-25Mn-25Ni (at.%) alloy, by using either a compacted powder (mechanically mixed oxides) comprising Co3O4-Fe2O3-Mn2O3-NiO or a pre-sintered compound (chemically mixed oxides) comprising a Co,Ni-rich halite and a Fe,Mn-rich spinel. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10 {\deg}C/min reveals that the reduction onset temperature for the compacted powder was ~175 {\deg}C, whereas it was significantly delayed to ~525 {\deg}C for the pre-sintered sample. Nevertheless, both sample types attained a similar reduction degree (~80%) after isothermal holding for 1 h at 700 {\deg}C. Phase analysis and microstructural characterization of reduced samples confirmed the presence of metallic Co, Fe, and Ni alongside MnO. A minor fraction of Fe remains unreduced, stabilized in the (Fe,Mn)O halite phase, in accord with thermodynamic calculations. Furthermore, ~1 wt.% of BCC phase was found only in the reduced pre-sintered sample, owing to the different reduction pathways. The kinetics and thermodynamics effects were decoupled by performing HyDR experiments on pulverized pre-sintered samples. These findings demonstrate that initial precursor states influence both the reduction behavior and the microstructural evolution, providing critical insights for the sustainable production of multicomponent alloys.</description>

      <title>Forbidden p-d Orbital Coupling Accelerates High-Power-Factor Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic entanglement between electrical conductivity ($\sigma$) and the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) significantly constrains power factor (PF) enhancement in thermoelectric (TE) materials. While high valley degeneracy ($N_{\mathrm{vk}}$) effectively balances $\sigma$ and $S$ to improve PF, identifying compounds with high $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$ remains challenging. In this study, we develop an effective approach to rapid discover $p$-type semiconductors with high $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$ through manipulating anion-$p$ and cation-$d$ orbital coupling. By prohibiting $p$-$d$ orbital coupling at the $\Gamma$ point, the valence band maximum shifts away from the $\Gamma$ point (where $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$=1), thereby increasing $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$. Through the examination of the common irreducible representations of anion-$p$ and cation-$d$ orbitals at the $\Gamma$ point, we identify 7 compounds with $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$ $\ge$ 6 from 921 binary and ternary semiconductors. First-principles calculations with electron-phonon coupling demonstrate that PtP$_2$, PtAs$_2$, and PtS$_2$ exhibit exceptionally high PFs of 130, 127, and 82 $\mu$Wcm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ at 300K, respectively, which are three to five times higher than those of the well-studied TE materials. This work not only elucidates the underlying mechanism of high $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$ formation through group theory, but also establishes an efficient high-PF material discovery paradigm, extended to more complex systems.</description>

      <title>TeO2-BaO-Bi2O3 tellurite optical glasses II. -- Linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties of TeO$_2$-BaO-Bi$_2$O$_3$ (TeBaBi) glasses prepared by the conventional melt-quenching technique at 900 {\deg}C. Prepared glass composition ranges across the whole glass-forming-ability (GFA) region focusing on mutual substitution trends of constituent oxides, where TeO$_2$: 55-85 mol.%, BaO: 10-35 mol.%, Bi$_2$O$_3$: 5-15 mol.%. Studied glasses exhibit high values of linear ($n_{632} \approx$ 1.922-2.084) and non-linear refractive index ($n_2\approx$1.63-3.45$\times10^{-11}$ esu), Verdet constant ($V_{632} \approx$ 26.7-45.3 radT$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$) and optical band gap energy ($E_g \approx$ 3.1-3.6 eV). The introduction of TeO$_2$ and Bi$_2$O$_3$ results in increase of both linear/non-linear refractive index and Verdet constant, with a more pronounced influence of Bi$_2$O$_3$. Measured spectral dispersion of refractive index and Verdet constant were used for estimation of magneto-optic anomaly parameter ($\gamma \approx$ 0.71-0.92), which may be used for theoretical modelling of magneto-optic response in diamagnetic TeBaBi glasses. Additionally, the properties of the prepared TeBaBi glasses were directly compared to those of the TeO$_2$-ZnO-BaO glass system, which was prepared and characterized under similar experimental conditions. The compositional dependence of the refractive index in both glass systems was described using multilinear regression analysis, demonstrating high correlation and uniformity of estimation across the entire GFA region. This makes them highly promising for precise dispersion engineering and construction of optical devices operating from visible to mid-infrared spectral region.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and defect properties of Bi-doped GaN: origins of photoluminescence and optical absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme lattice-mismatched III-V nitrides, such as Bi-incorporated GaN, have been realized experimentally thanks to recent advances in epitaxial growth and characterization techniques. However, theoretical insights into defect-related optical absorption and emission phenomena in these materials remain scarce. Here, we apply hybrid density functional theory to systematically explore the role of substitutional bismuth atoms on both cationic $\mathrm{Bi_{Ga}}$ and anionic $\mathrm{Bi_{N}}$ sites in Bi-incorporated GaN, as well as their complexes with native vacancies. Our calculations reveal that the charge-compensated defect complexes $(\mathrm{Bi_{N}} + \mathrm{V_{Ga}})^{3-}$ and $(\mathrm{Bi_{N}} + \mathrm{V_{Ga}})^{3+}$ stabilize anionic bismuth incorporation, accounting for the experimentally observed absorption peaks at ~1.11 eV and ~3.17 eV. We further uncover the origins of the reported band-edge emissions near 2.0 eV and 2.5 eV by examining various charge states of $\mathrm{Bi_{Ga}}$ and $\mathrm{Bi_{N}}$ centers. Our findings elucidate the defect-level physics of Bi-doped GaN and provide practical guidelines for controlling the incorporation of Bi into GaN.</description>

      <title>Reliable Magnetometry for Antiferromagnets and Thin Films: Correcting Substrate Artifacts in Mn3Sn/MgO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic spintronics has led to increased interest in magnetic materials with vanishing net magnetization but strong spin-dependent transport properties. As thin films of such materials become central to device concepts, precise magnetic characterization is essential, for quantify intrinsic moments, and interpret transport signatures such as the anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we show that commercial MgO substrates, commonly used in epitaxial growth, often produce substantial parasitic magnetic signals that can match or exceed the response of weakly magnetic films. We identify two major components: a low-field ferromagnetic-like contribution originating from epi-ready surface, and a temperature-dependent paramagnetic background associated with dilute bulk impurities. These artifacts vary between samples and cannot be corrected using standard linear background subtraction or a measured reference substrate. To address this, we develop and put forward a compensation scheme which combines two complementary, non-destructive measurement protocols. We demonstrate up to 97% efficacy without requiring prior measurements of the bare substrate. The proposed framework enables reliable extraction of intrinsic magnetic signals and provides a general strategy for high-fidelity magnetometry in weakly magnetic thin-film systems, including emerging classes of materials such as topological phases and two-dimensional magnets. We also report the diamagnetic susceptibility of crystalline MgO, chi_MgO = -4.0 x 10^-7 emu/g/Oe.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anharmonic Effects in Hydrogen-Bond Symmetrization of High-Pressure Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear quantum effects of hydrogen play a significant role in determining the phase stability of water ice. Hydrogen-bond symmetrization occurs as hydrogen atoms tunnel in a double-well potential, ultimately occupying the midpoint between oxygen atoms and transforming ice VIII into ice X under high pressure. Quantum fluctuations lower this transition from classical predictions of over 100 GPa to 60 GPa. We reveal that the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional underestimates the hydrogen double-well barrier, thus resulting in a transition pressure over 10 GPa lower than the strongly constrained and appropriately normed functional, which is validated against quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Nuclear quantum anharmonicity, treated via neural canonical transformation (NCT), reveals that this transition pressure is temperature-independent and observes a 2 GPa reduction when comparing the non-Gaussian flow models based wavefunction compared to the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Despite increasing pressure typically shortens chemical bonds and hardens phonon modes, NCT calculations reveal that hydrogen bond softens hydrogen-oxygen stretching in ice VIII upon pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics are emerging as advanced functional materials and are fertile ground for unusual electric effects. For example, they enhance the recoverable energy density in energy storage applications and give rise to large electromechanical responses. Here, we demonstrate noncollinearity in dipolar order as an additional degree of freedom, unlocking physical properties that are symmetry-forbidden in classical antiferroelectrics. We show that noncollinear order of electric dipole moments in K$_3$[Nb$_3$O$_6$|(BO$_3$)$_2$] leads to a coexistence of antiferroelectric and ferroelectric behaviors. Besides the double-hysteresis loop observed in antiferroelectrics, a pronounced piezoresponse and electrically switchable domains are observed, separated by atomically sharp and micrometer-long charged domain walls. Hybrid antiferroelectric-ferroelectric responses are expected in a wide range of noncollinear systems, giving a new dimension to the research on antiferroelectrics and multifunctional oxides in general.</description>

      <title>Tailoring hard magnetic properties of Fe2MnSn Heusler alloy via interstitial modification: A first-principles approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ first-principles calculations to explore interstitial engineering as a strategy to tailor the hard magnetic properties of Fe2MnSn Heusler alloy, establishing its potential as a rare-earth-free permanent magnet. By introducing light interstitial elements -- B, C, H, N, O, and F -- at varying concentrations (1.56-12.5 at%), we uncover significant enhancements in structural stability, magnetization, Curie temperature, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These dopants preferentially occupy octahedral interstitial sites in the hexagonal phase of Fe2MnSn, leading to localized lattice distortions that enhance its magnetic characteristics. Notably, at 12.5 at% doping, B, C, N, and O induce a critical transition from in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy -- achieved without 5d or rare-earth elements -- highlighting a sustainable pathway to high-performance magnets. Among these, N-doped Fe2MnSn exhibits the highest uniaxial anisotropy (0.61 MJ/m^3), followed by the B-doped (0.44 MJ/m^3) alloy. The magnetization of the doped compounds surpasses that of conventional ferrites and gap magnets like MnAl and MnBi. The Curie temperature sees a substantial boost, reaching 1058 K for O-doped Fe2MnSn and 1000 K for the C-doped alloy. Although N-doping results in a modest increase in Tc (744 K vs. 729 K for the pristine alloy), it delivers superior hard magnetic properties, with the highest magnetic hardness (0.65) and an enhanced maximum energy product (0.36 MJ/m^3), making it a strong candidate for gap magnet applications. These findings highlight interstitial doping as a viable route to engineer rare-earth-free permanent magnets with optimized magnetic performance.</description>

      <title>Data-driven high-throughput search for the accelerated discovery of rare-earth-free permanent magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrated data-driven approach combined with a high-throughput framework based on first-principles calculations was used to discover novel rare-earth-free permanent magnets, focusing on binary alloys. Compounds were screened systematically based on their elemental composition, structure, stability, and magnetization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the selected candidates to evaluate their magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) and Curie temperature (Tc), resulting in the identification of ten promising materials. A thorough literature review was done to assess reports of prior existence, which confirmed the novelty of ZnFe and Fe8N. Their ferromagnetic ground state was re-established through DFT, and structural stability was confirmed via negative formation enthalpies, phonon spectra, and elastic criteria. Tetragonal ZnFe and Fe8N exhibit high saturation magnetization (&gt;1 T), large anisotropy constants (&gt;0.5 MJ/m^3), and high Tc (&gt;1200 K). Their magnetic hardness parameters (kappa = 0.85 for ZnFe and 0.70 for Fe8N) further support their potential as gap magnets. These findings highlight the efficacy of our high-throughput screening, which may serve as a theoretical blueprint for the experimental realization of these materials.</description>

      <title>1/ f noise and two-level systems in MBE-grown Al thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum thin films are essential to the functionalities of electronic and quantum devices, where two-level systems (TLS) can degrade device performance. MBE-grown Al films may appeal to these applications due to their low TLS densities. We studied the energy distributions of TLS densities, g(E), in 10-nm-thick MBE-grown and electron-beam evaporated Al films through 1/f noise measurements between 80 and 360 K. At 300 K, the noise magnitudes in MBE-grown films are about three times lower than in the electron-beam evaporated films, corresponding to the g(E) values about ten times lower in the former than in the latter. Compared with previously established observations, we identified that the 1/f noise was generated by thermally activated TLS at grain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Advancing Magnetic Materials Discovery -- A structure-based machine learning approach for magnetic ordering and magnetic moment prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting magnetic behavior across diverse materials systems remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex interplay of structural and electronic factors and is pivotal for the accelerated discovery and design of next-generation magnetic materials. In this work, a refined descriptor is proposed that significantly improves the prediction of two critical magnetic properties -- magnetic ordering (Ferromagnetic vs. Ferrimagnetic) and magnetic moment per atom -- using only the structural information of materials. Unlike previous models limited to Mn-based or lanthanide-transition metal compounds, the present approach generalizes across a diverse dataset of 5741 stable, binary and ternary, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds sourced from the Materials Project. Leveraging an enriched elemental vector representation and advanced feature engineering, including nonlinear terms and reduced matrix sparsity, the LightGBM-based model achieves an accuracy of 82.4% for magnetic ordering classification and balanced recall across FM and FiM classes, addressing a key limitation in prior studies. The model predicts magnetic moment per atom with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, surpassing the Hund's matrix and orbital field matrix descriptors. Additionally, it accurately estimates formation energy per atom, enabling assessment of both magnetic behavior and material stability. This generalized and computationally efficient framework offers a robust tool for high-throughput screening of magnetic materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain. We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence (up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of Norway spruce have revealed stress-state-dependent normalized creep behavior, highlighting a gap in our fundamental understanding. This study examines whether the anisotropic response originates from the micro-structural, cellular nature of composite cell walls with varying tracheid types. Cell wall creep parameters are identified via surrogate-based inverse parameter identification, applied to hierarchical micro-mechanical and FEM models of increasing topological complexity up to the growth ring scale. Despite microstructural disorder, simulated creep curves converge toward a universal set of proportionality factors. The results indicate that directional creep behavior cannot be attributed solely to tissue-scale topology, and that realistic predictions require the inclusion of non-linear material responses at stress concentration sites.</description>

      <title>Trade-Offs in EuBa2Cu3Oy Films containing Artificial Pinning Centers: Higher Critical Currents yet Faster Vortex Creep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic properties of type-II superconductors depend on vortices-magnetic flux lines whose motion introduces dissipation that can be mitigated by pinning from material defects. The material disorder landscape is tuned by the choice of materials growth technique and incorporation of impurities that serve as vortex pinning centers. For example, metal organic deposition (MOD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) produce high-quality superconducting films with uncorrelated versus correlated disorder, respectively. Here, we study vortex dynamics in PLD-grown EuBa2Cu3Oy films containing varying concentrations of BaHfO3 inclusions and compare our results with those of MOD-grown (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy films. Despite both systems exhibiting behavior consistent with strong pinning theory, which predicts the critical current density J_c based on vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical inclusions, we find striking differences in the vortex dynamics owing to the correlated versus uncorrelated disorder. Specifically, we find that the EuBa2Cu3Oy films grown without inclusions exhibit surprisingly slow vortex creep, comparable to the slowest creep rates achieved in (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy films containing high concentrations of BaHfO3. Whereas adding inclusions to (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy is effective in slowing creep, BaHfO3 increases creep in EuBa2Cu3Oy even while concomitantly improving J_c. Lastly, we find evidence of variable range hopping and that J_c is maximized at the BaHfO3 concentration that hosts a vortex or Bose glass state.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-loss diamond nanomechanics enabled by van der Waals self-assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical systems are critical platforms for precision measurement, sensing, macroscopic quantum physics, and emerging quantum-information technologies. In these applications, high mechanical quality factors, often achieved using dissipation dilution, are important since they directly enhance measurement sensitivity and quantum coherence. However, surface stiction intrinsic to nanoscale structures severely limits their performance. Here, we transform this longstanding obstacle into a solution for tension-enabled dissipation dilution, via a novel van der Waals (vdW) self-assembly method. Leveraging intrinsic nanoscale surface interactions, we achieve controlled tensile stresses up to 1.3GPa in single-crystal diamond--an ideal but notoriously difficult material to strain-engineer--without introducing additional interface losses. We demonstrate mechanical quality factors exceeding 100 million at 5K, surpassing state-of-the-art systems at comparable aspect ratios. This versatile approach, applicable to other crystalline materials, opens up avenues using cryogenic nanomechanical systems for ultra-precise quantum sensing, tests of quantum gravity, and hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water, a subject of human fascination for millennia, is likely the most studied substance on Earth, with an entire scientific field -- hydrodynamics -- dedicated to understanding water in motion. However, when water flows through one-dimensional or two-dimensional channels, its behavior deviates substantially from the principles of hydrodynamics. This is because reducing the dimensionality of any interacting physical system amplifies interaction effects that are beyond the reach of traditional hydrodynamic equations. In low-dimensional water, hydrogen bonds can become stable enough to arrange water molecules into an ordered state, causing water to behave not only like a liquid but also like a solid in certain respects. In this review, we explore the relationship between water's ordering and its ability to flow in low-dimensional channels, using viscosities of bulk water, vapor, and ice as benchmarks. We also provide a brief overview of the key theoretical approaches available for such analyses and discuss ionic transport, which is heavily influenced by the molecular structure of water.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ground State and Spin Excitations in the 2D Trimerized Collinear-II Lattice Antiferromagnet Li2Ni3P4O14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the magnetic ground state, spin excitations, and spin Hamiltonian of the 2D spin-1 trimerized Heisenberg antiferromagnet Li2Ni3P4O14. Below the magnetic ordering temperature TN = 14.5 K, the compound exhibits a canted long-range antiferromagnetic order with a propagation vector k = (0 0 0), consistent with the magnetic space group P21/c.1 (No. 14.75). The ground state magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic spin-trimers of Ni2+ ions. The spin-trimers are coupled antiferromagnetically along the c-axis and ferromagnetically along the a-axis. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) reveals gapped and dispersive magnon excitations below the TN, and gapless quasi-elastic scatterings at higher temperature. The linear spin-wave theory simulations reveal the essential features of the excitation spectrum; by a spin Hamiltonian composed of ferromagnetic intra-trimer exchange interaction J1 and inter-trimer exchange interactions J2 (FM) and J3(AFM) within the bc plane. The J2 and J3 along the b-axis and c-axis, respectively, with strengths of J2/J1=0.79 and J3/J1=-0.91. In addition, a weak inter planer ferromagnetic exchange interaction J4 (|J4/J1|~0.12) is found along the a-axis. The determined exchange constants reveal a 2D trimerized Collinear-II spin lattice within the bc-plane. The analysis of INS spectra by linear spin-wave theory also yields a moderate single-ion anisotropy (D/J1=0.48) which accounts for the observed spin gap below TN as well as the metamagnetic transition near 44 kOe in dc magnetization (M vs H) curves. These findings identify Li2Ni3P4O14 as a rare realization of a two-dimensional trimerized spin system and offer the direct experimental confirmation of theoretically predicted magnon excitations, unveiling the fundamental characteristics of the expected excitation spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally report a hitherto unseen angular anisotropy in the polarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross section of a magnetically strongly inhomogeneous material. Based on an analytical prediction using micromagnetic theory, the difference between the spin-up and spin-down SANS cross sections is expected to show a spin-disorder-induced anisotropy. The effect is particularly pronounced in inhomogeneous magnetic materials, such as nanoporous ferromagnets, magnetic nanocomposites, or steels, which exhibit large nanoscale jumps in the saturation magnetization at internal pore-matrix or particle-matrix interfaces. Analysis of the experimental neutron data constitutes a method for determining the exchange-stiffness constant. Our results are generic to the nuclear-magnetic interference terms contained in the polarized magnetic neutron scattering cross section and might also be of relevance to other neutron techniques.</description>

Abstract: Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated, using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural characterization.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon vertex correction effect in superconducting H3S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) formalism provides a reliable framework for describing phonon-mediated superconductivity in the adiabatic regime, where the electronic Fermi energy exceeds the characteristic phonon energy. In this work, we go beyond this limit by incorporating first-order vertex corrections to the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction within the Eliashberg formalism and assess their impact on the superconducting properties of H3S and Pb using first-principles calculations. For H3S, where the adiabatic assumption breaks down, we find that vertex corrections to the e-ph coupling are substantial. When combined with phonon anharmonicity and the energy dependence of the electronic density of states, the predicted critical temperature (Tc) is in very good agreement with experimental observations. In contrast, for elemental Pb, where the adiabatic approximation remains valid, vertex corrections have a negligible effect, and the calculated Tc and superconducting gap closely match the predictions of the standard ME formalism. These findings demonstrate the importance of non-adiabatic corrections in strongly coupled high-Tc hydrides and establish a robust first-principles framework for accurately predicting superconducting properties across different regimes.</description>

      <title>The impact of process steps on nearly ideal subthreshold slope in 300-mm compatible InGaZnO TFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While we demonstrate a back-gated (BG) amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (a-IGZO) transistors with a nearly ideal subthreshold slope (SS) ~ 60 mV/dec. However, SS degrades when a top-gated (TG) configuration is implemented. The energy distribution of traps inferred from temperature-dependent (T = 4 K - 300 K) and multi-frequency (f = 1 kHz - 100 kHz) admittance measurements, reveals a much higher trap density in TG devices. By analyzing the impact of each process step and conducting forming gas anneal (FGA) experiments, we reveal the role of hydrogen in the deterioration of the SS in the IGZO-based transistors.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties of CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 by first-principles calculations</title>

Abstract: In the present work, the density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized-gradient approximation developed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) +U method, i.e., PBE+U, was employed to predict temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties of the rutile-type oxides CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 as well as the binary oxides Cr2O3, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5 via the quasiharmonic phonon approach (QHA). Calculated thermodynamic properties of the binary oxides were benchmarked with experimental data, showing high accuracy except for the negative thermal expansion (NTE) of Nb2O5, attributed to its polymorphic complexity. By combining the formation energy predicted by DFT with the existing SGTE Substances Database (SSUB5), the CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 are found to be thermodynamic stable up to 1706 K and 1926 K and decompose into Cr2O3 and Nb2O5 or Ta2O5 at those temperatures, respectively. The temperature dependence of linear thermal expansion coefficients for CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 are predicted, and their mean values from 500 K to 2000 K are found to be 6.0*10-6/K and 5.04*10-6/K, respectively, in agreement with experimental observations in the literature. The gas-phase species and their vapor pressure are calculated, indicating that the formation of CrTaO4 and CrNbO4 reduces chromium volatilization, which is critically important to design enhanced Refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) with enhanced oxidation resistance.</description>

      <title>Pisarenko's Formula for the Thermopower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermopower $\alpha$ (also known as the Seebeck coefficient) is one of the most fundamental material characteristics for understanding charge carrier transport in thermoelectric materials. Here, we revisit the Pisarenko formula for the thermopower, which was traditionally considered valid only for non-degenerate semiconductors. We demonstrate that regardless of the dominating scattering mechanism, the Pisarenko formula describes accurately enough the relationship between thermopower $\alpha$ and charge carrier concentration $n$ beyond the non-degenerate limit. Moreover, the Pisarenko formula provides a simple thermopower-conductivity relation, $\alpha = \pm \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}}{e} (b - \ln \sigma)$, valid for materials with $\alpha &gt; 90$ $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ when acoustic phonon scattering is predominant. This offers an alternative way to analyze electron transport when Hall measurements are difficult or inaccessible. Additionally, we show how the Pisarenko formula can be used to estimate the maximum power factor of a thermoelectric material from the weighted mobility of a single, not necessarily optimized, sample at any given temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The contribution of flexoelectric coupling to the long-range order parameter fluctuations in ferroics can be critically important to the ferron dispersion and related polar, pyroelectric and electrocaloric properties. Here we calculate analytically the dispersion relations of soft optic and acoustic flexocoupling-induced phonons and ferrons by incorporating the flexoelectric coupling, damping, and higher elastic gradients in the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional using the van der Waals uniaxial ferrielectric CuInP2S6 as an example. We analyze the changes in the flexocoupling-induced phonon and ferron spectra arising from the appearance of spatially modulated phases induced by the flexoelectric coupling. We show that the free energy landscape of CuInP2S6 determines the specific features of its phonon spectra and ferron dispersion. We also discuss the contributions of optic and acoustic flexocoupling-induced ferrons to the pyroelectric and electrocaloric responses of CuInP2S6 at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Pathways to crystal chirality An algorithm to identify new displacive chiral phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that integrates pseudosymmetry search with first-principles calculations to systematically identify achiral parent structures and establish potential chiral displacive transitions linking them to their corresponding chiral phases within the 22 enantiomorphic space groups. This approach enables a robust exploration of structural relationships, offering new insights into symmetry-driven properties. Our workflow streamlines the discovery of displacive chiral phase transitions driven by soft phonon modes, providing insights into the mechanisms of structural chirality in inorganic materials. We apply this methodology on the chiral phases of TeO$_2$, Na$_2$SeO$_9$, Sr$_2$As$_2$O$_7$, As$_2$O$_5$, Rb$_2$Be$_2$O$_3$, and CaTe$_2$O$_3$. Demonstrating that some do not have a minimal supergroup that allows for an achiral phase; some can have a minimal supergroup, still, no unstable phonon mode exists in the achiral phase; and somewhere the minimal supergroup exists with a soft phonon mode connecting the identified achiral phase and the chiral phase through small continuous displacements.</description>

      <title>Sum rules for x-ray circular and linear dichroism based on complete magnetic multipole basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) are powerful spectroscopic techniques for probing magnetic properties in solids. In this study, we revisit the XMCD and XMLD sum rules within a complete magnetic multipole basis that incorporates both spinless and spinful multipoles. We demonstrate that these multipoles can be clearly distinguished and individually detected through the sum-rule formalism. Within this framework, the anisotropic magnetic dipole term is naturally derived in XMCD, offering a microscopic origin for ferromagnetic-like behavior in antiferromagnets. Furthermore, we derive the sum rules for out-of-plane and in-plane XMLD regarding electric quadrupole contributions defined based on the complete multipole basis. Our theoretical approach provides a unified, symmetry-consistent framework for analyzing dichroic signals in various magnetic materials. These findings deepen the understanding of XMCD and XMLD and open pathways to exploring complex magnetic structures and spin-orbit coupling effects in emergent magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Activation entropy helps explain anomalous flow stress temperature dependence in copper</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal activation of dislocations is critical for predicting the mechanical response of materials under common experimental conditions. According to transition state theory (TST), the rate for the system to overcome free energy barriers depends on an attempt frequency, activation free energy, and temperature. We computed the rate for edge and screw dislocation dipoles to overcome their interaction fields at various temperatures, Langevin friction coefficients, and shear stresses using Molecular Dynamics (MD), Schoecks entropy formalism and compared with Kramers rate theory. Kramers theory matches the rates computed dynamically, which depend on Langevin friction, increasing with weaker friction. Statically, using Schoeck formalism to compute the entropy along the minimum energy path (MEP), we found significant entropic effects that lead to an increase of the critical resolved shear stress with temperature and could help explain the long-standing anomaly observed at low to intermediate temperatures in copper and other metals, where the flow stress increases with temperature.</description>

      <title>Quasi-symmetry Constrained Spin Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry and their spin-orbit coupling (SOC) allow for an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that depends on the direction of the N\'eel ordering vector. The AHE and the ferromagnetic spin moment share the same symmetry and hence are usually proportional. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations find that the AHE exists with negligible ferromagnetic spin moment for some compounds, whereas it reaches sizable values for other altermagnets. By examining realistic minimal models for altermagnetism in which the DFT phenomenology is captured, we uncover a general SOC-enabled quasi-symmetry, the uniaxial spin space-group, that provides a natural explanation for the amplitude of the ferromagnetic spin moment across the vast range of different altermagnetic materials. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the magnetic anisotropy energy, providing a simple means to identify the preferred N\'eel vector orientation for altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Text to Band Gap: Pre-trained Language Models as Encoders for Semiconductor Band Gap Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of transformer-based language models, RoBERTa, T5, and LLaMA, for predicting the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from textual representations that encode key material features such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, number of atoms per unit cell, valence electron count, and other relevant electronic and structural properties. Quantum chemistry simulations such as DFT provide accurate predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their feasibility for large-scale materials screening. Shallow ML models offer faster alternatives but typically require extensive data preprocessing to convert non-numerical material features into structured numerical inputs, often at the cost of losing critical descriptive information. In contrast, our approach leverages pretrained language models to process textual data directly, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. We construct material descriptions in two formats: structured strings that combine key features in a consistent template, and natural language narratives generated using the ChatGPT API. For each model, we append a custom regression head and perform task-specific finetuning on a curated dataset of inorganic compounds. Our results show that finetuned language models, particularly the decoder-only LLaMA-3 architecture, can outperform conventional approaches in prediction accuracy and flexibility, achieving an MAE of 0.25 eV and R2 of 0.89, compared to the best shallow ML baseline, which achieved an MAE of 0.32 eV and R2 of 0.84. Notably, LLaMA-3 achieves competitive accuracy with minimal finetuning, suggesting its architecture enables more transferable representations for scientific tasks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of finetuned language models for scientific property prediction and provides a scalable, language-native framework for materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Applied-field magnetic structure and spectroscopy shifts of the effective spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, $XY$-like magnet Li$_2$CoCl$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insulators containing chains of magnetic transition metal cations provide platforms for probing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dynamics and quantum critical behavior. Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ contains edge-sharing CoCl$_6$ octahedra that form chains along the crystallographic $c$ axis and orders antiferromagnetically at zero field, but questions remain about its applied-field magnetic structure and the Co$^{2+}$ spin state. Here, we show with neutron diffraction on a polycrystalline sample how the anti-aligned chains of cobalt moments undergo a spin-flop transition to a field-aligned ferromagnetic state above 1.6 T. Further, using magnetic resonance absorption measurements and paramagnetic spin models, we reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the Co$^{2+}$ ion's $XY$-like magnetic behavior ($g_{\parallel}=2.77$ and $g_{\perp}=5.23$) and its $J=\frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We, therefore, supply the magnetic structures and anisotropic description needed to explore the dynamics of the field-driven magnetic phases, laying the foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog computers hold promise to significantly reduce the energy consumption of artificial intelligence algorithms, but commercialization has been hampered by a fundamental scientific challenge - how to reliably store and process analog information with high precision. We present an approach based upon metal oxide memory cells that undergo controlled self-heating during programming with a newly developed, electro-thermo-chemical gate. The gate uniformly spreads heat and electrochemical reactions to enable wide, bulk-vacancy modulation which yields nine orders of magnitude in tunable analog resistance - three orders greater than other devices reported, with thousands of states. The gating profoundly reduces noise and drift to enable precision programming to targeted states within a few operations, lowering conductance errors by two orders of magnitude relative to other devices reported. Simulations show improvement in computational energy efficiency by at least 10x over other devices due to far greater scalability at higher precision. The results overturn long-held assumptions about the poor reliability and precision of analog resistance devices and opens the door to manufacturable, bulk metal-oxide devices and new applications that leverage high precision.</description>
