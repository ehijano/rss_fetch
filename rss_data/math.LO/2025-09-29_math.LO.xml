      <title>Kinds of preservations for properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study possibilities of preservations for properties, their links and related connections between semantic and syntactic ones, both in general and as characterizations for subalgebras, congruence relations, Henkin construction, Tarski-Vaught test, some graphs, and graded structures. Traces for types and related objects are studied, too.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the Automorphism group of the surreal numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the automorphism group of the field of surreal numbers. Our main structure theorem presents a decomposition of this group into a product of five significant factors. Using the representation of surreal numbers as generalized power series via their Conway normal form, we apply results on Hahn fields and groups from the literature in order to obtain this decomposition. Moreover, we provide explicit descriptions of the individual factors enabling us to construct automorphisms on the field of surreal numbers from simpler components. We then extend our study to strongly linear automorphisms in connection to derivations, as well as automorphisms that preserve further exponential structure on the surreals.</description>

      <title>Strong Kurtz Randomness and Binary Expansions of Reordered Computable Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real number is called left-computable if there exists a computable increasing sequence of rational numbers converging to it. In this article we investigate the Kolmogorov complexity and the binary expansions of a very specific subset of the left-computable numbers. We show in our main result that a real number is reordered computable if, and only if, it is left-computable and not strongly Kurtz random. In preparation of this, we characterize strong Kurtz randomness by a suitable notion of randomness tests.
  Recently, in a contribution to the conference CiE 2025, the authors looked at the binary expansions of reordered computable numbers and clarified whether they can be immune or hyperimmune. We take this topic up again and extend our analysis to the notions hyperhyperimmune, strongly hyperhyperimmune, and cohesive. It turns out that by using our main theorem and a number of well-known facts we can obtain a complete picture of the situation, obtaining shorter proofs of results in the conference paper and new results. Then, we investigate the effective Hausdorff and packing dimensions of reordered computable numbers. Finally, we have a short look at regular reals in the context of immunity properties, Kolmogorov complexity and (strong) Kurtz randomness.</description>

      <title>Almost disjoint families and some automorphic and injective properties of $\ell_\infty/c_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answering questions of A. Avil\'es, F. Cabello S\'anchez, J. Castillo, M. Gonz\'alez and Y. Moreno we show that the following statements are independent of the usual axioms ZFC with arbitrarily large continuum: for every (some) $\omega&lt;\kappa&lt;2^\omega$
  (1) any linear bounded operator $T: c_0(\kappa)\rightarrow\ell_\infty/c_0$ extends to any superspace of $c_0(\kappa)$.
  (2) any isomorphism between any two copies of $c_0(\kappa)$ inside $\ell_\infty/c_0$ extends to an automorphism of $\ell_\infty/c_0$.
  This contrasts with Boolean, Banach algebraic or isometric levels, where the objects known as Hausdorff gap and Luzin gap witness the failure in ZFC of the corresponding properties for the corresponding structures already at the first uncountable cardinal $\kappa=\omega_1$. In particular, consistently, any two pairwise disjoint families in $\wp(\mathbb N)/Fin$ of the same cardinality $\omega&lt;\kappa&lt;2^\omega$ can be mapped onto each other by a linear automorphism of $\ell_\infty/c_0$ regardless of their different combinatorial, algebraic or topological positions in $\wp(\mathbb N)/Fin$.
  Our positive consistency results use a restricted version of Martin's axiom for a partial order that adds an infinite block diagonal matrix of an operator on $\ell_\infty$ which induces an operator on $\ell_\infty/c_0$. The construction of its finite blocks relies on a lemma of Bourgain and Tzafriri on finite dimensional Banach spaces.
  Our negative consistency results rely on an analysis of almost disjoint families of $\mathbb N$, the embeddings of $c_0(\kappa)$ into $\ell_\infty/c_0$ they induce and their extensions to $\ell_\infty^c(\kappa)$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental sequences based on localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on Buchholz' assignment for ordinals below Bachmann-Howard ordinal, see Buchholz 2003, we introduce systems of fundamental sequences for two kinds of relativized $\vartheta$-function-based notation systems of strength $\Pi^1_1{\operatorname{-CA}_0}$ and prove Bachmann property for these systems, which is essential for monotonicity properties of subrecursive hierarchies defined on the basis of fundamental sequences. The central notion of our construction is the notion of localization, which was introduced in Wilken 2007.
  The first kind of stepwise defined $\vartheta$-functions over ordinal addition as basic function fits the framework of the ordinal arithmetical toolkit developed in Wilken 2007, whereas the second kind of $\vartheta$-functions is defined simultaneously and will allow for further generalization to larger proof-theoretic ordinals, see Weiermann and Wilken 2011.
  The systems of fundamental sequences given here enable the investigation of fundamental sequences and independence phenomena also in the context of patterns of resemblance, an approach to ordinal notations that is both semantic and combinatorial and was first introduced by Carlson 2001 and further analyzed in Wilken 2006, 2007, and Carlson and Wilken 2012.
  Our exposition is put into the context of the abstract approach to fundamental sequences developed by Buchholz, Cichon, and Weiermann 1994. The results of this paper will be applied to the theory of Goodstein sequences, extending results of Fern\`andez-Duque and Weiermann 2024.</description>

      <title>Properties preserved by classes of Chu transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chu spaces and Chu transforms were first investigated in category theory by Barr and Chu in 1979. In 2000 van Benthem shifted to the model-theoretic point of view by isolating a class of infinitary two-sorted properties, the flow formulas, which are preserved by all Chu transforms. D\v{z}amonja and V\"a\"an\"anen in 2021 considered a special kind of Chu transforms, satisfying a density condition. These authors used dense Chu transforms to compare abstract logics, in particular showing that such transforms preserve compactness.
  This motivates the problem of characterizing which properties are preserved by dense Chu transforms. We solve this problem by isolating the inconsistency-flow formulas, which are flow formulas with an added predicate to express inconsistency. Our main result characterizes the first-order inconsistency-flow formulas exactly as those first-order properties preserved by dense Chu transforms. Furthermore, we consider several instances of Chu transforms in concrete situations such as topological spaces, graphs and ultrafilters. In particular, we prove that Chu transforms between ultrafilters correspond to the Rudin-Keisler ordering.</description>

      <title>Duality Theory for Bounded Lattices: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are numerous generalizations of the celebrated Priestley duality for bounded distributive lattices to the non-distributive setting. The resulting dualities rely on an earlier foundational work of such authors as Nachbin, Birkhoff-Frink, Bruns-Lakser, Hofmann-Mislove-Stralka, and others. We undertake a detailed comparative study of the existing dualities for arbitrary bounded (non-distributive) lattices, including supplying the dual description of bounded lattice homomorphisms where it was lacking. This is achieved by working with relations instead of functions. As a result, we arrive at a landscape of categories that provide various generalizations of the category of Priestley spaces. We provide explicit descriptions of the functors yielding equivalences of these categories, together with explicit equivalences with the category of bounded lattices and bounded lattice homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Stratifications and term description over valued fields with analytic structure, uniform Yomdin-Gromov parametrizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a certain strong smooth stratification of sets and a term description of functions, which are definable over valued fields (possibly non algebraically closed) with analytic structure. The basic tools are: elimination of valued field quantifiers, term structure of definable functions, Lipschitz cell decomposition with preparation of RV-parametrized sets, and a non-Archimedean definable version of Bierstone-Milman's canonical desingularization algorithm, achieved in an earlier paper of ours. As application, uniform Yomdin-Gromov parametrizations of definable sets are given.</description>

      <title>Measurability in the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to explicitly extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. As the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning underpins a wide range of further theoretical developments, our results are of foundational importance: A careful analysis of measurability aspects is essential, especially when the theorem is used in settings where measure-theoretic subtleties play a role. We particularly discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals. This class of hypothesis spaces covers all artificial neural networks for binary classification that use commonly employed activation functions like ReLU and the sigmoid function.</description>
