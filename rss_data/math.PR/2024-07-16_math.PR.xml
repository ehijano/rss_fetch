      <title>Lipschitz estimates in the Besov settings for Young and rough differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a set of techniques that enable us to effectively recover Besov rough analysis from p-variation rough analysis. Central to our approach are new metric groups, in which some objects in rough path theory that have been previously viewed as two-parameter can be considered as path increments. Furthermore, we develop highly precise Lipschitz estimates for Young and rough differential equations, both in the variation and Besov scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of subweibull distributions has recently been shown to generalize the important properties of subexponential and subgaussian random variables. We describe alternative characterizations of subweibull distributions and detail the conditions under which their tail behavior is preserved after exponential tilting.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $a$-step walks of random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cumulants of $q$-step closed and non-closed walks in the Erd\H os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of the free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in theoretical and mathematical physics. Using a diagram technique, we show that the leading term $F_k^{(q)}$ of the normalized cumulant of $k$-th order can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for closed walks, respectively. Adapting the Pr\"ufer codification procedure to such diagrams, we get explicit expressions for the number of tree-type diagrams of $k$ elements and show that in certain cases, $F_k^{(q)}$ can be bounded from above by the $k$-th moment of the sum of $k(q-1)+1$ independent Bernoulli random variables. These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the numbers of $q$-step walks in random graphs and to show that in the additional limiting transition of infinite $q$, the term $F_k^{(q)}$, considered for large values of $k$, admits an upper bound that asymptotically coincides with that of the $k$-th moment of the Compound Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>Metastability in Glauber dynamics for heavy-tailed spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Glauber dynamics for heavy-tailed spin glasses, in which the couplings are in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$ stable law for $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We show a sharp description of metastability on exponential timescales, in a form that is believed to hold for Glauber/Langevin dynamics for many mean-field spin glass models, but only known rigorously for the Random Energy Models. Namely, we establish a decomposition of the state space into sub-exponentially many wells, and show that the projection of the Glauber dynamics onto which well it resides in, asymptotically behaves like a Markov chain on wells with certain explicit transition rates. In particular, mixing inside wells occurs on much shorter timescales than transit times between wells, and the law of the next well the Glauber dynamics will fall into depends only on which well it currently resides in, not its full configuration. We can deduce consequences like an exact expression for the two-time autocorrelation functions that appear in the activated aging literature.</description>

      <title>When does a Gaussian process have its paths in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate for which Gaussian processes there do or do not exist reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that contain almost all of their paths. Our main result is a negative result that excludes the existence of such RKHS. We then combine this negative result with some known positive results to provide characterizations of the existence of such RKHS for some classical families of Gaussian processes.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the birth-death model of Oncostreams in Glioma, and the effects of Cytochalasin D treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research project investigates the critical role of oncostreams in glioma aggressiveness, leveraging advanced ex-vivo 3D explants and in-vivo intravital imaging techniques to establish a direct correlation between oncostream density and cancer severity. The primary objective is to model the cell populations within oncostreams, with a specific focus on GFP+ NPA cells, to simulate cancer dynamics and provide insights into tumor behavior. The study employs a simple Birth-Death process to analyze cell population dynamics and treatment effects, building and solving Kolmogorov equations to predict changes in cell population over time.
  While the model could be expanded to include additional modulators such as morphological attributes and neurotransmitter exposure, the focus remains on cell population to maintain feasibility. The study also examines various treatment methods, finding that glutamate increases glioma cell movement while histamine reduces it. Collagenase treatment effectively dismantles oncostreams, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy. For this paper, we specifically are going to be looking at Cytochalasin D, which shows promise in disrupting oncostreams and reducing glioma invasiveness. By integrating these treatment variables into the model, the research aims to understand their impact on glioma cell density within the oncostreams and aggressiveness, thereby contributing to improved cancer management strategies. This comprehensive approach is expected to enhance our understanding of glioma progression and inform the development of effective therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimators of cross-partial derivatives and surrogates of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing cross-partial derivatives using fewer model runs is relevant in modeling, such as stochastic approximation, derivative-based ANOVA, exploring complex models, and active subspaces. This paper introduces surrogates of all the cross-partial derivatives of functions by evaluating such functions at $N$ randomized points and using a set of $L$ constraints. Randomized points rely on independent, central, and symmetric variables. The associated estimators, based on $NL$ model runs, reach the optimal rates of convergence (i.e., $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1})$), and the biases of our approximations do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality for a wide class of functions. Such results are used for i) computing the main and upper-bounds of sensitivity indices, and ii) deriving emulators of simulators or surrogates of functions thanks to the derivative-based ANOVA. Simulations are presented to show the accuracy of our emulators and estimators of sensitivity indices. The plug-in estimates of indices using the U-statistics of one sample are numerically much stable.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inverse scattering for the 20-vertex model up to Dynkin automorphism: crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, weak integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a concise proof of the famous Benford's law when the distribution has a Riemann integrable probability density function and provides a criterion to judge whether a distribution obeys the law. The proof is intuitive and elegant, accessible to anyone with basic knowledge of calculus, revealing that the law originates from the basic property of the human number system. The criterion can bring great convenience to the field of fraud detection.</description>

      <title>Exact Label Recovery in Euclidean Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a family of label recovery problems on weighted Euclidean random graphs. The vertices of a graph are embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$ according to a Poisson point process, and are assigned to a discrete community label. Our goal is to infer the vertex labels, given edge weights whose distributions depend on the vertex labels as well as their geometric positions. Our general model provides a geometric extension of popular graph and matrix problems, including submatrix localization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization, and includes the Geometric Stochastic Block Model (proposed by Sankararaman and Baccelli) as a special case. We study the fundamental limits of exact recovery of the vertex labels. Under a mild distinctness of distributions assumption, we determine the information-theoretic threshold for exact label recovery, in terms of a Chernoff-Hellinger divergence criterion. Impossibility of recovery below the threshold is proven by a unified analysis using a Cram\'er lower bound. Achievability above the threshold is proven via an efficient two-phase algorithm, where the first phase computes an almost-exact labeling through a local propagation scheme, while the second phase refines the labels. The information-theoretic threshold is dictated by the performance of the so-called genie estimator, which decodes the label of a single vertex given all the other labels. This shows that our proposed models exhibit the local-to-global amplification phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Stochastic branching models for the telomeres dynamics in a model including telomerase activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides at the end of chromosomes, whose evolution over time is intrinsically related to biological ageing. In most cells, with each cell division, telomeres shorten due to the so-called end replication problem, which can lead to replicative senescence and a variety of age-related diseases. On the other hand, in certain cells, the presence of the enzyme telomerase can lead to the lengthening of telomeres, which may delay or prevent the onset of such diseases but can also increase the risk of cancer.In this article, we propose a stochastic representation of this biological model, which takes into account multiple chromosomes per cell, the effect of telomerase, different cell types and the dependence of the distribution of telomere length on the dynamics of the process. We study theoretical properties of this model, including its long-term behaviour. In addition, we investigate numerically the impact of the model parameters on biologically relevant quantities, such as the Hayflick limit and the Malthusian parameter of the population of cells.</description>

      <title>Testing by Betting while Borrowing and Bargaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing by betting has been a cornerstone of the game-theoretic statistics literature. In this framework, a betting score (or more generally an e-process), as opposed to a traditional p-value, is used to quantify the evidence against a null hypothesis: the higher the betting score, the more money one has made betting against the null, and thus the larger the evidence that the null is false. A key ingredient assumed throughout past works is that one cannot bet more money than one currently has. In this paper, we ask what happens if the bettor is allowed to borrow money after going bankrupt, allowing further financial flexibility in this game of hypothesis testing. We propose various definitions of (adjusted) evidence relative to the wealth borrowed, indebted, and accumulated. We also ask what happens if the bettor can "bargain", in order to obtain odds bettor than specified by the null hypothesis. The adjustment of wealth in order to serve as evidence appeals to the characterization of arbitrage, interest rates, and num\'eraire-adjusted pricing in this setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and probability $p$, we form the random subgraph $G_p$ by retaining each edge of $G$ independently with probability $p$. Given $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and constants $0&lt;c&lt;1, \varepsilon&gt;0$, we show that if every subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ of size exactly $\frac{c|V(G)|}{d}$ satisfies $|N(S)|\ge d|S|$ and $p=\frac{1+\varepsilon}{d}$, then the probability that $G_p$ does not contain a cycle of length $\Omega(\varepsilon^2c^2|V(G)|)$ is exponentially small in $|V(G)|$. As an intermediate step, we also show that given $k,d\in \mathbb{N}$ and a constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, if every subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ of size exactly $k$ satisfies $|N(S)|\ge kd$ and $p=\frac{1+\varepsilon}{d}$, then the probability that $G_p$ does not contain a path of length $\Omega(\varepsilon^2 kd)$ is exponentially small. We further discuss applications of these results to $K_{s,t}$-free graphs of maximal density.</description>

      <title>Sideward contact tracing in an epidemic model with mixing groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic epidemic model with sideward contact tracing. We assume that infection is driven by interactions within mixing events (gatherings of two or more individuals). Once an infective is diagnosed, each individual who was infected at the same event as the diagnosed individual is contact traced with some given probability. Assuming few initial infectives in a large population, the early phase of the epidemic is approximated by a branching process with sibling dependencies. To address the challenges given by the dependencies, we consider sibling groups (individuals who become infected at the same event) as macro-individuals and define a macro-branching process. This allows us to derive an expression for the effective macro-reproduction number which corresponds to the effective individual reproduction number and represents a threshold for the behaviour of the epidemic. Through numerical illustrations, we show how the reproduction number varies with the mean size of mixing events, the rate of diagnosis and the tracing probability.</description>

      <title>IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon: Going Beyond Increasing Hazard Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. In the iid model, a gambler sees values in an online fashion, sampled independently from a given distribution. Upon observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  This model has been studied with infinite, finite and unknown number of values. When the gambler faces a random number of values, the model is said to have random horizon. We consider the model in which the gambler is given a priori knowledge of the horizon's distribution. Alijani et al. (2020) designed a single-threshold algorithms achieving a ratio of $1/2$ when the random horizon has an increasing hazard rate and is independent of the values. We prove that with a single-threshold, a ratio of $1/2$ is actually achievable for several larger classes of horizon distributions, with the largest being known as the $\mathcal{G}$ class in reliability theory. Moreover, we extend this result to its dual, the $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ class (which includes the decreasing hazard rate class), and to low-variance horizons. Finally, we construct the first example of a family of horizons, for which multiple thresholds are necessary to achieve a nonzero ratio. We establish that the Secretary Problem optimal stopping rule provides one such algorithm, paving the way towards the study of the model beyond single-threshold algorithms.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow on control space with rough initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the (sub-Riemannian type) control problem of finding a path going from an initial point $x$ to a target point $y$, by only moving in certain admissible directions. We assume that the corresponding vector fields satisfy the bracket-generating (H\"ormander) condition, so that the classical Chow-Rashevskii theorem guarantees the existence of such a path. One natural way to try to solve this problem is via a gradient flow on control space. However, since the corresponding dynamics may have saddle points, any convergence result must rely on suitable (e.g. random) initialisation. We consider the case when this initialisation is irregular, which is conveniently formulated via Lyons' rough path theory. We show that one advantage of this initialisation is that the saddle points are moved to infinity, while minima remain at a finite distance from the starting point. In the step $2$-nilpotent case, we further manage to prove that the gradient flow converges to a solution, if the initial condition is the path of a Brownian motion (or rougher). The proof is based on combining ideas from Malliavin calculus with {\L}ojasiewicz inequalities. A possible motivation for our study comes from the training of deep Residual Neural Nets, in the regime when the number of trainable parameters per layer is smaller than the dimension of the data vector.</description>

      <title>Optimization under rare events: scaling laws for linear chance-constrained programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of chance-constrained programs in which profit needs to be maximized while enforcing that a given adverse event remains rare. Using techniques from large deviations and extreme-value theory, we show how the optimal value scales as the prescribed bound on the violation probability becomes small and how convex programs emerge in the limit. We also use our results to show that the popular CVaR approximation is asymptotically optimal under light-tail assumptions, but it is sub-optimal in a heavy-tailed setting. Then, we apply point process techniques and random set theory to study the suboptimality gap in the Monte Carlo based scenario approach.</description>

      <title>Variance Norms for Kernelized Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theory for Mahalanobis-type anomaly detection on Banach spaces, using ideas from Cameron-Martin theory applied to non-Gaussian measures. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm of a probability measure, which can be consistently estimated using empirical measures. Our framework generalizes the classical $\mathbb{R}^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings, including the general case of non-injective covariance operator. We prove that the variance norm depends solely on the inner product in a given Hilbert space, and hence that the kernelized Mahalanobis distance can naturally be recovered by working on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.
  Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance for semi-supervised anomaly detection. In an empirical study on 12 real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series anomaly detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels. Moreover, we provide an initial theoretical justification of nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distances by developing concentration inequalities in the finite-dimensional Gaussian case.</description>

Abstract: We give an alternative proof and some extensions of results of Carlier, Figalli and Santambrogio on polynomial upper bounds on the Brenier map between probability measures under various conditions on the densities. The proofs are based on the monotonicity of the map and various concentration inequalities, as already used by Colombo and Fathi to prove quadratic growth for transport maps from the standard Gaussian onto log-concave measures.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Processes: entropy, Gibbs states and the continuous time Ruelle operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Riemmaniann compact manifold $M$, the associated Laplacian $\Delta$ and the corresponding Brownian motion $X_t$, $t\geq 0.$ Given a Lipschitz function $V:M\to\mathbb R$ we consider the operator $\frac{1}{2}\Delta+V$, which acts on differentiable functions $f: M\to\mathbb R$ via the operator
  $$\frac{1}{2} \Delta f(x)+\,V(x)f(x) ,$$ for all $x\in M$.
  Denote by $P_t^V$, $t \geq 0,$ the semigroup acting on functions $f: M\to\mathbb R$ given by $$P_{t}^V (f)(x)\,:=\, \mathbb E_{x} \big[e^{\int_0^{t} V(X_r)\,dr} f(X_t)\big].\,$$
  We will show that this semigroup is a continuous-time version of the discrete-time Ruelle operator.
  Consider the positive differentiable eigenfunction $F: M \to \mathbb{R}$ associated to the main eigenvalue $\lambda$ for the semigroup $P_t^V$, $t \geq 0$. From the function $F$, in a procedure similar to the one used in the case of discrete-time Thermodynamic Formalism, we can associate via a coboundary procedure a certain stationary Markov semigroup. The probability on the Skhorohod space obtained from this new stationary Markov semigroup can be seen as a stationary Gibbs state associated with the potential $V$. We define entropy, pressure, the continuous-time Ruelle operator and we present a variational principle of pressure for such a setting.</description>

      <title>Sufficientness postulates for measure-valued P\'{o}lya urn sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the authors studied the distribution properties of a class of exchangeable processes, called measure-valued P\'{o}lya sequences (MVPS), which arise as the observation process in a generalized urn sampling scheme. Here we present several results in the form of "sufficientness" postulates that characterize their predictive distributions. In particular, we show that exchangeable MVPSs are the unique exchangeable models whose predictive distributions are a mixture of the marginal distribution and the average of a probability kernel evaluated at past observation. When the latter coincides with the empirical measure, we recover a well-known result for the exchangeable model with a Dirichlet process prior. In addition, we provide a "pure" sufficientness postulate for exchangeable MVPSs that does not assume a particular analytic form for the predictive distributions. Two other sufficientness postulates consider the case when the state space is finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make use of an entropic property to establish a convergence theorem (Main Theorem), which reveals that the conditional entropy measures the asymptotic Gaussianity. As an application, we establish the {\it entropic conditional central limit theorem} (CCLT), which is stronger than the classical CCLT. As another application, we show that continuous input under iterated Hadamard transform, almost every distribution of the output conditional on the values of the previous signals will tend to Gaussian, and the conditional distribution is in fact insensitive to the condition. The results enable us to make a theoretic study concerning Hadamard compression, which provides a solid theoretical analysis supporting the simulation results in previous literature. We show also that the conditional Fisher information can be used to measure the asymptotic Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>A stochastic model for immune response with mutations and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two simple stochastic models for a pathogen population in the presence of an immune response, where we assume that the immune system must first get rid of the pathogen type with the lowest fitness in each ancestral lineage of pathogen types present in the host. In the first model, the pathogens reproduce independently at rate $\lambda$ without spatial restrictions. The second model is similar but evolves on a graph. In this case, each pathogen occupies a site and can only place offspring on adjacent empty sites. In both models, when a new pathogen is born, it has the same type as its parent with probability $1-r$. Conversely, with probability $r$, a beneficial mutation occurs, generating a new pathogen type with a higher fitness than its parent's type. We assume that the immune system develops an effective immune response, independently at rate 1, for each pathogen type without ancestral types that are still alive, which simultaneously kills all pathogens of that type. Our main results are a complete characterization of the survival-extinction phase diagram of the first model, and sufficient conditions for survival and extinction of the second model on $\mathbb{Z}^d.$ A comparison with similar models introduced by Schinazi and Schweinsberg (2008), where mutations are not necessarily beneficial and the immune response for each pathogen type occurs independently at rate 1, reveals that the first and second models exhibit more complex and comparable behaviors, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the weak convergence of self-normalized partial sum processes in the Skorokhod M1 topology for sequences of random variables which exhibit clustering of large values of the same sign. We show that for stationary regularly varying sequences with such properties, their corresponding properly centered self-normalized partial sums processes converge to a stable Levy process. The convergence is established in the space of cadlag functions endowed with Skorohod's M1 topology, which is more suitable especially for cases in which the standard J1 topology fails to induce weak convergence of joint stochastic functionals.</description>

Abstract: We explore the asymptotic behavior of the centroids of random polygons constructed from regular polygons with vertices on the unit circle by extending the rays so that their lengths form a random permutation of the first (n) integers. Surprisingly, this question has connections to diverse mathematical contexts, including random matrix theory and discrete Fourier transforms. Through rigorous analysis, we establish that the sequence of the suitably rescaled centroids converges to a circularly-symmetric complex normal distribution with variance (\frac{1}{12}). This result is a manifestation of central limit behavior in a setting involving sums of heavily dependent random variables.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the probability of shadowing of a random finite pseudotrajectory by an exact trajectory for linear skew products. We describe general conditions under which a random pseudotrajectory can be shadowed with polynomial (with respect to its length) precision with high probability. Examples satisfying that general condition are continuous linear skew products over Bernoulli shift, doubling map on a circle, and any Anosov linear map on a torus. The main tool used in the proof is Cramer's large deviation theorem.</description>

Abstract: The Cauchy identities play an important role in the theory of symmetric functions. It is known that Cauchy sums for the $q$-Whittaker and the skew Schur polynomials produce the same factorized expressions modulo a $q$-Pochhammer symbol. We consider the sums with restrictions on the length of the first rows for labels of both polynomials and prove an identity which relates them. The proof is based on techniques from integrable probability: we rewrite the identity in terms of two probability measures: the $q$-Whittaker measure and the periodic Schur measure. The relation follows by comparing their Fredholm determinant formulas.</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds Imply Circuit Lower Bounds: from random 2-SAT to Planted Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that sharp thresholds for Boolean functions directly imply average-case circuit lower bounds. More formally we show that any Boolean function exhibiting a sharp enough threshold at \emph{arbitrary} critical density cannot be computed by Boolean circuits of bounded depth and polynomial size. We also prove a partial converse: if a monotone graph invariant Boolean function does not have a sharp threshold then it can be computed on average by a Boolean circuit of bounded depth and polynomial size.
  Our general result also implies new average-case bounded depth circuit lower bounds in a variety of settings.
  (a) ($k$-cliques) For $k=\Theta(n)$, we prove that any circuit of depth $d$ deciding the presence of a size $k$ clique in a random graph requires exponential-in-$n^{\Theta(1/d)}$ size.
  (b)(random 2-SAT) We prove that any circuit of depth $d$ deciding the satisfiability of a random 2-SAT formula requires exponential-in-$n^{\Theta(1/d)}$ size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bounded depth circuit lower bound for random $k$-SAT for any value of $k \geq 2.$ Our results also provide the first rigorous lower bound in agreement with a conjectured, but debated, "computational hardness" of random $k$-SAT around its satisfiability threshold.
  (c)(Statistical estimation -- planted $k$-clique) Over the recent years, multiple statistical estimation problems have also been proven to exhibit a "statistical" sharp threshold, called the All-or-Nothing (AoN) phenomenon. We show that AoN also implies circuit lower bounds for statistical problems. As a simple corollary of that, we prove that any circuit of depth $d$ that solves to information-theoretic optimality a "dense" variant of the celebrated planted $k$-clique problem requires exponential-in-$n^{\Theta(1/d)}$ size.</description>

      <title>Simulation Model Calibration with Dynamic Stratification and Adaptive Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calibrating simulation models that take large quantities of multi-dimensional data as input is a hard simulation optimization problem. Existing adaptive sampling strategies offer a methodological solution. However, they may not sufficiently reduce the computational cost for estimation and solution algorithm's progress within a limited budget due to extreme noise levels and heteroskedasticity of system responses. We propose integrating stratification with adaptive sampling for the purpose of efficiency in optimization. Stratification can exploit local dependence in the simulation inputs and outputs. Yet, the state-of-the-art does not provide a full capability to adaptively stratify the data as different solution alternatives are evaluated. We devise two procedures for data-driven calibration problems that involve a large dataset with multiple covariates to calibrate models within a fixed overall simulation budget. The first approach dynamically stratifies the input data using binary trees, while the second approach uses closed-form solutions based on linearity assumptions between the objective function and concomitant variables. We find that dynamical adjustment of stratification structure accelerates optimization and reduces run-to-run variability in generated solutions. Our case study for calibrating a wind power simulation model, widely used in the wind industry, using the proposed stratified adaptive sampling, shows better-calibrated parameters under a limited budget.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Online Multiple Testing: A Resource Allocation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially conducting multiple experiments where each experiment corresponds to a hypothesis testing task. At each time point, the experimenter must make an irrevocable decision of whether to reject the null hypothesis (or equivalently claim a discovery) before the next experimental result arrives. The goal is to maximize the number of discoveries while maintaining a low error rate at all time points measured by Local False Discovery Rate (LFDR). We formulate the problem as an online knapsack problem with exogenous random budget replenishment. We start with general arrival distributions and show that a simple policy achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such regret rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over claim discoveries, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget safety buffers. It turns out that a little more safety can greatly enhance efficiency -- small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. From a practical perspective, we extend the policy to the scenario with continuous arrival distributions, time-dependent information structures, as well as unknown $T$. We conduct both synthetic experiments and empirical applications on a time series data from New York City taxi passengers to validate the performance of our proposed policies. Our results emphasize how effective policies should be designed in online resource allocation problems with exogenous budget replenishment.</description>

Abstract: We address the well-posedness of subelliptic Fokker-Planck equations arising from stochastic control problems, as well as the properties of the associated diffusion processes. Here, the main difficulty arises from the possible polynomial growth of the coefficients, which is related to the growth of the family of vector fields generating the first layer of the associated Lie algebra. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the energy solution, and its representation as the transition density of the underlying subelliptic diffusion process. Moreover, we show its Holder continuity in time w.r.t.the Fortet-Mourier distance, where the Holder seminorm depends on the degree of homogeneity of the vector fields. Finally, we provide a probabilistic proof of the Feyman-Kac formula, as a consequence of the uniform boundedness in finite time intervals of all moments.</description>

Abstract: It is believed that the large-scale geometric properties of two-dimensional critical percolation are described by a logarithmic conformal field theory, but it has been challenging to exhibit concrete examples of logarithmic singularities and to find an explanation and a physical interpretation, in terms of lattice observables, for their appearance. We show that certain percolation correlation functions receive independent contributions from a large number of similar connectivity events happening at different scales. Combined with scale invariance, this leads to logarithmic divergences. We study several logarithmic correlation functions for critical percolation in the bulk and in the presence of a boundary, including the four-point function of the density (spin) field. Our analysis confirms previous findings, provides new explicit calculations and explains, in terms of lattice observables, the physical mechanism that leads to the logarithmic singularities we discover. Although we adopt conformal field theory (CFT) terminology to present our results, the core of our analysis relies on probabilistic arguments and recent rigorous results on the scaling limit of critical percolation and does not assume a priori the existence of a percolation CFT. As a consequence, our results provide strong support for the validity of a CFT description of critical percolation and a step in the direction of a mathematically rigorous formulation of a logarithmic CFT of two-dimensional critical percolation.</description>
