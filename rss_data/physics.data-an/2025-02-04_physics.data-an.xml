      <title>Parametric Autoresonance with Time-Delayed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10105v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how a constant time delay influences a parametric autoresonant system. This is a nonlinear system driven by a parametrically chirped force with a negative delay-feedback that maintains adiabatic phase locking with the driving frequency. This phase locking results in a continuous amplitude growth, regardless of parameter changes. Our study reveals a critical threshold for delay strength; above this threshold, autoresonance is sustained, while below it, autoresonance diminishes. We examine the interplay between time delay and autoresonance stability, using multi-scale perturbation methods to derive analytical results, which are corroborated by numerical simulations. Ultimately, the goal is to understand and control autoresonance stability through the time-delay parameters.</description>

      <title>The Best Soules Basis for the Estimation of a Spectral Barycentre Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of this work is a fast algorithm to compute the barycentre of a set of networks based on a Laplacian spectral pseudo-distance. The core engine for the reconstruction of the barycentre is an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases, and returns a basis that yields a sparse approximation of the sample mean adjacency matrix. We prove that when the networks are random realizations of stochastic block models, then our algorithm reconstructs the population mean adjacency matrix. In addition to the theoretical analysis of the estimator of the barycentre network, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator. This work is significant because it opens the door to the design of new spectral-based network synthesis that have theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>High dimensional analysis reveals conservative sharpening and a stochastic edge of stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent empirical and theoretical work has shown that the dynamics of the large eigenvalues of the training loss Hessian have some remarkably robust features across models and datasets in the full batch regime. There is often an early period of progressive sharpening where the large eigenvalues increase, followed by stabilization at a predictable value known as the edge of stability. Previous work showed that in the stochastic setting, the eigenvalues increase more slowly - a phenomenon we call conservative sharpening. We provide a theoretical analysis of a simple high-dimensional model which shows the origin of this slowdown. We also show that there is an alternative stochastic edge of stability which arises at small batch size that is sensitive to the trace of the Neural Tangent Kernel rather than the large Hessian eigenvalues. We conduct an experimental study which highlights the qualitative differences from the full batch phenomenology, and suggests that controlling the stochastic edge of stability can help optimization.</description>

      <title>Dealing with data gaps for TianQin with massive black hole binary signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin might encounter data gaps due to factors like micrometeoroid collisions or hardware failures. Such events will cause discontinuity in the data, presenting challenges to the data analysis for TianQin, especially for massive black hole binary mergers. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) accumulates in a non-linear way, a gap near the merger could lead to a significant loss of SNR. It could introduce bias in the estimate of noise properties, and the results of the parameter estimation. In this work, using simulated TianQin data with injected a massive black hole binary merger, we study the window function method, and for the first time, the inpainting method to cope with the data gap, and an iterative estimate scheme is designed to properly estimate the noise spectrum. We find that both methods can properly estimate noise and signal parameters. The easy-to-implement window function method can already perform well, except that it will sacrifice some SNR due to the adoption of the window. The inpainting method is slower, but it can minimize the impact of the data gap.</description>
