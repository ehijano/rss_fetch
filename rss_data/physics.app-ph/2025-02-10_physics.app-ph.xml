      <title>Be Water, My Antennas: Riding on Radio Wave Fluctuation in Nature for Spatial Multiplexing using Programmable Meta-Fluid Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference and scattering, often deemed undesirable, are inevitable in wireless communications, especially when the current mobile networks and upcoming sixth generation (6G) have turned into ultra-dense networks. Current approaches relying on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) combined with artificial-intelligence-aided (AI) signal processing have drawbacks of being power-hungry and requiring wide bandwidth that raise scalability concerns. In this article, we take a radical approach and utilize the channel fading phenomenon to our advantage. Specifically, we propose a novel meta-fluid antenna architecture, referred to as the `fluid' antenna system (FAS), that can freely surf on radio wave fluctuations, like `fluid' figuratively speaking, with fine resolution in space to opportunistically avoid interference, eliminating the need for expensive signal processing. Our experimental results demonstrate that under rich scattering conditions, the proposed meta-fluidic architecture is able to exploit the natural ups and downs of radio waves in space for spatial multiplexing. These breakthrough results show that scattering can be desirable not harmful and interference can be dodged not suppressed, fundamentally changing our perception of fading and our understanding on how interference should be managed in wireless communications networks.</description>

      <title>Practical implementation of a chiral phononic crystal demonstrator with ultra-low frequency bandgap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of phononic crystals for vibration attenuation and isolation has been widely studied, showing that the attenuation frequency range depends on their mass and stiffness. The concepts of chirality and tacticity have been introduced into classical phononic crystals to enrich the dynamics of the mass elements and thereby achieve lower frequency ranges with high vibration attenuation. Although these concepts have demonstrated their effectiveness on lab-scale crystals, their implementation in industrial applications is still rare. Chiral phononic crystals require a complex geometry that complicates their manufacturing. Existing examples require to be fabricated by 3D printing, making them expensive to build on a large scale for demonstration purposes or in-situ applications. In this study, we redefine a chiral phononic crystal design for translational-rotational coupling in order to enable its manufacturability using exclusively conventional processes. We then investigate the design space of these newly designed phononic crystals, using a simplified unit cell FEM model that minimizes computation time. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the crystal's tunability by modifying the dimensions of the chiral links between the masses. A large crystal with ultra-low frequency range attenuation -- starting at 60~Hz -- is then designed, with the aim to demonstrate the influence of the crystal's tacticity on the vibration isolation by hand sensing. A crystal composed of 2 unit cells is manufactured and its measured transfer function is compared with numerical predictions, thus highlighting the disparities between the behavior of the structure under real-life and ideal excitation conditions.</description>

      <title>Nano-size fragmentation of Tantalum in Copper composite using additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biggest challenge in manufacturing an immiscible system is phase segregation and non-uniformity inside the composite matrix. Additive manufacturing has the potential to overcome these difficulties due to the high cooling rate achieved during the process. Here we have developed immiscible Copper-based composites reinforced with Tantalum, which were fabricated using the powder bed fusion melting (PBF-M) technique. The distinct advantage of utilizing Tantalum in this process resides in its high melting point, allowing it to remain in particle form within the composite and contribute to its mechanical and surface/wear properties. The PBF-M results in the in situ fragmentation of micron-size Tantalum particles into nanoparticle form through a surface roughening process during laser interaction, enhancing its mechanical and wear properties. The microstructural evolution of Cu-Ta composites is explained through multiscale numerical modeling. The enhanced yield strength and the dynamics of the Ta particles were corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. The maximum yield strength is exhibited by Cu-5wt%Ta of 80 MPa. Addition of Ta also have significant improvement in wear properties of composites. The current results can be exploited to develop complex shape, high energy efficient copper-based composites.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of nanosecond pulsed discharge in the form of a fast ionization wave: self-consistent two-dimensional modeling and comparison with experiments under negative and positive polarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanosecond discharges are characterized by a shift in energy branching toward the excitation of electronic levels and dissociation, making them particularly attractive for plasma chemistry. Understanding the spatiotemporal structure of these discharges is especially important. This paper presents a detailed 2D-axisymmetric numerical analysis of a nanosecond discharge propagating in a long tube and in pure nitrogen. The modeling is conducted using a self-consistent plasma fluid solver under the local mean energy approximation (LMEA), including photoionization. The discharge develops at moderate pressures, 1 - 10 Torr, in the form of a fast ionization wave (FIW). Simulations are performed for both negative and positive polarities of the voltage pulse applied to the high-voltage electrode. The computational results are validated against available experimental data, including FIW velocity within the studied pressure range, electron density, longitudinal electric field, and the radial distribution of N2(C) emission on a nanosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Influence of gas flow rate on modes of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in a grid-type surface dielectric barrier discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presented work investigates a surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) operated dry synthetic air as the working gas using a combination of experimental measurements and simulations. The primary objective is to characterize the production and consumption dynamics of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to enhance the understanding of their formation and facilitate control of the discharge for applications. Densities of O3, NO2, and N2O5 are measured under varying gas flow rates, utilizing optical absorption spectroscopy as the diagnostic method. A semi-empirical chemical kinetics model is developed based on a compilation of reactions from previous studies on similar types of discharges. The results reveal two previously known and distinct operating modes, with a mode transition occurring between the modes as the flow rate is varied. The results indicate the dependency of the mode transition on the density of sufficiently vibrationally excited nitrogen molecules, which is represented in the model by an increased vibrational temperature at lower gas flow rates. Furthermore, key reactions responsible for the production and consumption of ozone and nitrogen oxides are identified, providing insight into the importance of macroscopic parameters, such as gas temperatures and different time constants, that influence the nonlinear balance of these reactions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for Small-Angle Scattering Data II: Core-Shell Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-angle scattering (SAS) techniques, which utilize neutrons and X-rays, are employed in various scientific fields, including materials science, biochemistry, and polymer physics. During the analysis of SAS data, model parameters that contain information about the sample are estimated by fitting the observational data to a model of sample. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in analyzing SAS data using a sphere model. However, compared with the sphere model, the core-shell model, which represents functional nanoparticles, offers higher application potential and greater analytical value. Therefore, in this study, we propose an analytical method for the more complex and practical core-shell model based on Bayesian inference. Through numerical experiments, we evaluated the performance of this method under different conditions, including measurement times, number of data points, and differences in scattering length density. As a result, we clarify the conditions under which accurate estimations are possible.</description>

      <title>Spin-NeuroMem: A Low-Power Neuromorphic Associative Memory Design Based on Spintronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biologically-inspired computing models have made significant progress in recent years, but the conventional von Neumann architecture is inefficient for the large-scale matrix operations and massive parallelism required by these models. This paper presents Spin-NeuroMem, a low-power circuit design of Hopfield network for the function of associative memory. Spin-NeuroMem is equipped with energy-efficient spintronic synapses which utilize magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to store weight matrices of multiple associative memories. The proposed synapse design achieves as low as 17.4% power consumption compared to the state-of-the-art synapse designs. Spin-NeuroMem also encompasses a novel voltage converter with a 53.3% reduction in transistor usage for effective Hopfield network computation. In addition, we propose an associative memory simulator for the first time, which achieves a 5Mx speedup with a comparable associative memory effect. By harnessing the potential of spintronic devices, this work paves the way for the development of energy-efficient and scalable neuromorphic computing systems.</description>

      <title>Novel and Simple Method for Broadband Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from -6000 to 0 cm^(-1). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) avoids the pitfalls of optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a fraction of the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>
