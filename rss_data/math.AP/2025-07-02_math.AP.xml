      <title>Weak solutions for coupled reaction-diffusion systems with pattern formation by a stochastic fixed point theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical and biochemical reactions can exhibit surprisingly different behaviours, ranging from multiple steady-state solutions to oscillatory solutions and chaotic behaviours. These types of systems are often modelled by a system of reaction-diffusion equations coupled by a nonlinearity. In the article, we study the existence of stochastically perturbed equations of this type. In particular, we show the existence of a probabilitic weak solution of the following stochastic system \begin{align*} \dot {u} &amp; = r_1\,\Delta u+ a_1\, u + b_1 -c_1\, u\cdot v^q+\sigma_1\, g_1(u)\circ \dot W_1, \\ \dot{v} &amp; = r_2 \,A v + a_2\, v + b_2 +c_2\, u\cdot v^q + \sigma_2\, g_2(v)\circ \dot W_2, \end{align*} where $r_i,b_i,c_i, \sigma_i&gt;0$, $a_i\in\mathbb{R}$, and $g_i$ are linear, $i=1,2$, and the exponent $q\geq 1$. The operator $A=-(-\Delta)^{\aleph/2}$ is a fractional power of the Laplacian, $1&lt;\aleph \le2$. The main result is obtained by a Schauder-Tychonoff type fixed point theorem for the controlled versions of the laws of the respective (infinite dimensional) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck system, from which we infer the existence of a weak solution of the coupled system.</description>

      <title>Existence of wave operators for Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study long time behavior of solution to the two dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in the framework of the final state problem. We construct a small global solution to the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation which scatters to a given free solution. From this result, we have the existence of wave operators for the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. The proof is based on the space-time resonance method developed by Gustafson-Nakanishi-Tsai and Germain-Masmoudi-Shatah etc.</description>

      <title>Physical Space Proof of Bilinear Estimates and Applications to Nonlinear Dispersive Equations (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Zakharov system in two and three spatial dimensions, reproducing the optimal local well-posedness results from Bejenaru-Herr-Holmer-Tataru [2] and Bejenaru-Herr [1]. The main tools are similar to [16], based on a bilinear estimate, which is proved in a physical space approach by a new type of div-curl lemma. The new ingredient of our proof is a Strichartz estimate with mixed spatial integrability.</description>

      <title>Suleimanov-Talanov self-focusing and the hierarchy of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the self-focusing of wave packets from the point of view of the semiclassical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. A type of finite-time collapse/blowup of the solution of the associated dispersionless limit was investigated by Talanov in the 1960s, and recently Suleimanov identified a special solution of the dispersive problem that formally regularizes the blowup and is related to the hierarchy of the Painlev\'e-III equation. In this paper we approximate the Talanov solutions in the full dispersive equation using a semiclassical soliton ensemble, a sequence of exact reflectionless solutions for a corresponding sequence of values of the semiclassical parameter epsilon tending to zero, approximating the Talanov initial data more and more accurately in the limit as epsilon tends to zero. In this setting, we rigorously establish the validity of the dispersive saturation of the Talanov blowup obtained by Suleimanov. We extend the result to the full hierarchy of higher focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, exhibiting new generalizations of the Talanov initial data that produce such dispersively regularized extreme focusing in both mixed and pure flows. We also argue that generic perturbations of the Talanov initial data lead to a different singularity of the dispersionless limit, namely a gradient catastrophe for which the dispersive regularization is instead based on the tritronqu\'ee solution of the Painlev\'e-I equation and the Peregrine breather solution which appears near points in space time corresponding to the poles of the former transcendental function as shown by Bertola and Tovbis.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Incompressible Limit for Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Large Bulk Viscosity Coefficient and Large Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For periodic initial data with the density allowing vacuum, we establish the global existence and exponential decay of weak, strong and classical solutions to the two-dimensional(2D) compressible Navier-Stokes equations when the bulk viscosity coefficient is sufficiently large, without any extra restrictions on initial velocity divergence. Moreover, we demonstrate that when the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity, these solutions converge to solutions to the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. For the incompressible limit of weak solutions, our results hold even without requiring the initial velocity field to be divergence-free. Our results are established by introducing time-layers to avoid imposing restrictions on the initial velocity divergence, along with estimates of $L^\infty$ norm of the effective viscous flux $G$ via a time-partitioning approach based on Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality.</description>

      <title>Infinite concentration and oscillation estimates for supercritical semilinear elliptic equations in discs. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our series of papers, we establish infinite concentration and oscillation estimates for supercritical semilinear elliptic equations in discs. Especially, we extend the previous result by the author (N. arXiv:2404.01634) to the general supercritical case. Our growth condition is related to the one introduced by Dupaign-Farina (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 12: 855--882, 2010) and admits two types of supercritical nonlinearities, the Trudinger-Moser type growth $e^{u^p}$ with $p&gt;2$ and the multiple exponential one $\exp{(\cdots(\exp{(u^m)})\cdots)}$ with $m&gt;0$. In this first part, we carry out the analysis of infinite concentration phenomena on any blow-up solutions. As a result, we classify all the infinite concentration behaviors into two types which in particular shows a new behavior for the multiple exponential case. More precisely, we detect an infinite sequence of concentrating parts on any blow-up solutions via the scaling and pointwise techniques. The precise description of the limit profile, energy, and position of each concentration is given via the Liouville equation with the two types of the energy recurrence formulas. This leads us to observe the two types of supercritical behaviors. The behavior for the latter growth is new and can be understood as the limit case of the former one. Our concentration estimates lead to the analysis of infinite oscillation phenomena, including infinite oscillations of bifurcation diagrams, discussed in the second part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the latter part of our series concerning the infinite concentration and oscillation phenomena on supercritical semilinear elliptic equations in discs. Our supercritical setting admits two types of nonlinearities, the Trudinger-Moser type $e^{u^p}$ with $p&gt;2$ and the multiple exponential one $\exp{(\cdots(\exp{(u^m)}))}$ with $m&gt;0$. In the first part, we accomplished the analysis of infinite concentration phenomena on any blow-up solutions. In this second part, we proceed to the study of infinite oscillation phenomena based on the concentration estimates obtained in the first part. As a result, we provide a precise description of the asymptotic shapes of the graphs of blow-up solutions near the origin. This allows us to show several infinite oscillation behaviors around singular solutions with a suitable asymptotic behavior. In particular, we arrive at a natural sufficient condition for infinite oscillations of bifurcation diagrams which ensure the existence of infinitely many solutions. We successfully apply this condition to certain classes of nonlinearities including the two types mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Global existence for a fractionally damped nonlinear Jordan--Moore--Gibson--Thompson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonlinear acoustics, higher-order-in-time equations arise when taking into account a class of thermal relaxation laws in the modeling of sound wave propagation. In the literature, these families of equations came to be known as Jordan--Moore--Gibson--Thompson (JMGT) models. In this work, we show the global existence of solutions relying only on minimal assumptions on the nonlocal damping kernel. In particular, our result covers the until-now open question of global existence of solutions for the fractionally damped JMGT model with quadratic gradient nonlinearity. The factional damping setting forces us to work with non-integrable kernels, which require a tailored approach in the analysis to control. This approach relies on exploiting the specific nonlinearity structure combined with a weak damping provided by the nonlocality kernel.</description>

      <title>Existence of normalized solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using a discrete Schwarz rearrangement on lattice graphs developed in \cite{DSR}, we study the existence of global minimizers for the following functional $I:H^1\left(\mathbb{Z}^N\right)\to \R$, $$I(u)=\frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb{Z}^N}|\nabla u|^2 \,d\mu-\int_{\mathbb{Z}^N} F(u)\, d\mu,$$ constrained on $S_m:=\left\{u \in H^1\left(\mathbb{Z}^N\right) \mid\|u\|_{\ell^2\left(\mathbb{Z}^N\right)}^2=m\right\}$, where $N \geq 2$, $m&gt;0$ is prescribed, $f \in C(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ satisfying some technical assumptions and $F(t):=\int_0^t f(\tau) \,d\tau$. We prove the following minimization problem $$ \inf_{u \in S_m} I(u) $$
  has an excitation threshold $m^*\in [0,+\infty]$ such that \begin{equation*}
  \inf_{u \in S_m} I(u)&lt;0 \quad \text{if and only if } m&gt;m^*. \end{equation*} Based primarily on $m^* \in (0,+\infty)$ or $m^*=0$, we classify the problem into three different cases: $L^2$-subcritical, $L^2$-critical and $L^2$-supercritical. Moreover, for all three cases, under assumptions that we believe to be nearly optimal, we show that $m^*$ also separates the existence and nonexistence of global minimizers for $I(u)$ constrained on $S_{m}$.</description>

      <title>The Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes: the Feynman propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Feynman propagators for the massive Klein--Gordon equation with asymptotically static perturbations. Building on our previous work on the causal propagators, we employ a framework based on propagation of singularities estimates in Vasy's 3sc-calculus. We combine these estimates to prove global spacetime mapping properties for the Feynman propagator, and to show that it satisfies a microlocal Hadamard condition.
  We show that the Feynman propagator can be realized as the inverse of a mapping between appropriate $L^2$-based Sobolev spaces with additional regularity near the asymptotic sources of the Hamiltonian flow, realized as a family of radial points on a compactified spacetime.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamically Consistent Free Boundary Model for Two-Phase Flows in an Evolving Domain with Moving Contact Lines, Variable Contact Angles and Bulk-Surface Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent model, which describes the time evolution of a two-phase flow in an evolving domain. The movement of the free boundary of the domain is driven by the velocity field of the mixture in the bulk, which is determined by a Navier--Stokes equation. In order to take interactions between bulk and boundary into account, we further consider two materials on the boundary, which may be the same or different materials as those in the bulk. The bulk and the surface materials are represented by respective phase-fields, whose time evolution is described by a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard equation. This approach allows for a transfer of material between bulk and surface as well as variable contact angles between the diffuse interface in the bulk and the boundary of the domain. To provide a more accurate description of the corresponding contact line motion, we include a generalized Navier slip boundary condition on the velocity field. We derive our model from scratch by considering local mass balance and energy dissipation laws. Finally, the derivation is completed via the Langrange multiplier approach. We further show that our model generalizes previous models from the literature, which can be recovered from our system by either dropping the dynamic boundary conditions or assuming a static boundary of the domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is to explain how the existing results on the validity of the NLS approximation can be extended from Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ to the spaces of functions $u = v + w$ where $v \in H_{{per}}^s$ and $w \in H^s(\mathbb{R})$. This allows us to use the Peregrine solution of the NLS equation to find freak or rogue wave dynamics in more complicated systems.</description>

      <title>On the Vanishing Viscosity Limit for Inhomogeneous Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations on Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the vanishing viscosity limit for the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on bounded domains with no-slip boundary condition in two or three space dimensions. We show that, under suitable assumptions on the density, we can establish the convergence in energy space of Leray-Hopf type solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation to a smooth solution of the Euler equations if and only if the energy dissipation vanishes on a boundary layer with thickness proportional to the viscosity. This extends Kato's criterion for homogeneous Navier-Stokes equations to the inhomogeneous case. We use a new relative energy functional in our proof.</description>

      <title>The half-space problem of evaporation and condensation for polyatomic gases and entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the steady Boltzmann equation in one spatial variable for a polyatomic single-component gas in a half-space. Inflow boundary conditions are assumed at the half-space boundary, where particles entering the half-space are distributed as a Maxwellian, an equilibrium distribution characterized by macroscopic parameters of the boundary. At the far end, the gas tends to an equilibrium distribution, which is also Maxwellian. Using conservation laws and an entropy inequality, we derive relations between the macroscopic parameters of the boundary and at infinity required for the existence of solutions. The relations vary depending on the sign of the Mach number at infinity, which dictates whether evaporation or condensation takes place at the interface between the gas and the condensed phase. We explore the obtained relations numerically. This investigation reveals that, although the relations are qualitatively similar for various internal degrees of freedom of the gas, clear quantitative differences exist.</description>

This requires developing an elliptic theory for the conformal Laplacian for rough metrics and establishing existence, regularity and a delicate blow-up analysis for its Green function. Most of the analytical work is carried out in dimensions $n \geq 3$ and for $W^{2,q}$ Riemannian metrics with $q&gt;\tfrac{n}{2}$ and should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sharp remainder of the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e inequality for Baouendi-Grushin vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sharp remainder formula for the Poincar\'e inequality for Baouendi-Grushin vector fields in the setting of $L^{p}$ for complex-valued functions. In special cases, we recover previously known results. Additionally, we provide estimates of the remainder term for $p\geq2$ and $1&lt;p&lt;2\leq n&lt;\infty$. As an application, we obtain a blow-up in finite time and global existence of the positive solutions to the initial-boundary value problem of the doubly nonlinear porous medium equation involving a degenerate nonlinear operator $\Delta_{\gamma,p}$.</description>

Abstract: In this work we prove that if $(u_i,v_i)$, $i=1,2$, are smooth enough solutions of the coupled Schr\"odinger-Korteweg-de Vries system \begin{align*} \left. \begin{array}{rl} i u_t+\partial_x^2 u &amp;\hspace{-2mm}=\beta uv - |u|^2 u,\\ \partial_t v + \partial_x^3 v &amp;\hspace{-2mm}=\gamma \partial_x |u|^2-\frac12\partial_x (v^2) \end{array} \right\} \end{align*} with appropriate decay at infinity such that at two different times $t_0=0$ and $t_1=1$ satisfy that $$u_1(0)-u_2(0),u_1(1)-u_2(1),v_1(0)-v_2(0),v_1(1)-v_2(1)\in H^1(e^{ax^{2}}dx),$$ for $a&gt;0$ big enough, then $u_1=u_2$ and $v_1=v_2$.

      <title>Existence and concentration of nontrivial solutions for quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with indefinite potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{align*} -\Delta u+V(x)u+\frac{k}{2}\Delta(u^2)u=f(u)\quad \text{in}~~\mathbb{R}^N\text{,} \end{align*} where $N\geq 3$, $k&gt;0$, $V\in C(\R)$ is an indefinite potential. Under structural conditions on the potential $V$ and the nonlinearity $f$, we establish the existence of a nontrivial solution through a combination of a local linking argument, Morse theory, and the Moser iteration. Moreover, if $f$ is odd, we obtain an unbounded sequence of nontrivial solutions via the symmetric Mountain Pass Theorem. Additionally, as $k\rightarrow0$, we analyze the concentration behavior of nontrivial solutions.</description>

      <title>Schauder-type estimates and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schauder estimates are among the oldest and most useful tools in the modern theory of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). Their influence may be felt in practically all applications of the theory of elliptic boundary-value problems, that is, in fields such as nonlinear diffusion, potential theory, field theory or differential geometry and its applications. Schauder estimates give H\"older regularity estimates for solutions of elliptic problems with H\"older continuous data; they may be thought of as wide-ranging generalizations of estimates of derivatives of an analytic function in the interior of its domain of analyticity and play a role comparable to that of Cauchy's theory in function theory. They may be viewed as converses to the mean-value theorem: a bound on the solution gives a bound on its derivatives. Schauder theory has strongly contributed to the modern idea that solving a PDE is equivalent to obtaining an a priori bound that is, trying to estimate a solution before any solution has been constructed. The chapter presents the complete proofs of the most commonly used theorems used in actual applications of the estimates.</description>

      <title>Muckenhoupt-weighted $L_q(L_p)$ boundedness for time-space fractional nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the $\phi(\Delta)$-type operator studied by Kim \cite[\emph{Adv.~Math.}]{Kim2}, where $\phi$ is a Bernstein function, we establish weighted $L_{q}(L_{p})$ estimates for solutions to the following fractional evolution equation: $$ \partial_{t}^{\alpha}w(t,x) = \phi(\Delta)w(t,x) + h(t,x), \quad t &gt; 0, \; x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}, $$ where $\partial_{t}^{\alpha}$ denotes the Caputo derivative of $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$. To be specific, for all $1 &lt; p, q &lt; \infty$, we demonstrate that $$ \int_{0}^{\infty} \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} \left| \phi(\Delta)w \right|^{p} \mu_{1}(x) \, dx \right)^{\frac{q}{p}} \mu_{2}(t) \, dt \leq C \int_{0}^{\infty} \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} |h|^{p} \mu_{1}(x) \, dx \right)^{\frac{q}{p}} \mu_{2}(t) \, dt, $$ where $\mu_{1}(x) \in A_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ and $\mu_{2}(t) \in A_{q}(\mathbb{R})$ are \emph{Muckenhoupt} weights.~Our proof relies on harmonic analysis techniques, using fundamental tools including the \emph{Fefferman-Stein} inequality and \emph{Hardy-Littlewood} maximal estimates in weighted $L_q(L_p)$ spaces, and \emph{sharp function} estimates for solution operators. In particular, our results extend the work of Han and Kim (2020, J. Differ. Equ.,269:3515-3550) and complement the work of Dong (2023, Calc. Var. Partial Differ. Equ., 62:96).</description>

      <title>Local H\"older Regularity for Quasilinear Elliptic Equations with Mixed Local-Nonlocal Operators, Variable Exponents, and Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish local boundedness and local H\"older continuity of weak solutions to the following prototype problem:
  $$ -\operatorname{div}\left(|x|^{-2 \beta}|\nabla u|^{\mathbf{q}-2} \nabla u\right)+(-\Delta)_{p(\cdot, \cdot), \beta}^{s(\cdot, \cdot)} u=0 \quad \text { in } \quad \Omega, $$
  where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n, n \geq 2$, is a bounded domain. The nonlocal operator is defined by
  $$ (-\Delta)_{p(\cdot, \cdot), \beta}^{s(\cdot, \cdot)} u(x):=\mathrm{P} . \mathrm{V} . \int_{\Omega} \frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{p(x, y)-2}(u(x)-u(y))}{|x-y|^{n+s(x, y) p(x, y)}} \frac{1}{|x|^\beta|y|^\beta} \mathrm{d} y $$
  Here, $p: \Omega \times \Omega \rightarrow(1, \infty)$ and $s: \Omega \times \Omega \rightarrow(0,1)$ are measurable functions, $\mathbf{q}:=\operatorname{ess}_{\Omega \times \Omega} p$, and $0 \leq \beta&lt;n$. Our approach is analytic and relies on an adaptation of the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory to a mixed local-nonlocal framework with variable exponents and weights.</description>

      <title>Initial boundary value problem for a system derived from Eulerian droplet model for air particle flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the initial boundary value problem for a non-strictly hyperbolic $2\times2$ system of equations in the quarter plane $x&gt;0,t&gt;0$ which is derived from Eulerian droplet model for air particle flow for velocity and volume fraction. We show the existence of weak asymptotic solutions to the initial value problem to the system using a regularisation, by a vanishing viscosity method when the initial velocity is bounded measurable, the initial volume fraction is integrable and the boundary data are bounded measurable. Here we use a generalization of the Hopf-Cole transformation. We also derive an explicit formula for the weak solution when the initial data are functions of bounded variation, the boundary datas are bounded and locally in the class of Lipschitz continuous functions. This construction involves the Hopf-Lax formula for the boundary value problem for the Burgers equation and the product of a bounded variation function with derivative of another bounded variation function using non-conservative Volpert product.</description>

      <title>Martingales and Path-Dependent PDEs via Evolutionary Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a semigroup-theoretic framework for the analytic characterisation of martingales with path-dependent terminal conditions. Our main result establishes that a measurable adapted process of the form \[ V(t) - \int_0^t\Psi(s)\, ds \] is a martingale with respect to an expectation operator $\mathbb{E}$ if and only if a time-shifted version of $V$ is a mild solution of a final value problem involving a path-dependent differential operator that is intrinsically connected to $\mathbb{E}$. We prove existence and uniqueness of strong and mild solutions for such final value problems with measurable terminal conditions using the concept of evolutionary semigroups. To characterise the compensator $\Psi$, we introduce the notion of $\mathbb{E}$-derivative of $V$, which in special cases coincides with Dupire's time derivative. We also compare our findings to path-dependent partial differential equations in terms of Dupire derivatives such as the path-dependent heat equation.</description>

      <title>Sharp conditions for exponential and non-exponential uniform stabilization of the time-dependent damped wave equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is classical that uniform stabilization of solutions to the autonomous damped wave equation is equivalent to every geodesic meeting the positive set of the damping, which is called the geometric control condition. In this paper, it is shown that for time-dependent damping a generalization of the geometric control condition is equivalent to uniform stabilization at an exponential rate. Additionally, upper and lower bounds on non-exponential uniform stabilization rates are computed for damping which do not satisfy this geometric control condition. Decay rates are guaranteed via an observability argument, including a new uniform time-dependent observability inequality. Bounds on decay rates are proved via a Gaussian beam construction.</description>

      <title>Higher-order asymptotic profiles of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the convection-diffusion equation with variable diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00896v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the convection-diffusion equation: \[ \partial_t u - \mathrm{div}\left(a(x)\nabla u\right) = d\cdot\nabla \left(\left\lvert u\right\rvert ^{q-1}u\right),\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^n, \ t&gt;0 \] with an integrable initial data $u_{0}(x)$, where $n\ge1$, $q&gt;1+\frac{1}{n}$ and $d\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Moreover, we take $a(x)=1+b(x)&gt;0$, where $b(x)$ is smooth and decays fast enough at spatial infinity. It is known that the asymptotic profile of the solution to this problem can be given by the heat kernel. Moreover, some higher-order asymptotic expansions of the solution have already been studied. In particular, the structures of the second asymptotic profiles strongly depend on the nonlinear exponent $q$. More precisely, these profiles have different decay orders in each of the following three cases: $1+\frac{1}{n}&lt;q&lt;1+\frac{2}{n}$; $q=1+\frac{2}{n}$; $q&gt;1+\frac{2}{n}$. In this paper, we focus on the critical case $q=1+\frac{2}{n}$. By analyzing the corresponding integral equation in details, we have succeeded to give the more higher-order asymptotic expansion of the solution, which generalizes the previous works.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analyse the small-time reachability properties of a nonlinear parabolic equation, by means of a bilinear control, posed on a torus of arbitrary dimension $d$. Under a saturation hypothesis on the control operators, we show the small-time approximate controllability between states sharing the same sign. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case $d=1$, we combine this property with a local exact controllability result, and prove the small-time exact controllability of any positive states towards the ground state of the evolution operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of solutions for a double nonlinear time-dependent parabolic equation with variable density, not in divergence form with a source or absorption. The problem is formulated as a partial differential equation with a nonlinear term that depends on the solution and time. The main results are the existence of weak solutions in suitable function spaces; regularity and positivity of solutions; asymptotic behavior of solutions as time goes to infinity; comparison principles and maximum principles for solutions. The proofs are based on comparison methods and asymptotic techniques. Some examples and applications are also given to illustrate the features of the problem.</description>

      <title>The formation of a soliton gas condensate for the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We discover configurations of $N$-soliton solutions which exhibit the formation (as $N \to \infty$) of a soliton gas condensate. Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$. We then consider more complex solutions with an extra soliton component, and provide rigorous justification of the predictions of the kinetic theory of solitons in this deterministic setting. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$, and the asymptotic description only included elliptic waves in the long-time asymptotics.</description>

By employing the Fourier splitting method, we establish precise decay rates for dissipative solutions, meaning those whose critical norm vanishes as time approaches infinity.

      <description>arXiv:2503.05686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work the standard kinetic theory assumption of instantaneous collisions is lifted. As a continuation of of a previous paper by Kanzler, Schmeiser, and Tora [KRM, 2024], a model for higher order non-instantaneous alignment collisions is presented and studied in the asymptotic regime of short collision duration. A first order accurate approximative model is derived as a correction to the instantaneous limit. Rigorous results on its well-posedness and on the instantaneous limit are proven. The approximative model is a system of two equations. An equally accurate scalar approximation is suggested.</description>

      <title>Hopf-Oleinik lemma for elliptic equations in double divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish, for the first time, a Zaremba-Hopf-Oleinik type boundary point lemma for uniformly elliptic partial differential equations in double divergence form, also known as stationary Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations. As an application, we derive sharp two-sided estimates for the Green's function associated with second-order elliptic equations in non-divergence form in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains.</description>

      <title>A PDE-Based Image Restoration Method: Mathematical Analysis and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present an image restoration method based on solving an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) of the form \begin{equation*} -\Delta u+\lambda \,G(u)=f, \end{equation*} where $\Delta $ denotes the Laplacian, $G(u)$ is a nonlocal operator (with the Gaussian convolution being a particular example), and $f$ is the degraded image. We detail the derivation of the model, prove the existence and uniqueness of its weak solution via the Lax--Milgram theorem (assuming $% f\in L^{2}(\Omega )$), and describe the discretization scheme using finite differences and a fixed-point iterative method. The complete Python implementation is integrated into the article.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for two-phase matrix-valued harmonic map flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of weak solutions for matrix-valued two-phase harmonic map flows with optimal lifespan, which arises as the limiting system of the matrix-valued Rubinstein-Sternberg-Keller problem studied by ({\em Invent. Math.}, 233(1):1--80, 2023). Our approach employs a modified minimizing movement scheme, discretizing the time domain and constructing approximate solutions by interpolating solutions to the associated functional problem within each small time interval.</description>

      <title>Inviscid incompressible limit for capillary fluids with density dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic limit of the 2D and 3D Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system for barotropic capillary fluids with density dependent viscosities in the low Mach number and vanishing viscosity regime is established. In the relative energy framework, we prove the convergence of weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system to the strong solution of the incompressible Euler system. The convergence is obtained through the use of suitable dispersive estimates for an acoustic system altered by the presence of the Korteweg tensor.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of fluctuations of discretized SHE and KPZ equations in the subcritical weak disorder regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of discretized versions of the stochastic heat equation (SHE) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in spatial dimensions $d\geq 3$ in the weak disorder regime. The discretization is defined using the directed polymer model. Previous research has identified the scaling limit of both equations under a suboptimal moment condition and, in particular, it was established that both converge in law to the same limit. We extend this result by showing that the fluctuations of both equations are close in probability in the subcritical weak disorder regime, indicating that they share the same scaling limit (the existence of which remains open). Our result applies under a moment condition that is expected to hold throughout the interior of the weak disorder phase, which is currently only known under a technical assumption on the environment. We also prove a lower tail concentration of the partition functions.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on the d'Alembertian from general relativity. An invitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey has multiple objectives. First, we motivate and review a new distributional notion of the d'Alembertian from mathematical relativity, more precisely, a nonlinear $p$-version thereof, where $p$ is a nonzero number less than one. This operator comes from natural Lagrangian actions introduced relatively recently. Unlike its classical linear yet hyperbolic counterpart, it is nonlinear yet has elliptic characteristics. Second, we describe recent comparison estimates for the $p$-d'Alembertian of Lorentz distance functions (notably a point or a spacelike hypersurface). Their new contribution implied by prior works on optimal transport through spacetime is a control of the timelike cut locus. Third, we illustrate exact representation formulas for these $p$-d'Alembertians employing methods from convex geometry. Fourth, several applications and open problems are presented.</description>
