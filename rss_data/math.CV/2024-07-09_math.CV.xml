      <title>Homogeneous spaces of entire functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous spaces are de Branges' Hilbert spaces of entire functions with the property that certain weighted rescaling transforms induce isometries of the space into itself. A classical example of a homogeneous space is the Paley-Wiener space of entire functions with exponential type at most a being square integrable on the real axis. Other examples occur in the theory of the Bessel equation. Being homogeneous is a strong property, and one can describe all homogeneous spaces, their structure Hamiltonians, and the measures associated with chains of such spaces, explicitly in terms of powers, logarithms, and confluent hypergeometric functions.
  The theory of homogeneous spaces was in essence settled by L.de Branges in the early 1960's. However, in his work some connections and explicit formulae are not given, some results are stated without a proof, and last but not least a mistake occurs which seemingly remained unnoticed up to the day.
  In this paper we give a detailed account on homogeneous spaces. We provide explicit proofs for all formulae and relations between the mentioned objects, and correct the mentioned mistake.</description>

      <title>Contraction property of Fock type space of log-subharmonic functions in $\mathbb{C}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a contraction property of Fock spaces $\mathcal{F}_{\alpha}^p$ proved by Carlen in \cite{carlen}. To prove the result, we demonstrate a certain monotonic property of measures of the superlevel set of the function $u(x) = |f(x)|^p e^{-\alpha/2 p |x|^2}$, provided that $f$ is a certain log-subharmonic function in $\mathbb{R}^m$. The proof works for the class of all log-subharmonic functions belonging to the Fock-type space.</description>

      <title>Small $x$ asymptotics for special function solutions of Painlev\'e III equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the small $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation. We use the representation of solution in terms of Hankel determinants of Bessel functions, which seems to be new. Hankel determinants can be rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief identity. Finally small $x$ asymptotics is obtained using elementary asymptotic methods.</description>

      <title>Homology Covers of Riemann Surfaces and Automorphisms: Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If either $k \geq 2$ is an integer or $k=\infty$, then associated to a Riemann surface $S$ is its $k$-homoly cover $\widetilde{S}_{k}$. The surface $\widetilde{S}_{k}$ has a group of conformal automorphisms $M_{k} \cong {\rm H}_{1}(S;{\mathbb Z}_{k})$, where ${\mathbb Z}_{\infty}={\mathbb Z}$, such that $S=\widetilde{S}_{k}/M_{k}$. Moreover, for every group $L \leq {\rm Aut}(S)$, there is a short exact sequence $1 \to M_{k} \to \widetilde{L}_{k} \to L \to 1$, where $\widetilde{L}_{k}$ is a subgroup of conformal automorphisms of $\widetilde{S}_{k}$. If $k \neq \infty$ and $S$ is analytically finite and non-exceptional, then $M_{k}$, $\widetilde{L}_{k}$ and $L$ are finite groups. In this case, if $k$ and $|L|$, the order of $L$, are relatively prime integers, then the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem asserts that $\widetilde{L}_{k} \cong M_{k} \rtimes L$. In this paper, we investigate situations when $k$ and $|L|$ are not necesarily relatively primes.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Yang-Mills functionals on direct images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a polarized family of complex projective manifolds, we study the Hermitian Yang-Mills functionals on the sequence of vector bundles over the base of the family associated with direct image sheaves of the tensor powers of the polarization. We make a connection between the asymptotic minimization of these functionals, for big tensor powers of the polarization, and the minimization of the so-called Wess-Zumino-Witten functional defined on the space of all relatively K\"ahler $(1, 1)$-forms on the fibration. We establish the sharp lower bounds on the latter functional in terms of the limiting Harder-Narasimhan measure, which is a certain algebraic invariant of the family. As an application, in a fibered setting, we prove an asymptotic converse to the Andreotti-Grauert theorem conjectured by Demailly.</description>

      <title>Loewner traces driven by Levy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loewner chains with Levy drivers have been proposed in the physics literature as models related to random dendritic growth in off-critical systems (and even for diffusion-limited aggregation), and in mathematics as candidates for finding extremal multifractal spectra (towards Brennan's conjecture and related problems in classical function theory). These processes are not scale-invariant in general, but they do enjoy a natural domain Markov property thanks to the stationary independent increments of Levy processes. The associated Loewner hulls feature remarkably intricate topological properties and possibly complicated multifractal phenomena, of which very little is known rigorously.
  We prove that a chordal Loewner chain driven by a Levy process $W$ satisfying mild regularity conditions (including stable processes) is a.s. generated by a cadlag curve. Specifically, if the diffusivity parameter of the driving process $W$ is $\kappa \in [0,8)$, then the jump measure of $W$ is required to be locally (upper) Ahlfors regular near the origin, while if $\kappa &gt; 8$, no constraints are imposed. In particular, we show that the associated Loewner hulls are a.s. locally connected and path-connected. We also show that, the complements of the hulls are a.s. Holder domains when $\kappa \neq 4$ (which is not expected to hold when $\kappa=4$), without any regularity assumptions. The proofs of these results mainly rely on careful derivative estimates for both the forward and backward Loewner maps obtained using delicate but robust enough supermartingale domination arguments. As one cannot control the jump accumulation of general Levy processes, we must circumvent all reasoning that would use continuity. To prove the local connectedness, we use an extension of part of the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem: hulls generated by cadlag curves are locally connected even when jumps would occur at infinite intensity.</description>

      <title>On a nonhomogeneous heat equation on the complex plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic behaviors of mild solutions of a parabolic evolution equations on complex plane, in which the diffusion operator has the form \(\overline{\Box}_{\varphi} = \overline{D}\, \overline{D}^{\ast}\), where \(\overline{D} f = \bar{\partial}f + \varphi_{\bar{z}} f\), the function \(\varphi\) is smooth and subharmonic on \(\mathbb{C}\), and \(\overline{D}^{\ast}\) is the formal adjoint of \(\overline{D}\). Our method combines certain estimates of heat kernel associating with the homogeneous linear equation of Raich \cite{raich06} and a fixed point argument.</description>
