      <title>Bioinspired Tapered-Spring Turbulence Sensor for Underwater Flow Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a bio-inspired underwater whisker sensor for robust hydrodynamic disturbance detection and efficient signal analysis based on Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC). The design uses a tapered nylon spring with embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\% error, entropy captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and logistic regression achieved 86.0\% classification accuracy with millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in autonomous marine robots.</description>

      <title>In-pixel integration of signal processing and AI/ML based data filtering for particle tracking detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first physical realization of in-pixel signal processing with integrated AI-based data filtering for particle tracking detectors. Building on prior work that demonstrated a physics-motivated edge-AI algorithm suitable for ASIC implementation, this work marks a significant milestone toward intelligent silicon trackers. Our prototype readout chip performs real-time data reduction at the sensor level while meeting stringent requirements on power, area, and latency. The chip is taped-out in 28nm TSMC CMOS bulk process, which has been shown to have sufficient radiation hardness for particle experiments. This development represents a key step toward enabling fully on-detector edge AI, with broad implications for data throughput and discovery potential in high-rate, high-radiation environments such as the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Lithographic integration of TES microcalorimeters with SQUID multiplexer circuits for large format spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of hundreds or thousands of low temperature detectors have been deployed for many experiments, both bolometers for long wavelength applications and calorimeters for shorter wavelength applications. One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.</description>

      <title>Aluminum-Based Superconducting Tunnel Junction Sensors for Nuclear Recoil Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BeEST experiment is searching for sub-MeV sterile neutrinos by measuring nuclear recoil energies from the decay of $^7$Be implanted into superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors. The recoil spectra are affected by interactions between the radioactive implants and the sensor materials. We are therefore developing aluminum-based STJs (Al-STJs) as an alternative to existing tantalum devices (Ta-STJs) to investigate how to separate material effects in the recoil spectrum from potential signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model. Three iterations of Al-STJs were fabricated. The first had electrode thicknesses similar to existing Ta-STJs. They had low responsivity and reduced resolution, but were used successfully to measure $^7$Be nuclear recoil spectra. The second iteration had STJs suspended on thin SiN membranes by backside etching. These devices had low leakage current, but also low yield. The final iteration was not backside etched, and the Al-STJs had thinner electrodes and thinner tunnel barriers to increase signal amplitudes. These devices achieved 2.96 eV FWHM energy resolution at 50 eV using a pulsed 355 nm (~3.5 eV) laser. These results establish Al-STJs as viable detectors for systematic material studies in the BeEST experiment.</description>

      <title>Silicon Wafer Fracture Stress for Tracking Sensors in Particle Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the construction of the ATLAS Inner Tracker strip detector, silicon strip sensor modules are glued directly onto carbon fibre support structures using a soft silicone gel. During tests at temperatures below \unit[-35]{$^{\circ}$C}, several of the sensors were found to crack due to a mismatch in coefficients of thermal expansion between polyimide circuit boards with copper metal layers (glued onto the sensor) and the silicon sensor itself. While module assembly procedures were developed to minimise variations between modules, cold tests showed a wide range of temperatures at which supposedly comparable modules failed. The observed variance (fracture temperatures between \unit[-35]{\textcelsius} and \unit[-70]{\textcelsius}) for supposedly comparable modules suggests an undetected variation between modules suspected to be intrinsic to the silicon wafer itself. Therefore, a test programme was developed to investigate the fracture stress of representative sensor wafer cutoffs. This paper presents results for the fracture stress of silicon sensors used in detector modules.</description>

      <title>Efficient Radiofrequency Sensing with Fluorescence Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically-active spin qubits have emerged as powerful quantum sensors capable of nanoscale magnetometry, yet conventional coherent sensing approaches are ultimately limited by the coherence time of the sensor, typically precluding detection in the sub-MHz regime. We present a broadly applicable fluorescence-encoding method that circumvents coherence-time constraints by transducing time-varying magnetic fields directly into modulated fluorescence signals. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a model system, we demonstrate shot-noise-limited sensitivity for AC magnetic fields spanning near-DC to MHz frequencies, with detection bandwidth tunable via optical excitation power. The technique captures complete spectral information in a single measurement, eliminating the need for point-by-point frequency scanning, and allows phase-sensitive multi-frequency detection with Hz-level resolution. This approach transforms quantum sensors into atomic-scale spectrum analyzers, with immediate applications for low-frequency RF communication, zero-field NMR, and bioelectronic sensing. Our approach is broadly applicable to the expanding class of optically-active spin qubits, including molecular systems and fluorescent proteins, opening new sensing regimes previously inaccessible to coherent techniques</description>

      <title>Constraints on inelastic dark matter from the CDEX-1B experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present limits on spin-independent inelastic WIMP-nucleus scattering using the 737.1 kg $\cdot$ day dataset from the CDEX-1B experiment. Expected nuclear recoil spectra for various inelastic WIMP masses $m_\chi$ and mass splittings $\delta$ are calculated under the standard halo model. An accurate background model of CDEX-1B is constructed by simulating all major background sources. The model parameters are then determined through maximum likelihood estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting. The resulting 90\% confidence level upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{n}}$ exclude certain DAMA/LIBRA allowed regions: the $\chi^2 &lt; 4$ regions for $\delta &lt; 30$ keV at $m_\chi = 250$ GeV and the $\chi^2 &lt; 9$ region for $\delta &lt; 50$ keV at $m_\chi = 500$ GeV. The method is applicable to other inelastic dark matter scenarios, and the upcoming CDEX-50 experiment is expected to improve sensitivity by four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The CMS Phase-2 Fast Beam Condition Monitor prototype test with beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fast Beam Condition Monitor (FBCM) is a standalone luminometer for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) program of the CMS Experiment at CERN. The detector is under development and features a new, radiation-hard, front-end application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for beam monitoring applications. The achieved timing resolution of a few nanoseconds enables the measurement of both the luminosity and the beam-induced background. The ASIC, called FBCM23, features six channels with adjustable shaping times, enabling in-field fine-tuning. Each ASIC channel outputs a single binary asynchronous signal encoding time of arrival and time over threshold information. The FBCM is based on silicon-pad sensors, with two sensor designs presently being considered. This paper presents the results of tests of the FBCM detector prototype using both types of silicon sensors with hadron, muon, and electron beams. Irradiated FBCM23 ASICs and silicon-pad sensors were also tested to simulate the expected conditions near the end of the detector's lifetime in the HL-LHC radiation environment. Based on test results, direct bonding between the sensor and ASIC was chosen, and an optimal bias voltage and ASIC threshold for FBCM operation were proposed. The current design of the front-end test board was validated following the beam test and is now being used for the first front-end module, which is expected to be produced in summer 2025. These results represent a major step forward in validating the FBCM concept, first version of the firmware and establishing a reliable design path for the final detector.</description>

      <title>A 28nm Multiply-Accumulate ASIC Architecture for On-Chip Data Compression in MHz Frame Rate X-ray and Electron Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern X-ray detector systems urgently require compact, efficient, and fast data compression schemes to handle the transmission of big data from pixel arrays, enabling frame rates in the MHz regime. In this work, a data compression ASIC that implements a streaming fixed-length lossy compression scheme is introduced and analyzed, proving the feasibility and benefits of on-chip compression. The compression scheme utilizes a vector matrix product logic, which performs a number of floating-point multiplications, additions, and accumulations. The logic is verified, synthesized, and shown to fit in the area resource available for the X-ray detector under study, which comprises 192 x 168 pixels each of 12-bit width, and having a total area of 20 mm x 20 mm, about 2 mm x 20 mm of which are available for the digital logic. Several system architectures, precisions, and compression ratios ranging from 100 to 250 were analyzed to pave the way for on-chip fixed-length compression (e.g., principal component analysis, singular value decomposition) and data reduction (e.g., azimuthal integration) for X-ray and electron detectors.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based parametrization of the resolution function for the first experimental area (EAR1) of the n_TOF facility at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a challenge of parametrizing a resolution function of the neutron beam from the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN. A difficulty stems from a fact that a resolution function exhibits rather strong variations in shape, over approximately 10 orders of magnitude in neutron energy. In order to avoid a need for a manual identification of the appropriate analytical forms - hindering past attempts at its parametrization - we take advantage of the versatile machine learning techniques. In particular, we parametrize it by training a multilayer feedforward neural network, relying on a key idea that such networks act as the universal approximators. The proof of concept is presented for a resolution function for the first experimental area of the n_TOF facility, from the third phase of its operation. We propose an optimal network structure for a resolution function in question, which is also expected to be optimal or near-optimal for other experimental areas and for different phases of n_TOF operation. In order to reconstruct several resolution function forms in common use from a single parametrized form, we provide a practical tool in the form of a specialized C++ class encapsulating the computationally efficient procedures suited to the task. Specifically, the class allows an application of a user-specified temporal spread of a primary proton beam (from a neutron production process at n_TOF) to a desired resolution function form.</description>

Abstract: The paper demonstrates the design and execution of a low-cost optical spectrometer that employs a webcam, diffraction grating &amp; Python (a free, open-source programming language). The device's design prioritized economy and usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs, as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition, the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in cost-constrained situations.</description>
