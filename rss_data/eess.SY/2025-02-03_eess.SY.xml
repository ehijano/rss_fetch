      <title>Optimizing Bidding Curves for Renewable Energy in Two-Settlement Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordination of day-ahead and real-time electricity markets is imperative for cost-effective electricity supply and also to provide efficient incentives for the energy transition. Although stochastic market designs feature the least-cost coordination, they are incompatible with current deterministic markets. This paper proposes a new approach for compatible coordination in two-settlement markets based on benchmark bidding curves for variable renewable energy. These curves are optimized based on a bilevel optimization problem, anticipating per-scenario responses of deterministic market-clearing problems and ultimately minimizing the expected cost across day-ahead and real-time markets. Although the general bilevel model is challenging to solve, we theoretically prove that a single-segment bidding curve with a zero bidding price is sufficient to achieve system optimality if the marginal cost of variable renewable energy is zero, thus addressing the computational challenge. In practice, variable renewable energy producers can be allowed to bid multi-segment curves with non-zero prices. We test the bilevel framework for both single- and multiple-segment bidding curves under the assumption of fixed bidding prices. We leverage duality theory and McCormick envelopes to derive the linear programming approximation of the bilevel problem, which scales to practical systems such as a 1576-bus NYISO system. We benchmark the proposed coordination and find absolute dominance over the baseline solution, which assumes that renewables agnostically bid their expected forecasts. We also demonstrate that our proposed scheme provides a good approximation of the least-cost, yet unattainable in practice, stochastic market outcome.</description>

      <title>One Stack, Diverse Vehicles: Checking Safe Portability of Automated Driving Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating an automated driving software stack into vehicles with variable configuration is challenging, especially due to different hardware characteristics. Further, to provide software updates to a vehicle fleet in the field, the functional safety of every affected configuration has to be ensured. These additional demands for dependability and the increasing hardware diversity in automated driving make rigorous automatic analysis essential. This paper addresses this challenge by using formal portability checking of adaptive cruise controller code for different vehicle configurations. Given a formal specification of the safe behavior, models of target configurations are derived, which capture relevant effects of sensors, actuators and computing platforms. A corresponding safe set is obtained and used to check if the desired behavior is achievable on all targets. In a case study, portability checking of a traditional and a neural network controller are performed automatically within minutes for each vehicle hardware configuration. The check provides feedback for necessary adaptations of the controllers, thus, allowing rapid integration and testing of software or parameter changes.</description>

      <title>Tracking Error Based Fault Tolerant Scheme for Marine Vehicles with Thruster Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an active model-based fault and failure tolerant control scheme for a class of marine vehicles with thruster redundancy. Unlike widely used state and parameter estimation methods, where the estimation errors are utilized to generate residual, in this paper we directly apply the trajectory tracking error terms to construct residual and detect thruster fault and failure in the steady state of the tracking system. As for identification or diagnosis, this paper proposes a novel scheme through a detailed examination of the tracking error trends and the combinations of thruster configurations. Since this fault detection and identification operates within the same closed-loop of the tracking control system, control reconfiguration can be easily achieved by adjusting the weight parameter of the isolated thruster to minimize tracking errors or residual. Numerical studies with the real world vehicle model is also carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Subspace Identification for Stochastic Systems Using Multiple Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18853v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the analysis of identification errors for $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems with $m$ outputs and no external inputs, using Subspace Identification Methods (SIM) with finite sample data. We provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$, and the closed loop matrix $A-KC $, based on multiple sample trajectories, and further give the first non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system poles, which cover both (marginally) stable systems and unstable systems. We show that, with high probability, the non-asymptotic estimation errors of these matrices decay at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{\frac{1}{2n}}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned when the ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of the system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIM.</description>

      <title>Scalable Distributed Reproduction Numbers of Network Epidemics with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproduction numbers are widely used for the estimation and prediction of epidemic spreading processes over networks. However, conventional reproduction numbers of an overall network do not indicate where an epidemic is spreading. Therefore, we propose a novel notion of local distributed reproduction numbers to capture the spreading behaviors of each node in a network. We first show how to compute them and then use them to derive new conditions under which an outbreak can occur. These conditions are then used to derive new conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibrium states of the underlying epidemic model. Building upon these local distributed reproduction numbers, we define cluster distributed reproduction numbers to model the spread between clusters composed of nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the local distributed reproduction numbers can be aggregated into cluster distributed reproduction numbers at different scales. However, both local and cluster distributed reproduction numbers can reveal the frequency of interactions between nodes in a network, which raises privacy concerns. Thus, we next develop a privacy framework that implements a differential privacy mechanism to provably protect the frequency of interactions between nodes when computing distributed reproduction numbers. Numerical experiments show that, even under differential privacy, the distributed reproduction numbers provide accurate estimates of the epidemic spread while also providing more insights than conventional reproduction numbers.</description>

      <title>Fully Distributed and Quantized Algorithm for MPC-based Autonomous Vehicle Platooning Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems have recently emerged to address the growing interest for safer, more efficient, and sustainable transportation solutions. In this direction, this paper presents distributed algorithms for control and optimization over vehicular networks. First, we formulate the autonomous vehicle platooning framework based on model-predictive-control (MPC) strategies and present its objective optimization as a cooperative quadratic cost function. Then, we propose a distributed algorithm to locally optimize this objective at every vehicle subject to data quantization over the communication network of vehicles. In contrast to most existing literature that assumes ideal communication channels, log-scale data quantization over the network is addressed in this work, which is more realistic and practical. In particular, we show by simulation that the proposed log-quantized algorithm reaches optimal convergence with less residual and optimality gap. This outperforms the existing literature considering uniform quantization which leads to a large optimality gap and residual.</description>

      <title>Distributed Observer Design for Tracking Platoon of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) aim to advance innovative strategies relating to different modes of transport, traffic management, and autonomous vehicles. This paper studies the platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) and proposes a distributed observer to track the state of the CAV dynamics. First, we model the CAV dynamics via an LTI interconnected system. Then, a consensus-based strategy is proposed to infer the state of the CAV dynamics based on local information exchange over the communication network of vehicles. A linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) technique is adopted for the block-diagonal observer gain design such that this gain is associated in a distributed way and locally to every vehicle. The distributed observer error dynamics is then shown to follow the structure of the Kronecker matrix product of the system dynamics and the adjacency matrix of the CAV network. The notions of survivable network design and redundant observer scheme are further discussed in the paper to address resilience to link and node failure. Finally, we verify our theoretical contributions via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Controllable Neural Architectures for Multi-Task Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a multi-task control problem where multiple linear systems are to be regulated by a single non-linear controller. In particular, motivated by recent advances in multi-task learning and the design of brain-inspired architectures, we consider a neural controller with (smooth) ReLU activation function. The parameters of the controller are a connectivity matrix and a bias vector: although both parameters can be designed, the connectivity matrix is constant while the bias vector can be varied and is used to adapt the controller across different control tasks. The bias vector determines the equilibrium of the neural controller and, consequently, of its linearized dynamics. Our multi-task control strategy consists of designing the connectivity matrix and a set of bias vectors in a way that the linearized dynamics of the neural controller for the different bias vectors provide a good approximation of a set of desired controllers. We show that, by properly choosing the bias vector, the linearized dynamics of the neural controller can replicate the dynamics of any single, linear controller. Further, we design gradient-based algorithms to train the parameters of the neural controller, and we provide upper and lower bounds for the performance of our neural controller. Finally, we validate our results using different numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A parallelizable variant of HCA*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a parallelizable variant of the well-known Hierarchical Cooperative A* algorithm (HCA*) for the multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem. In this variant, all agents initially find their shortest paths disregarding the presence of others. This is done using A*. Then an intersection graph (IG) is constructed; each agent is a node and two nodes have an edge between them if the paths of corresponding agents collide. Thereafter, an independent set is extracted with the aid of an approximation algorithm for the maximum independent set problem. The paths for the agents belonging to independent set are fixed. The rest of agents now again find their shortest paths, this time ensuring no collision with the prior agents. Space-time A*, which is a crucial component of HCA*, is used here. These iterations continue until no agents are left. Since the tasks of finding shortest paths for the agents in any iteration are independent of each other, the proposed algorithm can be parallelized to a large extent. In addition to this, the task of determining the IG can also be done in parallel by dividing the map into sections and with each agent focusing on a particular section. The parallelism does come at a cost of communication between the agents and the server. This is accounted for in the simulations. As an added advantage, the user need not make a choice for the priority order. It is observed, empirically, that the proposed algorithm outperforms HCA* in terms of the computation time and the cost value in many cases. Simulations are provided for corroboration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hierarchical framework for decision-making and optimization, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for adaptive code generation. Instead of direct decision-making, LLMs generate and refine executable control policies through a meta-policy that guides task generation and a base policy for operational actions. Applied to a simplified microgrid scenario, the approach achieves up to 15 percent cost savings by iteratively improving battery control strategies. The proposed methodology lays a foundation for integrating LLM-based tools into planning and control tasks, offering adaptable and scalable solutions for complex systems while addressing challenges of uncertainty and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Distributed Offloading in Multi-Access Edge Computing Systems: A Mean-Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology is a promising solution to assist power-constrained IoT devices by providing additional computing resources for time-sensitive tasks. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal task offloading in MEC systems with due consideration of the timeliness and scalability issues under two scenarios of equitable and priority access to the edge server (ES). In the first scenario, we consider a MEC system consisting of $N$ devices assisted by one ES, where the devices can split task execution between a local processor and the ES, with equitable access to the ES. In the second scenario, we consider a MEC system consisting of one primary user, $N$ secondary users and one ES. The primary user has priority access to the ES while the secondary users have equitable access to the ES amongst themselves. In both scenarios, due to the power consumption associated with utilizing the local resource and task offloading, the devices must optimize their actions. Additionally, since the ES is a shared resource, other users' offloading activity serves to increase latency incurred by each user. We thus model both scenarios using a non-cooperative game framework. However, the presence of a large number of users makes it nearly impossible to compute the equilibrium offloading policies for each user, which would require a significant information exchange overhead between users. Thus, to alleviate such scalability issues, we invoke the paradigm of mean-field games to compute approximate Nash equilibrium policies for each user using their local information, and further study the trade-offs between increasing information freshness and reducing power consumption for each user. Using numerical evaluations, we show that our approach can recover the offloading trends displayed under centralized solutions, and provide additional insights into the results obtained.</description>

      <title>STaleX: A Spatiotemporal-Aware Adaptive Auto-scaling Framework for Microservices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While cloud environments and auto-scaling solutions have been widely applied to traditional monolithic applications, they face significant limitations when it comes to microservices-based architectures. Microservices introduce additional challenges due to their dynamic and spatiotemporal characteristics, which require more efficient and specialized auto-scaling strategies. Centralized auto-scaling for the entire microservice application is insufficient, as each service within a chain has distinct specifications and performance requirements. Therefore, each service requires its own dedicated auto-scaler to address its unique scaling needs effectively, while also considering the dependencies with other services in the chain and the overall application. This paper presents a combination of control theory, machine learning, and heuristics to address these challenges. We propose an adaptive auto-scaling framework, STaleX, for microservices that integrates spatiotemporal features, enabling real-time resource adjustments to minimize SLO violations. STaleX employs a set of weighted Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for each service, where weights are dynamically adjusted based on a supervisory unit that integrates spatiotemporal features. This supervisory unit continuously monitors and adjusts both the weights and the resources allocated to each service. Our framework accounts for spatial features, including service specifications and dependencies among services, as well as temporal variations in workload, ensuring that resource allocation is continuously optimized. Through experiments on a microservice-based demo application deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving performance and reducing costs compared to traditional scaling methods like Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with a 26.9% reduction in resource usage.</description>

      <title>A General-Purpose Neuromorphic Sensor based on Spiketrum Algorithm: Hardware Details and Real-life Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired computational paradigm, enabling energy-efficient data processing through spike-based information transmission. Despite notable advancements in hardware for SNNs, spike encoding has largely remained software-dependent, limiting efficiency. This paper addresses the need for adaptable and resource-efficient spike encoding hardware by presenting an area-optimized hardware implementation of the Spiketrum algorithm, which encodes time-varying analogue signals into spatiotemporal spike patterns. Unlike earlier performance-optimized designs, which prioritize speed, our approach focuses on reducing hardware footprint, achieving a 52% reduction in Block RAMs (BRAMs), 31% fewer Digital Signal Processing (DSP) slices, and a 6% decrease in Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The proposed implementation has been verified on an FPGA and successfully integrated into an IC using TSMC180 technology. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in real-world applications, including sound and ECG classification. This work highlights the trade-offs between performance and resource efficiency, offering a flexible, scalable solution for neuromorphic systems in power-sensitive applications like cochlear implants and neural devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a neural network-based approach for time-series prediction in unknown Hamiltonian dynamical systems. Our approach leverages a surrogate model and learns the system dynamics using generalized coordinates (positions) and their conjugate momenta while preserving a constant Hamiltonian. To further enhance long-term prediction accuracy, we introduce an Autoregressive Hamiltonian Neural Network, which incorporates autoregressive prediction errors into the training objective. Additionally, we employ Bayesian data assimilation to refine predictions in real-time using online measurement data. Numerical experiments on a spring-mass system and highly elliptic orbits under gravitational perturbations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its potential for accurate and robust long-term predictions.</description>

      <title>APEX: Automated Parameter Exploration for Low-Power Wireless Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Careful parametrization of networking protocols is crucial to maximize the performance of low-power wireless systems and ensure that stringent application requirements can be met. This is a non-trivial task involving thorough characterization on testbeds and requiring expert knowledge. Unfortunately, the community still lacks a tool to facilitate parameter exploration while minimizing the necessary experimentation time on testbeds. Such a tool would be invaluable, as exhaustive parameter searches can be time-prohibitive or unfeasible given the limited availability of testbeds, whereas non-exhaustive unguided searches rarely deliver satisfactory results. In this paper, we present APEX, a framework enabling an automated and informed parameter exploration for low-power wireless protocols and allowing to converge to an optimal parameter set within a limited number of testbed trials. We design APEX using Gaussian processes to effectively handle noisy experimental data and estimate the optimality of a certain parameter combination. After developing a prototype of APEX, we demonstrate its effectiveness by parametrizing two IEEE 802.15.4 protocols for a wide range of application requirements. Our results show that APEX can return the best parameter set with up to 10.6x, 4.5x and 3.25x less testbed trials than traditional solutions based on exhaustive search, greedy approaches, and reinforcement learning, respectively.</description>

      <title>Neuro-LIFT: A Neuromorphic, LLM-based Interactive Framework for Autonomous Drone FlighT at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.</description>

      <title>From a Frequency-Domain Willems' Lemma to Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Willems' fundamental lemma has recently received an impressive amount of attention from the (data-driven) control community. In this paper, we formulate a version of this celebrated result based on frequency-domain data. In doing so, we bridge the gap between recent developments in data-driven analysis and control, and the readily-available techniques and extensive expertise for non-parametric frequency-domain identification in academia and industry. In addition, we generalize our results to allow multiple frequency-domain data sets to be carefully combined to form a sufficiently rich data set. Building on these results, we propose a data-driven predictive control scheme based on measured frequency-domain data of the plant. This novel scheme provides a frequency-domain counterpart of the well-known data-enabled predictive control scheme DeePC based on time-domain data. We prove that, under appropriate conditions, the new frequency-domain data-driven predictive control (FreePC) scheme is equivalent to the corresponding DeePC scheme, and we demonstrate the benefits of FreePC and the use of frequency-domain data in a numerical case study. These benefits include the ability to collect data in closed loop with a pre-stabilizing controller, dealing with noisy data, without increasing computational complexity, and intuitively visualizing the uncertainty in the frequency-domain data. In addition, we further showcase the potential of our frequency-domain Willems' fundamental lemma in applications to data-driven simulation, and the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problem. Finally, we show that our results can be used to evaluate the transfer function of the system at a desired frequency based on a finite amount of frequency-domain data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking under Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and quantization. The players can only exchange information with their own direct neighbors. The transmitted information is subject to quantization and packet losses induced by malicious DoS attacks. We propose a quantized distributed NE seeking strategy based on the approach of dynamic quantized consensus. To solve the quantizer saturation problem caused by DoS attacks, the quantization mechanism is equipped to have zooming-in and holding capabilities, in which the holding capability is consistent with the results in quantized consensus under DoS. A sufficient condition on the number of quantizer levels is provided, under which the quantizers are free from saturation under DoS attacks. The proposed distributed quantized NE seeking strategy is shown to have the so-called maximum resilience to DoS attacks. Namely, if the bound characterizing the maximum resilience is violated, an attacker can deny all the transmissions and hence distributed NE seeking is impossible.</description>

      <title>Robust Control Barrier Functions using Uncertainty Estimation with Application to Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a safety-critical control design approach for nonlinear control affine systems in the presence of matched and unmatched uncertainties. Our constructive framework couples control barrier function (CBF) theory with a new uncertainty estimator to ensure robust safety. We use the estimated uncertainty, along with a derived upper bound on the estimation error, for synthesizing CBFs and safety-critical controllers via a quadratic program-based feedback control law that rigorously ensures robust safety while improving disturbance rejection performance. We extend the method to higher-order CBFs (HOCBFs) to achieve safety under unmatched uncertainty, which may cause relative degree differences with respect to control input and disturbances. We assume the relative degree difference is at most one, resulting in a second-order cone constraint. We demonstrate the proposed robust HOCBF method through a simulation of an uncertain elastic actuator control problem and experimentally validate the efficacy of our robust CBF framework on a tracked robot with slope-induced matched and unmatched perturbations.</description>

      <title>Quality-Aware Hydraulic Control in Drinking Water Networks via Controllability Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12214v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of water distribution networks is a complex procedure aimed at efficiently delivering consumers with adequate water quantity (WQ) while ensuring its safe quality. An added challenge is the dependency of the WQ dynamics on the system's hydraulics, which influences the performance of the WQ controller. Prior research has addressed either solving the optimum operational hydraulic setting problem or regulating the WQ dynamics as separate problems. Additionally, there have been efforts to couple these two problems and solve one compact problem resulting in trade-offs between the contradictory objectives. In contrast, this paper takes a novel approach by examining the WQ dependency on the hydraulics from a control-theoretic standpoint. More specifically, we explore the influence of accountability for WQ controllability improvement when addressing the pump scheduling problem. We examine its effects on the cumulative cost of the interconnected systems as well as the subsequent performance of the WQ controller. To achieve this, we develop a framework that incorporates different controllability metrics within the operational hydraulic optimization problem; its aim is attaining an adequate level of WQ control across the system. We assess the aforementioned aspects' performance on various scaled networks with a wide range of numerical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic nonlinear systems with contextual uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Validating and controlling safety-critical systems in uncertain environments necessitates probabilistic reachable sets of future state evolutions. The existing methods of computing probabilistic reachable sets normally assume that stochastic uncertainties are independent of system states, inputs, and other environment variables. However, this assumption falls short in many real-world applications, where the probability distribution governing uncertainties depends on these variables, referred to as contextual uncertainties. This paper addresses the challenge of computing probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic nonlinear states with contextual uncertainties by seeking minimum-volume polynomial sublevel sets with contextual chance constraints. The formulated problem cannot be solved by the existing sample-based approximation method since the existing methods do not consider conditional probability densities. To address this, we propose a consistent sample approximation of the original problem by leveraging conditional density estimation and resampling. The obtained approximate problem is a tractable optimization problem. Additionally, we prove the proposed sample-based approximation's almost uniform convergence, showing that it gives the optimal solution almost consistently with the original ones. Through a numerical example, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing approaches, highlighting its capability to significantly reduce the bias inherent in sample-based approximation without considering a conditional probability density.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the Electric Grid through Trustable IoT-Coordinated Assets (Extended version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14861v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</description>

      <title>Unmanned F/A-18 Aircraft Landing Control on Aircraft Carrier in Adverse Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carrier landing of aircrafts is a challenge for control due to the existence of nonlinear wind disturbances and the requirements of changing reference trajectories. In this paper, a robust landing control system is presented for carrier landing of unmanned F/A-18 aircraft. In the control system, an augmented observer is applied to estimate the combined disturbances in the pitch dynamics of F/A-18 aircraft during carrier landing. Therefore, the control performance is improved through the control compensations from these estimations. Additionally, the controllers are designed to regulate the velocity, rate of descent and vertical position. A full model, including the nonlinear flight dynamics, controller, carrier deck motion, wind and measurement noise, is constructed numerically and implemented in software. Combining the observer with a proportional-derivative (PD) control, the proposed pitch control shows the better transient characteristics and stronger robustness than a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The simulations verify that the designed control system can make the aircraft quickly track a time-varying reference despite the existence of nonlinear disturbances and noise.</description>

      <title>Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Submodular Optimization in Robot Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a communication- and computation-efficient method for distributed submodular optimization in robot mesh networks. Submodularity is a property of diminishing returns that arises in active information gathering such as mapping, surveillance, and target tracking. Our method, Resource-Aware distributed Greedy (RAG), introduces a new distributed optimization paradigm that enables scalable and near-optimal action coordination. To this end, RAG requires each robot to make decisions based only on information received from and about their neighbors. In contrast, the current paradigms allow the relay of information about all robots across the network. As a result, RAG's decision-time scales linearly with the network size, while state-of-the-art near-optimal submodular optimization algorithms scale cubically. We also characterize how the designed mesh-network topology affects RAG's approximation performance. Our analysis implies that sparser networks favor scalability without proportionally compromising approximation performance: while RAG's decision time scales linearly with network size, the gain in approximation performance scales sublinearly. We demonstrate RAG's performance in simulated scenarios of area detection with up to 45 robots, simulating realistic robot-to-robot (r2r) communication speeds such as the 0.25 Mbps speed of the Digi XBee 3 Zigbee 3.0. In the simulations, RAG enables real-time planning, up to three orders of magnitude faster than competitive near-optimal algorithms, while also achieving superior mean coverage performance. To enable the simulations, we extend the high-fidelity and photo-realistic simulator AirSim by integrating a scalable collaborative autonomy pipeline to tens of robots and simulating r2r communication delays. Our code is available at https://github.com/UM-iRaL/Resource-Aware-Coordination-AirSim.</description>

      <title>EnergyDiff: Universal Time-Series Energy Data Generation using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. Additionally, EnergyDiff consistently generates highquality time series data across diverse energy domains, time resolutions, and at both customer and transformer levels with reduced computational need.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a malfunction causes a control system to lose authority over a subset of its actuators, achieving a task may require spending additional energy in order to compensate for the effect of uncontrolled inputs. To understand this increase in energy, we introduce energetic resilience metrics that quantify the maximal additional energy required to achieve finite-time regulation in linear driftless systems that lose authority over some of their actuators. We first derive optimal control signals and minimum energies to achieve this task in both the nominal and malfunctioning systems. We then obtain a bound on the worst-case energy used by the malfunctioning system, and its exact expression in the special case of loss of authority over one actuator. Further considering this special case, we derive bounds on additive and multiplicative metrics for energetic resilience. A simulation example on a model of an underwater robot demonstrates that these bounds are useful in quantifying the increased energy used by a system suffering a partial loss of control authority.</description>

      <title>The Smart Buildings Control Suite: A Diverse Open Source Benchmark to Evaluate and Scale HVAC Control Policies for Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commercial buildings account for 17% of U.S. carbon emissions, with roughly half of that from Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC). HVAC devices form a complex thermodynamic system, and while Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning have been used to optimize control policies, scaling to thousands of buildings remains a significant unsolved challenge. Most current algorithms are over-optimized for specific buildings and rely on proprietary data or hard-to-configure simulations. We present the Smart Buildings Control Suite, the first open source interactive HVAC control benchmark with a focus on solutions that scale. It consists of 3 components: real-world telemetric data extracted from 11 buildings over 6 years, a lightweight data-driven simulator for each building, and a modular Physically Informed Neural Network (PINN) building model as a simulator alternative. The buildings span a variety of climates, management systems, and sizes, and both the simulator and PINN easily scale to new buildings, ensuring solutions using this benchmark are robust to these factors and only reliant on fully scalable building models. This represents a major step towards scaling HVAC optimization from the lab to buildings everywhere. To facilitate use, our benchmark is compatible with the Gym standard, and our data is part of TensorFlow Datasets.</description>

Abstract: The development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to the widespread adoption of monitoring networks for a wide variety of applications, such as smart cities, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. A major research focus in recent years has been the development of graph-based techniques to improve the quality of data from sensor networks, a key aspect for the use of sensed data in decision-making processes, digital twins, and other applications. Emphasis has been placed on the development of machine learning and signal processing techniques over graphs, taking advantage of the benefits provided by the use of structured data through a graph topology. Many technologies such as the graph signal processing (GSP) or the successful graph neural networks (GNNs) have been used for data quality enhancement tasks. In this survey, we focus on graph-based models for data quality control in monitoring sensor networks. Furthermore, we delve into the technical details that are commonly leveraged for providing powerful graph-based solutions for data quality tasks in sensor networks, including missing value imputation, outlier detection, or virtual sensing. To conclude, we have identified future trends and challenges such as graph-based models for digital twins or model transferability and generalization.</description>

      <title>Layer-Adaptive State Pruning for Deep State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the lack of state dimension optimization methods, deep state space models (SSMs) have sacrificed model capacity, training search space, or stability to alleviate computational costs caused by high state dimensions. In this work, we provide a structured pruning method for SSMs, Layer-Adaptive STate pruning (LAST), which reduces the state dimension of each layer in minimizing model-level output energy loss by extending modal truncation for a single system. LAST scores are evaluated using the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norms of subsystems and layer-wise energy normalization. The scores serve as global pruning criteria, enabling cross-layer comparison of states and layer-adaptive pruning. Across various sequence benchmarks, LAST optimizes previous SSMs, revealing the redundancy and compressibility of their state spaces. Notably, we demonstrate that, on average, pruning 33% of states still maintains performance with 0.52% accuracy loss in multi-input multi-output SSMs without retraining. Code is available at https://github.com/msgwak/LAST.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted MEC Architecture for Collaborative Task Offloading in Urban IoT Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to meet the increasing demands and computing limitations of complex Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, implementing MEC in urban environments can be challenging due to factors like high device density, complex infrastructure, and limited network coverage. Network congestion and connectivity issues can adversely affect user satisfaction. Hence, in this article, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted collaborative MEC architecture to facilitate task offloading of IoT devices in urban environments. We utilize the combined capabilities of UAVs and ground edge servers (ESs) to maximize user satisfaction and thereby also maximize the service provider's (SP) profit. We design IoT task-offloading as joint IoT-UAV-ES association and UAV-network topology optimization problem. Due to NP-hard nature, we break the problem into two subproblems: offload strategy optimization and UAV topology optimization. We develop a Three-sided Matching with Size and Cyclic preference (TMSC) based task offloading algorithm to find stable association between IoTs, UAVs, and ESs to achieve system objective. We also propose a K-means based iterative algorithm to decide the minimum number of UAVs and their positions to provide offloading services to maximum IoTs in the system. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed task offloading scheme over benchmark schemes through simulation-based evaluation. The proposed scheme outperforms by 19%, 12%, and 25% on average in terms of percentage of served IoTs, average user satisfaction, and SP profit, respectively, with 25% lesser UAVs, making it an effective solution to support IoT task requirements in urban environments using UAV-assisted MEC architecture.</description>
