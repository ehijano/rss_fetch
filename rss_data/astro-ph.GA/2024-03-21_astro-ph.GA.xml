      <title>PHANGS-HST: Globular Cluster Systems in 17 Nearby Spiral Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new catalogs of likely globular clusters (GCs) in 17 nearby spiral galaxies studied as part of the PHANGS-HST Treasury Survey. The galaxies were imaged in five broad-band filters from the near-ultraviolet through the $I$ band. PHANGS-HST has produced catalogs of stellar clusters of all ages by selecting extended sources (from multiple concentration index measurements) followed by morphological classification (centrally concentrated and symmetric or asymmetric, multiple peaks, contaminant) by visually examining the V-band image and separately by a machine-learning algorithm which classified larger samples to reach fainter limits. From both cluster catalogs, we select an initial list of candidate GCs to have $B-V \geq 0.5$ and $V-I \geq 0.73$~mag, then remove likely contaminants (including reddened young clusters, background galaxies misclassified by the neural network, and chance superpositions/blends of stars) after a careful visual inspection. We find that $\approx86$ % of the color-selected candidates classified as spherically symmetric, and $\approx68$ of those classified as centrally concentrated but asymmetric are likely to be GCs. The luminosity functions of the GC candidates in 2 of our 17 galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 3627, are atypical, and continue to rise at least 1~mag fainter than the expected turnover near $M_V \sim -7.4$. These faint candidate GCs have more extended spatial distributions than their bright counterparts, and may reside in the disk rather than the bulge/halo, similar to faint GCs previously discovered in M101. These faint clusters may be somewhat younger since the age-metallicity degeneracy makes it difficult to determine precise cluster ages from integrated colors once they reach $\approx1$~Gyr.</description>

      <title>No evidence of AGN features in the nuclei of Arp 220 from JWST/NIRSpec IFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arp 220 is the nearest ULIRG; it shows evidence of 100 pc-scale molecular outflows likely connected with galaxy-scale outflows traced by ionised and neutral gas. The two highly obscured nuclei of Arp 220 are the site of intense star formation, with extreme star-formation rate surface densities (~ 10^3 Msun/yr/kpc2). Despite extensive investigations searching for AGN activity in the Arp 220 nuclei, direct evidence remains elusive. We present JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations covering the 0.9 - 5.1 um wavelength range of the innermost (5''x4'', i.e. 1.8x1.5 kpc) regions of Arp 220. The primary goal is to investigate the potential presence of AGN signatures in the nuclear regions by analysing the spectra extracted from circular apertures of radius 55 pc (0.15'') around each of the two nuclei. We identify ~ 70 ionised and ~ 50 molecular emission lines in the nuclear spectra of Arp 220; we use recombination line ratios to measure optical extinctions in the range AV ~ 11 - 14 mag. High ionisation lines are not detected, except the [Mg IV] line at 4.49 um which we interpret as due to shocks rather than to AGN ionisation. We identify broadening and multiple kinematic components in the HI and H2 lines caused by outflows and shocks, with velocities up to ~ 550 km/s. Significantly higher velocities (up to ~ 900 km/s) are detected in the off-nuclear regions; however, they do not conclusively represent evidence for AGN activity. Even with the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec IFS, achieving an unambiguous identification or exclusion of the presence of an AGN in the Arp 220 system remains challenging, because of its extreme dust obscuration.</description>

      <title>CO outflows from young stars in the NGC2023 cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young early-type HAeBe stars are still embedded in the molecular clouds in which they formed. They illuminate reflection nebulae, which shape the surrounding molecular cloud and may trigger star formation. They are therefore ideal places to search for ongoing star formation activity. NGC2023 is illuminated by the Herbig Be star HD37903. It is the most massive member of a small young cluster with about 30 PMS stars, several of which are Class I objects that still heavily accrete. It might therefore be expected that they might drive molecular outflows. We examined the whole region for outflows. We analyzed previously published APEX data to search for and characterize the outflows in the NGC2023 region. This is the first systematic search for molecular outflows in this region. Since the outflows were mapped in several CO transitions, we can determine their properties quite well. We have discovered four molecular outflows in the vicinity of NGC2023, three of which are associated with Class I objects. MIR-63, a bright mid-infrared and submillimeter Class I source, is a binary with a separation of 2.4" and drives two bipolar outflows orthogonal to each other. The large southeast-northwest outflow excites the Herbig-Haro flow HH247. MIR-73, a Class I object, which is also a far-infrared source, drives a pole-on outflow. MIR-62 is a Class II object with strong infrared excess and a luminosity of 7 Lsun. It is not detected in the far-infrared. The Class I sources have bolometric luminosities of about 20 Lsun or lower, that is, they are all low-mass stars. One other far-infrared source, MIR-75, may have powered an outflow in the past because it now illuminates an egg-shaped cavity. The four outflow sources are at a similar evolutionary stage, which suggests that their formation may have been triggered by the expanding C II region.</description>

      <title>Is the RSGC4 (Alicante 8) cluster a real star cluster?: Peculiar radial velocities of red supergiant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young massive star clusters, like the six red supergiant clusters in the Scutum complex, provide valuable insights into star-formation and galaxy structures. We investigated the high-resolution near-infrared spectra of 60 RSG candidates in these clusters using the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph. Among the candidates in RSGC4, we found significant scattering in radial velocity ($-64$ km/s to $115$ km/s), unlike other clusters with velocities of $\sim$100 km/s. Most candidates in RSGC4 have $Q_{GK_s}$ values larger than 1.7, suggesting that they could be early AGB stars. Four candidates in RSGC4 exhibit infrared excess and distinct absorption features absent in other candidates. Two of these stars exhibit absorption lines resembling those of D-type symbiotic stars, showing radial velocity changes in multi-epoch observations. Analysis of relative proper motions revealed no runaway/walkaway stars in RSGC4. The dynamic properties of RSGC4 and RSGC1 differ from the disk-like motions of other clusters: RSGC4 has low normalized horizontal action $J_\mathrm{hor}=J_\mathrm{\phi}/J_\mathrm{tot}$ and vertical action $J_\mathrm{ver}=(J_\mathrm{z}-J_\mathrm{R})/J_\mathrm{tot}$ values and high eccentricities, while RSGC1 has vertical motions with high $J_\mathrm{ver}$ values and inclinations. We propose that RSGC4 may not be a genuine star cluster but rather a composite of RSGs and AGBs distributed along the line of sight at similar distances, possibly originating from various environments. Our results suggest a complex and hierarchical secular evolution of star clusters in the Scutum complex, emphasizing the importance of considering factors beyond density crowding when identifying star clusters in the bulge regions.</description>

      <title>Evidence for an Outer Component in the Continuum Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuum reverberation mapping is widely used in studying accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGN). While some indirect evidence and simulations indicated that the diffuse continuum, especially the strong Balmer continuum from the broad line region (BLR), may contribute to the continuum in the u/U band. Here, we present direct evidence for this contribution. In this work, we apply the ICCF-Cut method to continuum reverberation mapping to extract the possible diffuse continuum light curves of 6 AGNs with high cadence, high quality and multi-band observations. We find the existence of an outer component out of the accretion disk for each of 6 AGNs in the Swift U band. Meanwhile, similar results can be derived by JAVELIN Photometric Reverberation Mapping Model for 4 of them. The lags of the outer components are consistent with the predicted Balmer continuum lags, which are about half of the H$\beta$ lag values. Our result directly reinforces that an outer component, especially the Balmer continuum in the rest-frame u/U band, can contribute significantly to the continuum reverberation lags of AGNs.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Spatially Extended Stellar Population in M33: A Shallow Stellar Halo?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the outer regions of M33, beyond 15 kpc in projected distance from its center using Subaru/HSC multi-color imaging. We identify Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars and Red Clump (RC) stars using the surface gravity sensitive $NB515$ filter for the RGB sample, and a multi-color selection for both samples. We construct the radial surface density profile of these RGB and RC stars, and find that M33 has an extended stellar population with a shallow power-law index of $\alpha &gt; -3$. This result represents a flatter profile than the stellar halo which has been detected by the previous study focusing on the central region, suggesting that M33 may have a double-structured halo component, i.e. inner/outer halos or a very extended disk. Also, the slope of this extended component is shallower than those typically found for halos in large galaxies, implying intermediate-mass galaxies may have different formation mechanisms (e.g., tidal interaction) from large spirals. We also analyze the radial color profile of RC/RGB stars, and detect a radial gradient, consistent with the presence of an old and/or metal-poor population in the outer region of M33, thereby supporting our proposal that the stellar halo extends beyond 15 kpc. Finally, we estimate that the surface brightness of this extended component is $\mu_{\it V} = 35.72 \pm 0.08$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. If our detected component is the stellar halo, this estimated value is consistent with the detection limit of previous observations.</description>

      <title>RG-CAT: Detection Pipeline and Catalogue of Radio Galaxies in the EMU Pilot Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present source detection and catalogue construction pipelines to build the first catalogue of radio galaxies from the 270 $\rm deg^2$ pilot survey of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU-PS) conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. The detection pipeline uses Gal-DINO computer-vision networks (Gupta et al., 2024) to predict the categories of radio morphology and bounding boxes for radio sources, as well as their potential infrared host positions. The Gal-DINO network is trained and evaluated on approximately 5,000 visually inspected radio galaxies and their infrared hosts, encompassing both compact and extended radio morphologies. We find that the Intersection over Union (IoU) for the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes is larger than 0.5 for 99% of the radio sources, and 98% of predicted host positions are within $3^{\prime \prime}$ of the ground truth infrared host in the evaluation set. The catalogue construction pipeline uses the predictions of the trained network on the radio and infrared image cutouts based on the catalogue of radio components identified using the Selavy source finder algorithm. Confidence scores of the predictions are then used to prioritize Selavy components with higher scores and incorporate them first into the catalogue. This results in identifications for a total of 211,625 radio sources, with 201,211 classified as compact and unresolved. The remaining 10,414 are categorized as extended radio morphologies, including 582 FR-I, 5,602 FR-II, 1,494 FR-x (uncertain whether FR-I or FR-II), 2,375 R (single-peak resolved) radio galaxies, and 361 with peculiar and other rare morphologies. We cross-match the radio sources in the catalogue with the infrared and optical catalogues, finding infrared cross-matches for 73% and photometric redshifts for 36% of the radio galaxies.</description>

      <title>Predictions for CO emission and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor in galaxy simulations with non-equilibrium chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our ability to trace the star-forming molecular gas is important to our understanding of the Universe. We can trace this gas using CO emission, converting the observed CO intensity into the H$_2$ gas mass of the region using the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor Xco. In this paper, we use simulations to study the conversion factor and the molecular gas within galaxies. We analysed a suite of simulations of isolated disc galaxies, ranging from dwarfs to Milky Way-mass galaxies, that were run using the FIRE-2 subgrid models coupled to the CHIMES non-equilibrium chemistry solver. We use the non-equilibrium abundances from the simulations, and we also compare to results using abundances assuming equilibrium, which we calculate from the simulation in post-processing. Our non-equilibrium simulations are able to reproduce the relation between CO and H$_2$ column densities, and the relation between Xco and metallicity, seen within observations of the Milky Way. We also compare to the xCOLD GASS survey, and find agreement with their data to our predicted CO luminosities at fixed star formation rate. We also find the multivariate function used by xCOLD GASS overpredicts the H$_2$ mass for our simulations, motivating us to suggest an alternative multivariate function of our fitting, though we caution that this fitting is uncertain due to the limited range of galaxy conditions covered by our simulations. We also find that the non-equilibrium chemistry has little effect on the conversion factor (&lt;5\%) for our high-mass galaxies, though still affects the H$_2$ mass and Lco by $\approx$25\%.</description>

      <title>Observing the Galactic Underworld: Predicting photometry and astrometry from compact remnant microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) are largely undetectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. For this reason, our only real prospect of observing these isolated compact remnants is via microlensing; a feat recently performed for the first time. However, characterisation of the microlensing events caused by BHs and NSs is still in its infancy. In this work, we perform N-body simulations to explore the frequency and physical characteristics of microlensing events across the entire sky. Our simulations find that every year we can expect $88_{-6}^{+6}$ BH, $6.8_{-1.6}^{+1.7}$ NS and $20^{+30}_{-20}$ stellar microlensing events which cause an astrometric shift larger than 2~mas. Similarly, we can expect $21_{-3}^{+3}$ BH, $18_{-3}^{+3}$ NS and $7500_{-500}^{+500}$ stellar microlensing events which cause a bump magnitude larger than 1~mag. Leveraging a more comprehensive dynamical model than prior work, we predict the fraction of microlensing events caused by BHs as a function of Einstein time to be smaller than previously thought. Comparison of our microlensing simulations to events from in Gaia finds good agreement. Finally, we predict that in the combination of Gaia and GaiaNIR data there will be $14700_{-900}^{+600}$ BH and $1600_{-200}^{+300}$ NS events creating a centroid shift larger than 1~mas and $330_{-120}^{+100}$ BH and $310_{-100}^{+110}$ NS events causing bump magnitudes $&lt; -1$. Of these, $&lt;10$ BH and $5_{-5}^{+10}$ NS events should be detectable using current analysis techniques. These results inform future astrometric mission design, such as GaiaNIR, as they indicate that, compared to stellar events, there are fewer observable BH events than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Search for protostellar jets with UWISH2 in the molecular cloud complexes Vulpecula and IRDC G53.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets and outflows are the early signposts of stellar birth. Using the UKIRT Wide Field Infrared Survey for H2 (UWISH2) at 2.12 micron, 127 outflows are identified in molecular cloud complexes Vulpecula OB1 and IRDC G53.2 covering 12 square degrees of the Galactic plane. Using multi-wavelength datasets, from 1.2 to 70 micron, 79 young stellar objects (YSOs) are proposed as potential driving sources, where, $\sim$ 79% are likely Class 0/I protostars, 17% are Class II YSOs and the remaining 4% are Class III YSOs. The outflows are characterized in terms of their length, flux, luminosity and knot-spacing. The identified outflows have a median lobe length of 0.22 pc and 0.17 pc for outflows in Vulpecula OB1 and IRDC G53.2, respectively. Our analysis, from the knot spacing, reveals a typical ejection frequency of $\sim$ 1.2 kyr suggesting an intermediate type between the FU-Ori and EX-Ori type of eruptions in both cloud complexes. Furthermore, the physical parameters of the driving sources are obtained by performing radiative transfer modelling to the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which suggest that the outflows are driven by intermediate mass stars. Various observed trends between the outflow properties and the corresponding driving sources, and various interesting outflows and star forming sites, including sites of triggered star formation and protocluster forming clump with clusters of jets, are discussed. The obtained results and the identified jet-bearing protostellar sample will pave the way to understand many aspects of outflows with future high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Substructure Mass Power Spectrum of 23 SLACS Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can be used as a tool for constraining the substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies. In this study we investigate the power spectrum of dark matter perturbations in a population of 23 Hubble Space Telescope images of strong galaxy-galaxy lenses selected from The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We model the dark matter substructure as a Gaussian Random Field perturbation on a smooth lens mass potential, characterized by power-law statistics. We expand upon the previously developed machine learning framework to predict the power-law statistics by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accounts for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. For the training sets, we use the smooth lens mass potentials and reconstructed source galaxies that have been previously modelled through traditional fits of analytical and shapelet profiles as a starting point. We train three CNNs with different training set: the first using standard data augmentation on the best-fitting reconstructed sources, the second using different reconstructed sources spaced throughout the posterior distribution, and the third using a combination of the two data sets. We apply the trained CNNs to the SLACS data and find agreement in their predictions. Our results suggest a significant substructure perturbation favoring a high frequency power spectrum across our lens population.</description>

Abstract: Period change studies give a window to probe into the evolution and dynamics of Cepheids. While evolutionary period changes have been well studied both observationally and theoretically, non-evolutionary period changes lack a systematic and quantitative description. The overall objective is to have a quantitative understanding of the full picture of non-evolutionary period changes in Cepheids, to develop a formalism to disentangle it from the secular evolutionary period change. In the first part of the series of works, we aim to conduct a systematic search for non-evolutionary period changes to search for Cepheids in likely binary configuration and quantify their incidence rates in the Magellanic Clouds. We collect more than decade-long time-series photometry from the publically available survey, Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), with more than 7200 Cepheids collectively from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample contains both fundamental-mode and first overtone-mode Cepheids. Then we calculate observed minus calculated ($O-C$) diagrams to reveal the light-travel time effect (LTTE). In our search, out of an overall sample of more than 7200 Cepheids, we found 52 candidate Cepheid binary systems in the LMC (30 fundamental and 22 first overtone-mode) and 145 in the SMC (85 fundamental and 60 first overtone-mode). The majority of the sample is characterized by orbital periods of 2000-4000\,d and eccentricities of 0.2-0.5. Moreover, we report two candidates in each galaxy with the Cepheid likely existing with a giant companion. The incidence rate ratio for SMC to LMC calculated from our sample is in agreement with binary Cepheid population synthesis predictions.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XIII: Aligned Disks with Non-Settled Dust Around the Newly Resolved Class 0 Protobinary R CrA IRAS 32</title>

Abstract: Young protostellar binary systems, with expected ages less than $\sim$10$^5$ years, are little modified since birth, providing key clues to binary formation and evolution. We present a first look at the young, Class 0 binary protostellar system R CrA IRAS 32 from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA large program, which observed the system in the 1.3 mm continuum emission, $^{12}$CO (2-1), $^{13}$CO (2-1), C$^{18}$O (2-1), SO (6$_5$-5$_4$), and nine other molecular lines that trace disk, envelope, shocks, and outflows. With a continuum resolution of $\sim$0.03$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$5 au, at a distance of 150 pc), we characterize the newly discovered binary system with a separation of 207 au, their circumstellar disks, and a circumbinary disk-like structure. The circumstellar disk radii are 26.9$\pm$0.3 and 22.8$\pm$0.3 au for sources A and B, respectively, and their circumstellar disk dust masses are estimated as 22.5$\pm$1.1 and 12.4$\pm$0.6 M$_{\Earth}$. The circumstellar disks and the circumbinary structure have well aligned position angles and inclinations, indicating formation in a smooth, ordered process such as disk fragmentation. In addition, the circumstellar disks have a near/far-side asymmetry in the continuum emission suggesting that the dust has yet to settle into a thin layer near the midplane. Spectral analysis of CO isotopologues reveals outflows that originate from both of the sources and possibly from the circumbinary disk-like structure. Furthermore, we detect Keplerian rotation in the $^{13}$CO isotopologues toward both circumstellar disks and likely Keplerian rotation in the circumbinary structure; the latter suggests that it is probably a circumbinary disk.</description>

      <title>The properties of FR0 radio galaxies as intermediate objects in the evolution of radio galaxies</title>

Abstract: The counter-rotation between black holes and accretion disk configuration was introduced over a decade ago to elucidate the nature of the radio loud/radio-quiet dichotomy and the jet-disk connection, but has since been applied to a plethora of observations across space and time. We briefly review the paradigm in which counter-rotation is key for the triggering of radio galaxies and its observational support, then apply it to a series of observations concerning FR0 radio galaxies. FR0 radio galaxies appear to be radio galaxies in transition, with low-spinning black holes and thus weaker but tilted jets with respect to an earlier radio quasar phase. As a result, FR0 radio galaxies are prescribed to be in an earlier phase of star formation suppression in radio galaxies, compared to a later phase that is unlikely to be less than tens of millions of years in the future if they have enough accretion fuel to evolve into more powerful FRI radio galaxies. FR0 radio galaxies will have a greater or lesser star formation suppression feedback effect depending on how long they live. Tilted jets also enhance stellar velocities in the bulge. Because FR0 jet lengths are of the same order of magnitude as the radius of the stellar bulge, FR0 jets are prescribed to have begun, more or less recently depending on their age, to affect stellar velocity dispersions as well. As a result, they will be associated with dispersion values that tend to be larger than for characteristically non-jetted active galaxies, but smaller than giant radio galaxies such as M87 that have experienced a long-term tilted and more powerful FRI jet. With these ideas it is possible to make a coarse-grained prediction for the slope of the M-{\sigma} plane for FR0 radio galaxies with values between 4 and 8.</description>

      <title>Merging galaxies in isolated environments I. Multiband photometry, classification, stellar masses, and star formation rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.09300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extragalactic surveys provide significant statistical data for the study of crucial galaxy parameters used to constrain galaxy evolution, e.g. stellar mass (M$_*$) and star formation rate (SFR), under different environmental conditions. These quantities are derived using manual or automatic methods for galaxy detection and flux measurement in imaging data at different wavelengths. The reliability of these automatic measurements, however, is subject to mis-identification and poor fitting due to the morphological irregularities present in resolved nearby galaxies (e.g. clumps, tidal disturbances, star-forming regions) and its environment (galaxies in overlap). Our aim is to provide accurate multi-wavelength photometry (from the UV to the IR, including GALEX, SDSS, and WISE) in a sample of $\sim$ 600 nearby (z&lt;0.1) isolated mergers, as well as estimations of M$_*$ and SFR. We performed photometry following a semi-automated approach using SExtractor, confirming by visual inspection that we successfully extracted the light from the entire galaxy, including tidal tails and star-forming regions. We used the available SED fitting code MAGPHYS in order to estimate M$_*$ and SFR. We provide the first catalogue of isolated merging galaxies of galaxy mergers including aperture-corrected photometry in 11 bands (FUV, NUV, u, g, r, i, z, W1, W2, W3, and W4), morphological classification, merging stage, M$_*$, and SFR. We found that SFR and M$_*$ derived from automated catalogues can be wrong by up to three orders of magnitude as a result of incorrect photometry. Contrary to previous methods, our semi-automated method can reliably extract the flux of a merging system completely. Even when the SED fitting often smooths out some of the differences in the photometry, caution using automatic photometry is suggested as these measurements can lead to large differences in M$_*$ and SFR estimations.</description>

      <title>A high incidence of dusty H$\alpha$ emitters at $z&gt;3$ among UltraVISTA dropout galaxies in COSMOS revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have characterized 26 Spitzer/IRAC-selected sources from the SMUVS program that are undetected in the UltraVISTA DR5 H- and/or Ks-band images, covering 94 square arcmin of the COSMOS field which have deep multiwavelength JWST photometry. We analyzed the JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PRIMER survey and ancillary HST data to reveal the properties of these galaxies from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We find that the majority of these galaxies are detected by NIRCam at &lt;2 micron, with only four remaining as near-infrared dropouts in the deeper JWST images. Our results indicate that the UltraVISTA dropouts candidates are primarily located at z&gt;3 and are characterized by high dust extinctions, with a typical color excess E(B-V) = 0.5 pm 0.3 and stellar mass log(M*/Msun) = 9.5 pm 1.0. Remarkably, ~75% of these sources show a flux enhancement between the observed photometry and modeled continuum SED that can be attributed to Halpha emission in the corresponding NIRCam bands. The derived (Halpha+ N[II] + S[II]) rest-frame equivalent widths and Halpha star formation rates (SFRs) span values ~100-2200 A and ~5-375 Msun/yr, respectively. The location of these sources on the SFR-M* plane indicates that 35% of them are starbursts, 40% are main-sequence galaxies and the remaining 25% are located in the star-formation valley. Our sample includes one active galactic nucleus and six submillimeter sources, as revealed from ancillary X-ray and submillimeter photometry. The high dust extinctions combined with the flux boosting from Halpha emission explain why these sources are relatively bright Spitzer galaxies and yet unidentified in the ultradeep UltraVISTA near-infrared images.</description>

      <title>Gas inflows from cloud to core scales in G332.83-0.55: Hierarchical hub-filament structures and tide-regulated gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The massive star-forming region G332.83-0.55 contains at least two levels of hub-filament structures. The hub-filament structures may form through the "gravitational focusing" process. High-resolution LAsMA and ALMA observations can directly trace the gas inflows from cloud to core scales. We investigated the effects of shear and tides from the protocluster on the surrounding local dense gas structures. Our results seem to deny the importance of shear and tides from the protocluster. However, for a gas structure, it bears the tidal interactions from all external material, not only the protocluster. To fully consider the tidal interactions, we derived the tide field according to the surface density distribution. Then, we used the average strength of the external tidal field of a structure to measure the total tidal interactions that are exerted on it. For comparison, we also adopted an original pixel-by-pixel computation to estimate the average tidal strength for each structure. Both methods give comparable results. After considering the total tidal interactions, the slope of the $\sigma-N*R$ relation changes from 0.20 to 0.52, close to 0.5 of the pure free-fall gravitational collapse, and the correlation also becomes stronger. Thus, the deformation due to the external tides can effectively slow down the pure free-fall gravitational collapse of gas structures. The external tide tries to tear up the structure, but the external pressure on the structure prevents this process. The counterbalance between the external tide and external pressure hinders the free-fall gravitational collapse of the structure, which can also cause the pure free-fall gravitational collapse to be slowed down. These mechanisms can be called "tide-regulated gravitational collapse."</description>

      <title>870 Micron Dust Continuum of the Youngest Protostars in Ophiuchus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a 0.15$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution (21 au) ALMA 870 $\mu$m continuum survey of 25 pointings containing 31 young stellar objects in the Ophiuchus molecular clouds. Using the dust continuum as a proxy for dust mass and circumstellar disk radius in our sample, we report a mean mass of 2.8$^{+2.1}_{-1.3}$ and 2.5$^{+9.2}_{-1.1}$ M$_{\oplus}$ and a mean radii of 23.5$^{+1.8}_{-1.2}$ and 16.5$^{+2.8}_{-0.9}$ au, for Class I and Flat spectrum protostars, respectively. In addition, we calculate the multiplicity statistics of the dust surrounding young stellar objects in Ophiuchus. The multiplicity fraction (MF) and companion star fraction (CSF) of the combined Class I and Flats based solely on this work is 0.25 $\pm$ 0.09 and 0.33 $\pm$ 0.10, respectively, which are consistent with the values for Perseus and Orion. While we see clear differences in mass and radius between the Ophiuchus and Perseus/Orion protostellar surveys, we do not see any significant differences in the multiplicities of the various regions. We posit there are some differences in the conditions for star formation in Ophiuchus that strongly affects disk size (and consequently disk mass), but does not affect system multiplicity, which could imply important variation in planet formation processes.</description>

      <title>EDGES of the dark forest: A new absorption window into the composite dark matter and large scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to hunt for dark matter using dark forest/absorption features across the whole electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays, especially in the bands where there is a desert i.e. regions where no strong lines from baryons are expected. Such novel signatures can arise for dark matter models with a composite nature and internal electromagnetic transitions. The photons from a background source can interact with the dark matter resulting in an absorption signal in the source spectrum. In the case of a compact source, such as a quasar, such interactions in the dark matter halos can produce a series of closely spaced absorption lines, which we call the dark forest. We show that the dark forest feature is a sensitive probe of the dark matter self-interactions and the halo mass function, especially at the low mass end. There is a large volume of parameter space where dark forest is more sensitive compared to the best current and proposed direct detection experiments. Moreover, the absorption of CMB photons by dark matter gives rise to a global absorption signal in the CMB spectrum. For dark matter transition energies in the range $2.5\times 10^{-4}$ eV$-$ $5\times 10^{3}$ eV, such absorption features result in spectral distortions of the CMB in the COBE/FIRAS band of 60-600 GHz. If the dark matter transition frequency is $\sim$156 GHz, we show that the absorption of CMB photons by dark matter can provide an explanation for the anomalous absorption feature detected by the EDGES collaboration in 50-100 MHz range.</description>

      <title>The thesan project: public data release of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations matching reionization-era JWST observations</title>

Abstract: Cosmological simulations serve as invaluable tools for understanding the Universe. However, the technical complexity and substantial computational resources required to generate such simulations often limit their accessibility within the broader research community. Notable exceptions exist, but most are not suited for simultaneously studying the physics of galaxy formation and cosmic reionization during the first billion years of cosmic history. This is especially relevant now that a fleet of advanced observatories (e.g. James Webb Space Telescope, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, ELT, SKA) will soon provide an holistic picture of this defining epoch. To bridge this gap, we publicly release all simulation outputs and post-processing products generated within the THESAN simulation project at https://thesan-project.com. This project focuses on the $z \geq 5.5$ Universe, combining a radiation-hydrodynamics solver (AREPO-RT), a well-tested galaxy formation model (IllustrisTNG) and cosmic dust physics to provide a comprehensive view of the Epoch of Reionization. The THESAN suite includes 16 distinct simulations, each varying in volume, resolution, and underlying physical models. This paper outlines the unique features of these new simulations, the production and detailed format of the wide range of derived data products, and the process for data retrieval. Finally, as a case study, we compare our simulation data with a number of recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, affirming the accuracy and applicability of THESAN. The examples also serve as prototypes for how to utilise the released dataset to perform comparisons between predictions and observations.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI MRS Images Disk Winds, Water, and CO in an Edge-On Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST MIRI MRS observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around the young sub-solar mass star Tau 042021, acquired as part of the Cycle 1 GO program "Mapping Inclined Disk Astrochemical Signatures (MIDAS)." These data resolve the mid-IR spatial distributions of H$_2$, revealing X-shaped emission extending to ~200 au above the disk midplane with a semi-opening angle of $35 \pm 5$ degrees. We do not velocity-resolve the gas in the spectral images, but the measured semi-opening angle of the H$_2$ is consistent with an MHD wind origin. A collimated, bipolar jet is seen in forbidden emission lines from [Ne II], [Ne III], [Ni II], [Fe II], [Ar II], and [S III]. Extended H$_2$O and CO emission lines are also detected, reaching diameters between ~90 and 190 au, respectively. Hot molecular emission is not expected at such radii, and we interpret its extended spatial distribution as scattering of inner disk molecular emission by dust grains in the outer disk surface. H I recombination lines, characteristic of inner disk accretion shocks, are similarly extended, and are likely also scattered light from the innermost star-disk interface. Finally, we detect extended PAH emission at 11.3 microns co-spatial with the scattered light continuum, making this the first low-mass T Tauri star around which extended PAHs have been confirmed, to our knowledge. MIRI MRS line images of edge-on disks provide an unprecedented window into the outflow, accretion, and scattering processes within protoplanetary disks, allowing us to constrain the disk lifetimes and accretion and mass loss mechanisms.</description>
