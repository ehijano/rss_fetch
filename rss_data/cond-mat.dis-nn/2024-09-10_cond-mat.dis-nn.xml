      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Min-Max Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Min-max optimization problems, also known as saddle point problems, have attracted significant attention due to their applications in various fields, such as fair beamforming, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and adversarial learning. However, understanding the properties of these min-max problems has remained a substantial challenge. This study introduces a statistical mechanical formalism for analyzing the equilibrium values of min-max problems in the high-dimensional limit, while appropriately addressing the order of operations for min and max. As a first step, we apply this formalism to bilinear min-max games and simple GANs, deriving the relationship between the amount of training data and generalization error and indicating the optimal ratio of fake to real data for effective learning. This formalism provides a groundwork for a deeper theoretical analysis of the equilibrium properties in various machine learning methods based on min-max problems and encourages the development of new algorithms and architectures.</description>

      <title>Full distribution of the ground-state energy of potentials with weak disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P(E)$ of the ground-state energy of a single quantum particle in a potential $V(\bf x) = V_0(\bf x) + \sqrt{\epsilon} \, V_1(\bf x)$, where $V_0(\bf x)$ is a deterministic "background" trapping potential and $V_1(\bf x)$ is the disorder. In the weak-disorder limit $\epsilon \to 0$, we find that $P(E)$ scales as $P(E) \sim e^{-s(E)/\epsilon}$. The large-deviation function $s(E)$ is obtained by calculating the most likely configuration of $V(\bf x)$ conditioned on a given ground-state energy $E$. We consider arbitrary trapping potentials $V_0(\bf x)$ and white-noise disorder $V_1(\bf x)$. For infinite systems, we obtain $s(E)$ analytically in the limits $E \to \pm \infty$ and $E \simeq E_0$ where $E_0$ is the ground-state energy in the absence of disorder. We perform explicit calculations for the case of a harmonic trap $V_0(\bf x) \propto x^2$. Next, we calculate $s(E)$ exactly for a finite, periodic one-dimensional system with a homogeneous background $V_0(x)=0$. We find that, remarkably, the system exhibits a sudden change of behavior as $E$ crosses a critical value $E_c &lt; 0$: At $E&gt;E_c$, the most likely configuration of $V(x)$ is homogeneous, whereas at $E &lt; E_c$ it is inhomogeneous, thus spontaneously breaking the translational symmetry of the problem. As a result, $s(E)$ is nonanalytic: Its second derivative jumps at $E=E_c$. We interpret this singularity as a second-order dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Unifying view of fermionic neural network quantum states: From neural network backflow to hidden fermion determinant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the variational wave functions for Fermionic Hamiltonians, neural network backflow (NNBF) and hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) are two prominent classes to provide accurate approximations to the ground state. Here we develop a unifying view of fermionic neural quantum states casting them all in the framework of NNBF. NNBF wave-functions have configuration-dependent single-particle orbitals (SPO) which are parameterized by a neural network. We show that HFDS with $r$ hidden fermions can be written as a NNBF with an $r \times r$ determinant Jastrow and a restricted low-rank $r$ additive correction to the SPO. Furthermore, we show that in NNBF wave-functions, such determinant Jastrow's can generically be removed at the cost of further complicating the additive SPO correction increasing its rank by $r$. We numerically and analytically compare additive SPO corrections generated by the product of two matrices with inner dimension $r$. We find that larger $r$ wave-functions span a larger space and give evidence that simpler and more direct updates to the SPO's tend to be more expressive and better energetically. These suggest the standard NNBF approach is preferred amongst other related choices. Finally, we uncover that the row-selection used to select single-particle orbitals allows significant sign and amplitude modulation between nearby configurations and is partially responsible for the quality of NNBF and HFDS wave-functions.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Compute-In-Memory on Field-Programmable Ferroelectric Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deluge of sensors and data generating devices has driven a paradigm shift in modern computing from arithmetic-logic centric to data-centric processing. Data-centric processing require innovations at device level to enable novel compute-in-memory (CIM) operations. A key challenge in construction of CIM architectures is the conflicting trade-off between the performance and their flexibility for various essential data operations. Here, we present a transistor-free CIM architecture that permits storage, search and neural network operations on sub-50nm thick Aluminum Scandium Nitride ferroelectric diodes (FeDs). Our circuit designs and devices can be directly integrated on top of Silicon microprocessors in a scalable process. By leveraging the field-programmability, non-volatility and non-linearity of FeDs, search operations are demonstrated with a cell footprint &lt; 0.12 um2 when projected onto 45-nm node technology. We further demonstrate neural network operations with 4-bit operation using FeDs. Our results highlight FeDs as candidates for efficient and multifunctional CIM platforms.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Maze: A System With Tunable Scale Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random magnetic field configurations are ubiquitous in nature. Such fields lead to a variety of dynamical phenomena, including localization and glassy physics in some condensed matter systems and novel transport processes in astrophysical systems. Here we consider the physics of a charged quantum particle moving in a ``magnetic maze'': a high-dimensional space filled with a randomly chosen vector potential and a corresponding magnetic field. We derive a path integral description of the model by introducing appropriate collective variables and integrating out the random vector potential, and we solve for the dynamics in the limit of large dimensionality. We derive and analyze the equations of motion for Euclidean and real-time dynamics, and we calculate out-of-time-order correlators. We show that a special choice of vector potential correlations gives rise, in the low temperature limit, to a novel scale-invariant quantum theory with a tunable dynamical exponent. Moreover, we show that the theory is chaotic with a tunable chaos exponent which approaches the chaos bound at low temperature and strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Subspace-thermal discrete time crystals from phase transitions between different n-tuple discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experiment implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization fails to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is analytically proved, under a reasonable conjecture, by a new perturbation theory for unitary operators. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing discrete time crystals realized by kicking disordered systems, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as higher spatial dimensions.</description>
