      <title>Algorithmic reduction of polynomially nonlinear PDE systems to parametric ODE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential-elimination algorithms apply a finite number of differentiations and eliminations to systems of partial differential equations. For systems that are polynomially nonlinear with rational number coefficients, they guarantee the inclusion of missing integrability conditions and the statement of of existence and uniqueness theorems for local analytic solutions of such systems. Further, they are useful in obtaining systems in a form more amenable to exact and approximate solution methods.
  Maple's \maple{dsolve} and \maple{pdsolve} algorithms for solving PDE and ODE often automatically call such routines during applications. Indeed, even casual users of Maple's dsolve and pdsolve commands have probably unknowingly used Maple's differential-elimination algorithms.
  Suppose that a system of PDE has been reduced by differential-elimination to a system whose automatic existence and uniqueness algorithm has been determined to be finite-dimensional. We present an algorithm for rewriting the output as a system of parameterized ODE. Exact methods and numerical methods for solving ODE and DAE can be applied to this form.</description>

      <title>Identity Testing for Radical Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Radical Identity Testing problem (RIT): Given an algebraic circuit representing a polynomial $f\in \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_k]$ and nonnegative integers $a_1, \ldots, a_k$ and $d_1, \ldots,$ $d_k$, written in binary, test whether the polynomial vanishes at the real radicals $\sqrt[d_1]{a_1}, \ldots,\sqrt[d_k]{a_k}$, i.e., test whether $f(\sqrt[d_1]{a_1}, \ldots,\sqrt[d_k]{a_k}) = 0$. We place the problem in coNP assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), improving on the straightforward PSPACE upper bound obtained by reduction to the existential theory of reals. Next we consider a restricted version, called $2$-RIT, where the radicals are square roots of prime numbers, written in binary. It was known since the work of Chen and Kao that $2$-RIT is at least as hard as the polynomial identity testing problem, however no better upper bound than PSPACE was known prior to our work. We show that $2$-RIT is in coRP assuming GRH and in coNP unconditionally. Our proof relies on theorems from algebraic and analytic number theory, such as the Chebotarev density theorem and quadratic reciprocity.</description>

      <title>New Results on Periodic Golay Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide algorithmic methods for conducting exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs. Our methods enumerate several lengths beyond the currently known state-of-the-art available searches: we conducted exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs of all lengths $v \leq 72$ using our methods, while only lengths $v \leq 34$ had previously been exhaustively enumerated. Our methods are applicable to periodic complementary sequences in general. We utilize sequence compression, a method of sequence generation derived in 2013 by Djokovi\'c and Kotsireas. We also introduce and implement a new method of "multi-level" compression, where sequences are uncompressed in several steps. This method allowed us to exhaustively search all lengths $v \leq 72$ using less than 10 CPU years. For cases of complementary sequences where uncompression is not possible, we introduce some new methods of sequence generation inspired by the isomorph-free exhaustive generation algorithm of orderly generation. Finally, we pose a conjecture regarding the structure of periodic Golay pairs and prove it holds in many lengths, including all lengths $v \lt 100$. We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms by providing the first ever examples of periodic Golay pairs of length $v = 90$. The smallest length for which the existence of periodic Golay pairs is undecided is now $106$.</description>
