      <title>Derivation of Fokker-Planck equation from Schrodinger dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fokker_Planck equation can be derived in a consistent manner through a microscopic approach based on a unified scheme of classical and quantum mechanics. Here we shall derive it through a purely quantum mechanical approach based on the reversible Schrodinger dynamics. We also give a brief discussion of the path integral representation of the Fokker_Planck equation in light of our derivation. We conclude that, because of the use of the representation of eigenstates of the time-independent Hamiltonian in our derivation, the thermodynamical entropy in this case must correspond to a coarse-graining of the quantum entropy.</description>

      <title>Routing-Aware Placement for Zoned Neutral Atom-based Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to solve previously intractable problems, with neutral atoms emerging as a promising technology. Zoned neutral atom architectures allow for immense parallelism and higher coherence times by shielding idling atoms from interference with laser beams. However, in addition to hardware, successful quantum computation requires sophisticated software support, particularly compilers that optimize quantum algorithms for hardware execution. In the compilation flow for zoned neutral atom architectures, the effective interplay of the placement and routing stages decides the overhead caused by rearranging the atoms during the quantum computation. Sub-optimal placements can lead to unnecessary serialization of the rearrangements in the subsequent routing stage. Despite this, all existing compilers treat placement and routing independently thus far - focusing solely on minimizing travel distances. This work introduces the first routing-aware placement method to address this shortcoming. It groups compatible movements into parallel rearrangement steps to minimize both rearrangement steps and travel distances. The implementation utilizing the A* algorithm reduces the rearrangement time by 17% on average and by 49% in the best case compared to the state-of-the-art. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qmap.</description>

      <title>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model (LVCM). Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its excitation transfer in real time. We continuously drive the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by tuning the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of just one additional vibration reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work also establishes a scalable route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of AC sensors based on Floquet time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of general Floquet Time Crystals (FTCs), including prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to resonantly induce transitions between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor, allowing a robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for different relevant initial preparations of the sensor, including ground states, low and high correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition, with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. We present our findings for both linear and nonlinear response regimes, and illustrate them for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Scaling Behavior in Sparse Subnetwork Representations of Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits that within overparametrized neural networks, there exist sparse subnetworks that are capable of matching the performance of the original model when trained in isolation from the original initialization. We extend this hypothesis to the unsupervised task of approximating the ground state of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, a problem equivalent to finding a neural-network compression of the lowest-lying eigenvector of an exponentially large matrix. Focusing on two representative quantum Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the toric code (TC), we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can reach accuracies comparable to their dense counterparts, even when pruned by more than an order of magnitude in parameter count. Crucially, and unlike the original LTH, we find that performance depends only on the structure of the sparse subnetwork, not on the specific initialization, when trained in isolation. Moreover, we identify universal scaling behavior that persists across network sizes and physical models, where the boundaries of scaling regions are determined by the underlying Hamiltonian. At the onset of high-error scaling, we observe signatures of a sparsity-induced quantum phase transition that is first-order in shallow networks. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning enhances interpretability by linking the structure of sparse subnetworks to the underlying physics of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Sample importance for data-driven decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven decoding (DDD) -- learning to decode syndromes of (quantum) error-correcting codes using training examples -- can be a difficult problem due to several atypical and poorly understood properties of the training data. We introduce a theory of example importance that clarifies these unusual aspects of DDD: For instance, we show that DDD of a simple error-correcting code is equivalent to a noisy, imbalanced binary classification problem. This suggests that an existing data augmentation technique -- turning the knob to increase error rates in training data -- actually introduces a tradeoff between class imbalance and label noise. We apply this technique in experiments showing robust improvements to decoder accuracy while explaining the failures of this technique in terms of example importance. We show similar improvements for decoding quantum codes involving multiple rounds of syndrome measurements and we characterize example importance in random stabilizer codes, suggesting broad applicability of both example importance and turning the knob for improving experimentally relevant data-driven decoders.</description>

      <title>Information-Computation Gaps in Quantum Learning via Low-Degree Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data, designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical formalism underlying the emergence of enantio-sensitive molecular orientation due to photoionization or photoexitation of chiral molecules. We consider geometric quantities such as the Berry connection and Berry curvature in light-driven chiral electronic states in the space of complex light polarization vectors. The parametric dependence of the light-driven electronic wavefunction on such vectors emerges due to various possible mutual orientations between the laser field and a chiral molecule. Using the tools of differential geometry we show how the enantio-sensitive observables emerge from the geometry of the molecular response in such spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum cooling below absolute zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to other perovskites in its family, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits a significant softening of the ferroelectric mode with decreasing temperature, a behavior that typically heralds the onset of a ferroelectric transition. However, this material remains paraelectric down to 0K due to the Heisenberg quantum uncertainty principle that prevents atoms from localizing in the ferroelectric minima, a fundamental limit that appears impossible to overcome. This work shows that in the strong out-of-equilibrium regime induced by resonant mid-IR pulses, quantum fluctuations can be suppressed, effectively cooling the material below the 0K ground state and inducing a ferroelectric transition in SrTiO$_3$ that is otherwise impossible. The appearance of a metastable state, that is distinct from the conventional ground state, is the first demonstration of how it is possible to leverage and control quantum fluctuations with pulsed light to qualitatively alter the free energy landscape of a quantum system. We predict the conditions and system parameter under which induced non-equilibrium state can be long-lived and even permanent. In providing a quantitative description, based on first principles machine learned potential energy surface, we explain recent experimental observations of light-induced ferroelectric transition in this material.</description>

      <title>Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel timelike quantum energy teleportation (QET) protocol within the 1+1 dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, an interacting fermionic field theory exhibiting spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. By coupling localized Unruh-DeWitt detectors to the fermionic field, we demonstrate how an initial observer's measurement enables a second observer to extract energy at a later time using only classical information transfer. This protocol leverages the NJL vacuum's rich entanglement structure, driven by the chiral condensate, to facilitate energy transfer without physical particle transport. We derive the energy flows and explore the roles of measurement and time evolution and validate the protocol through quantum circuit simulations on a lattice-regularized NJL model. Our findings highlight the NJL model's potential as a platform for exploring QET in interacting quantum field theories and pave the way for experimental realizations on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Quantum Thermal State Preparation via Local Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta}\propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved {in principle} by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F. Chen {\it et al}, arXiv:2311.09207] -- their implementation requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging {in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices. Here, we propose a scheme for approximately preparing quantum thermal states that only requires the [repeated] implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous performance guarantees independent of detailed physical knowledge of $H$ beyond its locality.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Excited State Population and Coherence via Adiabatic Tunneling Ionization and Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling ionization followed by strong-field excitation leads to important ultrafast phenomena such as charge migration and lasing. Recent theoretical developments suggest that the population of the ionic excited state can be greatly enhanced due to the complex interplay between tunneling and excitation. In this Letter, using an adiabatic approach for both tunneling and excitation, semi-analytical solutions are derived for the population and coherence of a two-level ionic system. This approach removes the strong-field dressing, revealing novel sub-half-cycle processes for excited state population and coherence buildup. It predicts that the excited state population is enhanced by an order of magnitude, independent of the laser wavelength, while coherence amplitude can be boosted by over four orders of magnitude for a multi-cycle pulse. For a single-cycle pulse, it suggests that coherence amplitude decreases rapidly as the wavelength increases. This work introduces a novel framework for generating and controlling the electronic excited state and coherence using intense laser pulses, with applications in strong-field control of chemistry and lasing.</description>

      <title>Counterfactuals in Macroscopic Quantum Physics: Irreversibility, Measurement and Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can quantum theory be applied on all scales? While there are many arguments for the universality of quantum theory, this question remains a subject of debate. It is unknown how far the existence of macroscopic irreversibility can be derived from or reconciled with time-reversal symmetric quantum dynamics. Furthermore, reasoning about quantum measurements can appear to produce surprising and even paradoxical outcomes. The classical outcomes of quantum measurements are in some contexts deemed to violate the fundamental principle of locality, in particular when considering entanglement and Bell non-locality. Therefore measurement, irreversibility and locality can all appear to challenge the universality of quantum theory. In this thesis we approach these problems using counterfactuals -- statements about the possibility and impossibility of transformations. Using the principles of constructor theory and quantum information theory, we find novel features of quantum thermodynamics relating to irreversibility, information erasure and coherence. We also develop tools to quantify the full implications of non-commutativity of quantum operators in settings where quantum theory is applied universally to measurement devices. This reveals new ways of characterising the quantum information stored in entanglement and quantum branching structure. Our results reinforce the ability of universal quantum theory to consistently describe both microscopic and macroscopic observers and thermodynamic systems.</description>

Abstract: The prediction of material degradation is an important problem to solve in many industries. Environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, are important drivers of degradation processes, with corrosion being one of the most prominent ones. Quantum machine learning is a promising research field but suffers from well known deficits such as barren plateaus and measurement overheads. To address this problem, recent research has examined quantum reservoir computing to address time-series prediction tasks. Although a promising idea, developing circuits that are expressive enough while respecting the limited depths available on current devices is challenging. In classical reservoir computing, the onion echo state network model (ESN) [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-72359-9_9] was introduced to increase the interpretability of the representation structure of the embeddings. This onion ESN model utilizes a concatenation of smaller reservoirs that describe different time scales by covering different regions of the eigenvalue spectrum. Here, we use the same idea in the realm of quantum reservoir computing by simultaneously evolving smaller quantum reservoirs to better capture all the relevant time-scales while keeping the circuit depth small. We do this by modifying the rotation angles which we show alters the eigenvalues of the quantum evolution, but also note that modifying the number of mid-circuit measurements accomplishes the same goals of changing the long-term or short-term memory. This onion QRC outperforms a simple model and a single classical reservoir for predicting the degradation of aluminum alloys in different environmental conditions. By combining the onion QRC with an additional classical reservoir layer, the prediction accuracy is further improved.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Resolved Higher Order Photon Statistics of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photon statistics of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) exhibit dependencies on wavelength, pump power, and coincidence time. Notably, the average photon numbers were found to asymmetrically increase with increasing pump power around the degenerate wavelength of emission. By the coupling of the detection scheme to a spectrometer, studying different bandwidths within the emission revealed that shorter wavelengths increased nonlinearly with pump power, while longer wavelengths showed more linear behavior, indicating a wavelength dependent efficiency in the generation of the SPDC. We employ the use of a four detector Hanbury Brown and Twiss Interferometer to study the photon statistics of the signal beam, where the idler serves as the herald. The measured statistics were found to be best described by a Negative Binomial Distribution, which is a characteristic of thermal light sources. The detection and characterization of complex light sources has wide ranging applications in the fields of quantum metrology, quantum communications, and quantum computing, more specifically, a system that is sensitive to wavelength and photon number distribution.</description>

      <title>Markovian heat engine boosted by quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the role of quantum coherence as a thermodynamic resource in a noisy, Markovian one-qubit heat engine. We demonstrate that, when operating according to a quantum Otto cycle, can surpass the classical efficiency limit by consuming the coherence of noisy quantum states. Computed Leggett-Garg temporal correlations imply the engine's non-classical nature. Amplitude damping significantly reduces efficiency and extractable work. In contrast, phase damping has no significant impact on the extractable work. We implement the entire Otto cycle in a quantum circuit, simulating realistic amplitude and phase damping channels, as well as gate-level noise. We introduce an operational measure of the circuit's thermodynamic cost, establishing a direct link between energy consumption and information processing in quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Optimizing QUBO on a quantum computer by mimicking imaginary time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving QUBO problems using an Imaginary Time Evolution-Mimicking Circuit (ITEMC). The circuit parameters are optimized to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, using only single- and two-qubit expectation values. This significantly reduces the measurement overhead by avoiding full energy evaluation. By updating the initial state based on results from last step iteratively, the algorithm quickly converges to the low-energy solutions. With a pre-sorting step that optimizes quantum gate ordering based on QUBO coefficients, the convergence is further improved. Our classical simulations achieve approximation ratios above 0.99 up to 150 qubits. Furthermore, the linear scaling of entanglement entropy with system size suggests that the circuit is challenging to simulate classically using tensor networks. We also demonstrate hardware runs on IBM's device for 40, 60, and 80 qubits, and obtain solutions compatible with that from simulated annealing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book chapter gives a selective review of physical implementations and applications of superoscillations and associated phenomena. We introduce the field by reviewing simple examples of superoscillations and showing how their existence naturally follows from the real part of the quantum mechanical weak value, which the parallel phenomena of supergrowth naturally follows from the imaginary part. Focusing on electromagnetic applications, we review the topics of superoscillation and supergrowth in speckle, creating superoscillating hot spots with patterned filters, superspectroscopic discrimination of two molecules, noise mitigation and the engineering of super behavior in point spread functions for the purpose of optical superresolution. We also cover a variety of different methods for creating superoscillatory and supergrowing functions, reviewing both mathematical and physical ways to create this class of functions, and beyond. Promising directions for future research, including superoscillations in other wave phenomena, super radar, and generalized super-phenomena in quantum physics, are outlined.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulations of a Two-Dimensional Frustrated Transverse-Field Ising Model on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Page curve is a curve of average subsystem entropy as a function of subsystem size. The curve starts from 0, rises, peaks near the maximal possible entropy when the subsystem makes up half of the total system, and then falls back to 0. We here describe subsystem entropy, averaging over quantum states, and why the curve rises and falls in that manner. We also discuss the connection between the curve and the black hole information paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we use optimal control to generate Discrete Time Crystals (DTC) in generic many-body quantum systems. We define appropriate cost functions, which, when optimized, result in the formation of DTCs. This hitherto unexplored method represents DTCs as an optimization problem, and allows us to find non-trivial realistic periodic control pulses and parameter regimes which result in spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry in quantum systems. We exemplify our approach using many-body quantum systems in the presence, as well as absence of dissipation. We also discuss possible experimental realization of the control protocol for generating DTCs.</description>

      <title>Beyond mean-field dynamics of the Dicke model with non-Markovian dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a density matrix-based time dependent projection operator formalism to calculate the beyond mean-field dynamics of systems with non-Markovian local baths and one-to-all interactions. Such models encapsulate the physics of condensed phase systems immersed in optical cavities. We use this method, combined with tensor network influence functionals, to study the dynamics of the Dicke model coupled to non-Markovian local dephasing baths at zero temperature, which has a superradiant phase transition in the mean-field limit. The method corrects a spurious initial state dependence found in the mean-field dynamics and describes the emergence of new time scales which are absent in the mean-field dynamics. Our formalism, based on density matrices, is applicable to other quantum optical systems with one-to-all interactions at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>On the generic increase of entropy in isolated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm logarithmic entropy scaling, consistent with predictions derived from ETH-governed eigenstate mixing. The derived self-consistent equations for energy shift and broadening parameters agree closely with numerical results. These results unify observational entropy concepts with von Neumann entropy dynamics, providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. Our findings resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Approximate $k$NN Algorithm via Granular-Ball Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High time complexity is one of the biggest challenges faced by $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$NN). Although current classical and quantum $k$NN algorithms have made some improvements, they still have a speed bottleneck when facing large amounts of data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm called Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN). This approach achieves higher efficiency by first employing granular-balls, which reduces the data size needed to processed. The search process is then accelerated by adopting a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the time-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via quantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search process. By combining the use of granular-balls and quantization of the HNSW method, our approach manages to take advantage of these treatments and significantly reduces the time complexity of the $k$NN-like algorithms, as revealed by a comprehensive complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Bridging the classical and quantum regimes in a dissipative Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of a dissipative Ising chain with varying quantum correlation. Invoking an ensemble-average formalism, and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide an effective description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures, and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.</description>

      <title>Two identical 1D anyons with zero-range interactions: Exchange statistics, scattering theory, and anyon-anyon mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While elementary particles obey either bosonic or fermionic exchange statistics, generalized exchange statistics that interpolate between bosons and fermions -- applicable to quasi-particles -- constitute an intriguing topic, both from the fundamental and practical points of view. This work develops a scattering framework for two identical 1D bosonic anyons and two identical 1D fermionic anyons with zero-range contact interactions. The two-body system with zero-range interactions, both in free space and under external confinement, is used to illustrate the recently proposed bosonic-anyon -- fermionic-anyon mapping~(R. Hidalgo-Sacoto {\em{et al.}}, arXiv:2505.17669), which connects the eigenstates of bosonic anyons to those of fermionic anyons and vice versa. Performing explicit calculations for two-particle systems, the momentum distributions and the off-diagonal correlations of the single-particle density matrix for bosonic anyons and fermionic anyons are confirmed to be distinct. We also confirm the previously derived asymptotic coefficients of the momentum distribution tail at orders $k^{-2}$ and $k^{-3}$ for two harmonically confined anyons. Non-universal contributions at order $k^{-4}$ are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson Sampling, a non-universal computing paradigm, has resulted in impressive claims of quantum supremacy. ORCA Computing have developed a time-bin interferometer (TBI) that claims to use the principles of boson sampling to solve a number of computational problems including optimisation and generative adversarial networks. We solve a dominating set problem with a surveillance use case on the ORCA TBI simulator to benchmark the use of these devices against classical algorithms. Simulation has been used to consider the optimal performance of the computing paradigm without having to factor in noise, errors and scaling limitations. We show that the ORCA TBI is capable of solving moderately sized (n&lt;250) dominating set problems with comparable success to linear programming and greedy methods. Wall clock timing shows that the simulator has worse scaling than the classical methods, but this is unlikely to carry over to the physical device where the outputs are measured rather than calculated.</description>

      <title>Graded Paraparticle Algebra of Majorana Fields for Multidimensional Quantum Computing with Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that integrates Majorana's infinite-component relativistic equation within the algebraic structure of paraparticles through the minimal nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$--graded Lie algebras and $R$-matrix quantization. By mapping spin-dependent mass spectra to graded sectors associated with generalized quantum statistics, we derive an equation embodying Majorana's mass-spin relation describing Majorana quasiparticles of structured light carrying spin and orbital angular momentum. These quanta in the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$--graded algebras and $R$-matrix formulations extend the previous results from superconducting qubits to photonic platforms and set up deterministic 2-photon gates involving at least two qubits encoded in a single photon without nonlinear effects. This makes feasible general quantum computing pathways exploiting fractional statistics through Nelson's quantum mechanics and implement a novel procedure for error correction in photonic platforms. Furthermore, this approach makes possible to set paraparticle-based quantum information processing, beyond fermions and bosons, using graded qudits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of quantum computers in recent years, the importance of performance evaluation in quantum algorithms has been increasing. One method that has gained attention for performing this evaluation on classical computers is tensor networks. Tensor networks not only reduce the computational cost required for simulations by using approximations but are also deeply connected to entanglement. Entanglement is one of the most important elements for the quantum advantages of quantum algorithms, but the direct relationship between quantum advantages and entanglement remains largely unexplored. Tensor networks are promising as a means to address this question. In this study, we focus on the entanglement in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This study aims to investigate entanglement in QAOA by examining the relationship between the approximation rates of tensor networks and the performance of QAOA. Specifically, we actually perform tensor network simulations of QAOA on a classical computer and extend the study of the scaling relations presented in previous research. We have discovered that scaling relations hold even when entanglement entropy is used as the vertical axis. Furthermore, by analyzing the results of the numerical calculations, we propose a new function for the scaling relation. Additionally, we discovered interesting relationships regarding the behavior of entanglement in QAOA during our analysis. This research is expected to provide new insights into the theoretical foundation of the scaling relations presented in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Intermediate State Formation of Topologically Associated Chromatin Domains using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically Associating Chromatic Domains are spatially distinct chromatin regions that regulate transcription by segregating active and inactive genomic elements. Empirical studies show that their formation correlates with local patterns of epigenetic markers, yet the precise mechanisms linking 1D epigenetic landscapes to 3D chromatin folding remain unclear. Recent models represent chromatin as a spin system, where nucleosomes are treated as discrete-state variables coupled by interaction strengths derived from genomic and epigenomic data. Classical samplers struggle with these models due to high frustration and dense couplings. Here, we present a quantum annealing (QA) approach to efficiently sample chromatin states, embedding an epigenetic Ising model into the topology of D-Wave quantum processors.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of thermodynamically consistent quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to determine what quantum operations and measurements are consistent with the laws of thermodynamics, one must start by allowing all processes allowed by the framework of quantum theory, and then impose the laws of thermodynamics as a set of constraints. Here, we consider a hierarchy of quantum operations and measurements that are consistent with ($I$) the weak third law, ($II$) the strong third law, and ($III$) both the second and the third laws of thermodynamics, i.e., operations and measurements that are fully consistent with thermodynamics. Such characterisation allows us to identify which particular thermodynamic principle is responsible for the (un)attainability of a given quantum operation or measurement. In the case of channels, i.e., trace-preserving operations, we show that a channel belongs to ($I$) and ($II$) if and only if it is strictly positive and rank non-decreasing, respectively, whereas a channel belongs to ($III$) only if it is rank non-decreasing and does not perturb a strictly positive state. On the other hand, while thermodynamics does not preclude the measurability of any POVM, the realisable state-update rules for measurements are increasingly restricted as we go from ($I$) to ($III$).</description>

      <title>Optimal Control by Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms hold great promise for solving quantum control problems on near-term quantum computers. In this work, we employ the hybrid framework that integrates digital quantum simulation with classical optimization to achieve optimal engineering of quantum many-body systems. To evaluate the overall performance of this method, we introduce a general metric termed control optimality, which accounts for constraints on both classical and quantum components. As a concrete example, we investigate the time-optimal control for perfect state transfer in a one-dimensional spin model using the variational quantum algorithm, closely approaching the quantum speed limit. Moreover, we discuss the emergent gradient behavior and error robustness, demonstrating the feasibility of applying hybrid quantum algorithms to solve quantum optimal control problems. These results establish a systematic framework for hybrid algorithms to address quantum control problems on near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Estimation Loss Control in Variational Quantum Sensing via Online Conformal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum algorithms with online conformal inference to achieve reliable quantum sensing on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity of quantum optomechanical gyroscope by optical Kerr effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to enhance the sensitivity of a quantum optomechanical gyroscope (QOMG) by optical Kerr effect. We utilize quantum Fisher information (QFI) to evaluate the metrological potential of the QOMG scheme. It is found that the Kerr interaction can significantly enhances the sensitivity of the QOMG. We observe the super-Hesenberg scaling of parameter estimation precision. Furthermore, we also evaluate the performance of QOMG for the quadrature measurement. It is indicated that the sensitivity in the quadrature measurement scheme can saturate the quantum Crmam\'{e}r-Rao bound. We study the effect of the driving and dissipation of the optical cavity on the QFI, and find that the sensitivity can be manipulated by changing the driving while dissipation decreases the sensitivity. The work shows that the photon nonlinear interaction can improve sensitivity of QOMG, and demonstrates a valuable quantum resource for the QOMG. These results could have a wide-ranging impact on developing high-performance QOMG in the future.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents already in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules via circularly polarized light and show that the resulting spin-resolved current has three components whose magnitudes are comparable and can be larger than PECD: (i) a spin-polarization vortex in the plane of light polarization that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers, (ii) either a spin-sink or source in the plane of light polarization for opposite enantiomers, and (iii) a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality.</description>

      <title>Extending and measuring dephasing times of nuclear spins in NV centers of diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long coherence times rank among the most important performance measures for many different types of quantum technology. In NV centers of diamond, the nuclear spins provide particularly long dephasing times. However, since initialization and readout require assistance from the electron spin, the apparent dephasing times can be reduced by the electron spin lifetime. Here we propose and implement schemes for measuring and extending the dephasing times of nuclear spins, resulting in dephasing times that are longer than the longitudinal relaxation time $T_{1}$ of the electron spin.</description>

      <title>Scalable decoding protocols for fast transversal logic in the surface code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) approaches to quantum computing are promising due to their increased connectivity, long coherence times and apparent scalability. However, they have a significantly reduced cadence of syndrome extraction compared to superconducting devices, a potentially crippling slow-down given the substantial logical gate counts required for quantum advantage. Transversal logic, which exploits higher connectivity, has the potential to significantly speed up the logical clock rate by reducing the number of syndrome extraction rounds required, but current decoders for fast transversal logic are not scalable. This is not just because existing decoders are too slow to handle the large decoding volumes resulting from fast logic; transversal logic breaks the key structural properties that make real-time decoding of lattice surgery efficient. We introduce two new, windowed decoding protocols for transversal logic in the surface code that restore modularity and locality to the decoding problem. Using our protocols, we show that, with a very small space overhead, our scalable decoders unlock an order of magnitude speed-up for transversal logic compared to lattice surgery. Taken together, our results provide key evidence for the viability of large-scale algorithms on AMO qubits.</description>

Abstract: The Hilbert transform has been one of the foundational transforms in signal processing, finding it's way into multiple disciplines from cryptography to biomedical sciences. However, there does not exist any quantum analogue for the Hilbert transform. In this work, we introduce a formulation for the quantum Hilbert transform (QHT)and apply it to a quantum steganography protocol. By bridging classical phase-shift techniques with quantum operations, QHT opens new pathways in quantum signal processing, communications, sensing, and secure information hiding.</description>

      <title>Fast-tracking and disentangling of qubit noise fluctuations using minimal-data averaging and hierarchical discrete fluctuation auto-segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit noise and fluctuations of the noise over time are key factors limiting the performance of quantum computers. Characterising them with high temporal resolution is challenging due to multiple overlapping stochastic processes such as discrete jumps and continuous drifts. Hence, experiments typically probe individual sources of fluctuations rather than concurrent fluctuations caused by multiple sources. To overcome this limitation we develop a framework comprising a noise characterisation method with minimal measurements allowing high temporal resolution, combined with a hierarchical discrete fluctuation auto-segmentation tool to disentangle the overlapping fluctuations without human intervention, enabling their characterisation and tracking over long times. We show that on transmon qubits the method can track and disentangle qubit frequency fluctuations with temporal resolution of a few tens of milliseconds over hours. This enables us to identify the origins of the fluctuations as overlapping charge parity and two-level-systems switching. Beyond insights into the fluctuation origins, our method also provides information that can be used to improve qubit calibration, error mitigation and error correction.</description>

      <title>Fischer Information of a Nonequilibrium Anharmonic Donor-Acceptor Rectifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a nonequilibrium donor-acceptor quantum rectifier system coupled to an anharmonic vibrational mode, treating the vibrational dynamics both as a two-level system and as multilevel system. The time-dependent Fischer information is then calculated by deriving a quantum master equation for the reduced system dynamics. We estimate some key rectifier parameters, the donor energy, the acceptor energy, and the vibrational frequency. We report that there is an optimal time for estimating the donor and acceptor energy. However, the anharmonic mode can be estimated better only in the steadystate. The acceptor energy is found to be most precisely estimable, especially under strong coupling and high bias. Donor energy shows limited sensitivity, while vibrational frequency estimation benefits from low temperatures. This work offers a theoretical foundation for enhancing parameter estimation in nanoscale quantum devices, guiding future sensing and metrological applications in quantronic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graphical framework to represent entanglement in three-qubit states. The geometry associated with each entanglement class and type is analyzed, revealing distinct structural features. We explore the connection between this geometric perspective and the tangle, deriving bounds that depend on the entanglement class. Based on these insights, we conjecture a purely geometric expression for both the tangle and Cayley's hyperdeterminant for non-generic states. As an application, we analyze the energy eigenstates of physical Hamiltonians, identifying the sufficient conditions for genuine tripartite entanglement to be robust under symmetry-breaking perturbations and level repulsion effects.</description>

      <title>Fluxonium as a control qubit for bosonic quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic codes in superconducting resonators are a hardware-efficient avenue for quantum error correction and can harness the favorable error hierarchies provided by long-lived cavities compared to typical superconducting qubits. These benefits can be negated, however, by the necessary coupling to an ancillary control qubit, which often induces highly detrimental effects such as excess decoherence and undesired nonlinearities. It is thus an important question whether a qubit-cavity coupling can be realized that avoids such effects. Here, we investigate the fluxonium as control qubit, motivated by its long lifetime and controllability of Hamiltonian parameters that suggest an avenue toward controlled elimination of undesired nonlinearities. In a proof-of-concept experiment we use the fluxonium to measure the coherence properties of a storage resonator and demonstrate the predictability of the cavity's inherited nonlinearities from the fluxonium. We demonstrate universal control by preparing and characterizing resonator Fock states and their superpositions using selective number-dependent arbitrary phase gates. The fidelities of state preparation and tomography are accounted for by incoherent resonator decay errors in our planar prototype device. Finally, we predict that the fluxonium can achieve beneficial cavity-coupling regimes compared to the transmon, with the potential to eliminate undesirable cavity nonlinearities. These results demonstrate the potential of the fluxonium as a high-performance bosonic control qubit for superconducting cavities.</description>

      <title>Markovian dissipation can stabilize a (localization) quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are a cornerstone of many-body physics at low temperatures but have remained elusive far from equilibrium. Driven open quantum systems -- a prominent non-equilibrium platform where coherent dynamics competes with Markovian dissipation from the environment -- often exhibit an effective classical behavior. In this work, we present a nontrivial quantum phase transition that is stabilized, rather than destroyed, by Markovian dissipation. We consider a variant of the paradigmatic spin-boson model where the spin is driven and bosons are subject to Markovian loss proportional to frequency (hence, vanishing at low frequencies). We show that the steady state exhibits a localization phase transition where the spin's dynamics is frozen, to be contrasted with the ground-state transition in the absence of dissipation. Furthermore, this transition occurs when the steady state becomes pure. The latter is not simply a dark state of dissipation but rather emerges from a nontrivial renormalization of the spin dynamics by low-frequency bosonic modes. Our work provides a nontrivial example where quantumness, typically reserved for ground states, also emerges in dynamical settings, with potential applications in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long-living magnons in the quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherence time is the property of a quantum system that determines how long a state can hold quantum information. This parameter is directly bound to their lifetime in solid-state systems, where quantum information could be stored in quasiparticles. For decades, quasiparticles associated with magnetization order disturbance - magnons, had reported lifetimes below one microsecond at gigahertz frequencies, restricting their use as a quantum information carrier. Here, we report on the observation of short-wavelength magnons with lifetimes exceeding 18{\mu}s at millikelvin temperatures. The experiment has been performed in an ultra-pure single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet sphere in a wide range of temperatures from ambient down to 30 mK. Our results open doors for using magnons as data carriers in modern solid-state quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Telecom quantum dots on GaAs substrates as integration-ready high performance single-photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of deterministic single photon sources emitting in the telecommunication bands is a key challenge for quantum communication and photonic quantum computing. Here, we investigate the optical properties and single-photon emission of molecular beam epitaxy grown semiconductor quantum dots emitting in the telecom O- and C- bands. The quantum dots are embedded in a InGaAs matrix with fixed indium content grown on top of a compositionally graded InGaAs buffer. This structure allows for the future implementation of electrically contacted nanocavities to enable high-quality and bright QD emission. In detailed optical characterizations we observe linewidths as low as $ 50 \mu$eV, close to the spectrometer resolution limit, low fine structure splittings close to $ 10 \mu$eV, and $g^{(2)} (0)$ values as low as $0.08$. These results advance the current performance metrics for MBE-grown quantum dots on GaAs substrates emitting in the telecom bands and showcase the potential of the presented heterostructures for further integration into photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Correlation of Spacetime Fluctuations in Laser Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime fluctuations (SFs), a common feature of different proposed gravity models, could be detected using laser interferometers. In the search for SFs, a correspondence between the expected output signals and different gravity models is needed, both for guiding the design of future interferometers, and for identifying the signal in experimental data. In this work, we provide such a correspondence for some classes of SFs and geometries of the interferometers. We consider three different classes of SFs, characterised by the decay behaviours and symmetries of their two-point correlation functions. Our approach applies to Michelson laser interferometers with Fabry-P\'erot arm cavities such as the km-long LIGO detectors and those without arm cavities such as the laboratory-scale setups QUEST and GQuEST. Analysing the expected interferometer output signals, we identify three characteristic signatures for each class of SF. The designed broadband sensitivity of the laboratory-scale instruments would allow all characteristic signatures of the different classes of SFs to be observed, and such observations could provide more information on the nature of the SFs than those from LIGO. On the other hand, we find that LIGO is better suited for detecting the bare presence or absence of SFs.</description>

Abstract: Atom interferometers deployed in space are excellent tools for high precision measurements, navigation, or Earth observation. In particular, differential interferometric setups feature common-mode noise suppression and enable reliable measurements in the presence of ambient platform noise. Here we report on orbital magnetometry campaigns performed with differential single- and double-loop interferometers in NASA's Cold Atom Lab aboard the International Space Station. By comparing measurements with atoms in magnetically sensitive and insensitive states, we have realized atomic magnetometers mapping magnetic field curvatures. Our results pave the way towards precision quantum sensing missions in space.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for off-diagonal matrix elements in integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: This book is a philosopher's introduction to the idea that our universe is just one of many universes. I present and assess three versions of the idea: one version from philosophy, and two from physics. In short, they are: all the logically possible worlds; all the branches of the quantum state, in an Everettian interpretation of quantum theory; and all the bubbles of inflationary cosmology. For each proposal, I choose one main philosophical question to discuss in depth. They are, respectively: what is a possible world; what is chance; and what is explanation. But before treating these proposals and their associated questions, I set the stage by reviewing physics and philosophy from about 1600 to about 1900; and a final Chapter compares and contrasts the proposals.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has demonstrated potential for solving computationally intensive problems more efficiently than classical methods. Many software engineering tasks, such as test case selection, static analysis, code clone detection, and defect prediction, involve complex optimization, search, or classification, making them candidates for quantum enhancement. In this paper, we propose Quantum-Based Software Engineering (QBSE), a potential research direction for applying quantum computing to classical software engineering problems. We outline its scope, clarify its distinction from quantum software engineering (QSE), and identify key problem types that may benefit from quantum optimization, search, and learning techniques. We also summarize existing research efforts that remain fragmented. Finally, we sketch a preliminary research agenda that may help guide the future development of QBSE as a structured and meaningful direction within software engineering.</description>

      <title>Fermion parity and quantum capacitance oscillation with partially separated Majorana and quasi-Majorana modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent experiment, flux dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance were observed in a one dimensional spin-orbit coupled semiconductor superconductor heterostructure connected end to end via a quantum dot and threaded by a magnetic flux. In the topological superconducting phase of the heterostructure, the oscillations corresponding to different fermion parity sectors are shifted by half a period and can serve as a mechanism for fermion parity readout or fusion operations involving a pair of localized, well separated Majorana modes. In this work, we demonstrate that flux induced fermion parity dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance in a disordered semiconductor superconductor quantum dot system can originate not only from topologically protected, spatially well separated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) localized at the wire ends, but also, generically, from partially separated Majorana modes with significant overlap, as well as from quasi-Majorana modes in the topologically trivial phase, which can be viewed as Andreev bound states whose constituent Majorana wave functions are slightly shifted relative to each other and have nonzero amplitude at opposite ends of the wire. Therefore, while the detection of flux dependent oscillations of quantum capacitance marks an important experimental advance, such observations alone do not constitute evidence of the presence of topological Majorana zero modes.</description>

Abstract: A quantum process is called non-Markovian when memory effects take place during its evolution. Quantum non-Markovianity is a phenomenon typically associated with the information back-flow from the environment to the principal system, however it has been shown that such an effect is not necessary. In this work, we establish a connection between quantum non-Markovianity and the protocol of quantum teleportation in both discrete and continuous-variable systems. We also show how information flows during a teleportation protocol between the principal system and the environment in a bidirectional way leading up to a state revival.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study various quantum dynamics, it is important to develop effective methods to detect and distinguish different quantum dynamics. A common non-demolition approach is to couple an auxiliary system (ancilla) to the target system, and to measure the ancilla only. By doing so, the target system becomes an environment for the ancilla. Thus, different quantum dynamics of target systems will correspond to different environment properties. Here, we analytically study XX spin chains presenting different kinds of quantum dynamics, namely localized, delocalized, and dephasing dynamics, and build connections between Markovianity and non-Markovianity-the two most common properties of an environment. For a qubit coupled to the XX chain, we derived the reduced density matrix of the qubit through the projection method. Furthermore, when dephasing noise was introduced to the XX chain, we generalized the projection method by introducing an open-system interaction picture - a modification of the Dirac interaction picture. By calculating the reduced density matrix for the qubit analytically and numerically, we found that the delocalized (localized) chain corresponds to the Markovian (non-Markovian) bath when boundary effects are not considered, and the feature of the chain with dephasing noise as a bath is dependent on the dephasing strength. The three kinds of quantum dynamics can be distinguished by measuring the qubit only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While loss-gain-induced Langevin noises have been intensively studied in quantum optics, the effect of a complex-valued nonlinear coupling coefficient on the noises of two coupled phase-conjugated optical fields has never been questioned before. Here, we provide a general macroscopic phenomenological formula of quantum Langevin equations for two coupled phase-conjugated fields with linear loss (gain) and complex nonlinear coupling coefficient. The macroscopic phenomenological formula is obtained from the coupling matrix to preserve the field commutation relations and correlations, which does not require knowing the microscopic details of light-matter interaction and internal atomic structures. To validate this phenomenological formula, we take spontaneous four-wave mixing in a double-$\Lambda$ four-level atomic system as an example to numerically confirm that our macroscopic phenomenological result is consistent with that obtained from the microscopic Heisenberg-Langevin theory. Finally, we apply the quantum Langevin equations to study the effects of linear gain and loss, complex phase mismatching, as well as complex nonlinear coupling coefficient in entangled photon pair (biphoton) generation, particularly to their temporal quantum correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum chaos is an intriguing topic and has attracted a great deal of interests in quantum mechanics and black hole physics. Recently, the exponential growth of out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has been proposed to diagnose quantum chaos and verify the correspondence principle. Here, good correspondence is found between the linear entanglement entropy and the semiclassical phase space structures in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model. The Loschmidt echo in the chaotic sea decays more faster than that in the stable island. However, the OTOCs grow exponentially at early times for the initial states centered both in the chaotic and stable regions. The exponential growth of the OTOC is attributed to quantum collapse that provides a novel mechanism of yielding exponential growth of the OTOC in quantum systems. Moreover, the quantum collapse effect is more obvious for the initial states centered in the chaotic one. The results show that in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model, the linear entanglement entropy, and Loschmidt echo are more effective than OTOC for diagnosing quantum chaotic signals.</description>

Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has been highly influential in explaining thermodynamic behavior of closed quantum systems. As of yet, it is unclear whether and how the ETH applies to non-Hermitian systems. Here, we introduce a framework that extends the ETH to non-Hermitian systems, within which expectation values of local operators reproduce statistical and scaling predictions known from Hermitian ETH. We illustrate the validity of the framework on non-Hermitian random-matrix and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Further, we show numerically how the static ETH predictions become imprinted onto the dynamics of local observables. Finally, we present a prescription for observing both ETH-obeying and ETH-violating regimes in an optical-lattice experiment that implements a disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson model. Our results generalize the celebrated ETH to the non-Hermitian setting, and they show how it affects the system dynamics, and how the salient signatures can be observed in present-day cold-atom experiments.</description>

Abstract: The potential synergy between quantum communications and future wireless communication systems is explored. By proposing a quantum-native or quantum-by-design philosophy, the survey examines technologies such as quantumdomain (QD) multi-input multi-output, QD non-orthogonal multiple access, quantum secure direct communication, QD resource allocation, QD routing, and QD artificial intelligence. The recent research advances in these areas are summarized. Given the behavior of photonic and particle-like Terahertz (THz) systems, a comprehensive system-oriented perspective is adopted to assess the feasibility of using quantum communications in future systems. This survey also reviews quantum optimization algorithms and quantum neural networks to explore the potential integration of quantum communication and quantum computing in future systems. Additionally, the current status of quantum sensing, quantum radar, and quantum timing is briefly reviewed in support of future applications. The associated research gaps and future directions are identified, including extending the entanglement coherence time, developing THz quantum communications devices, addressing challenges in channel estimation and tracking, and establishing the theoretical bounds and performance trade-offs of quantum communication, computing, and sensing.

      <title>Advantage of multi-partite entanglement for quantum cryptography over long and short ranged networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing sophistication of available quantum networks has seen a corresponding growth in the pursuit of multi-partite cryptographic protocols. Whilst the use of multi-partite entanglement is known to offer an advantage in certain abstractly motivated contexts, the quest to find practical advantage scenarios is ongoing and substantial difficulties in generalising some bi-partite security proofs still remain. We present rigorous results that address both these challenges at the same time. First, we prove the security of a variant of the GHZ state based secret sharing protocol against general attacks, including participant attacks which break the security of the original GHZ state scheme. We then identify parameters for a performance advantage over realistic bottleneck networks. We show that whilst channel losses limit the advantage region to short distances over direct transmission networks, the addition of quantum repeaters unlocks the performance advantage of multi-partite entanglement over point-to-point approaches for long distance quantum cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic symmetries of physical systems have been employed to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of systems, thereby simplifying computations. In this work, we investigate the properties of $\mathcal{M}SU(2^N)$, $\mathcal{M}$-invariant subspaces of the special unitary Lie group $SU(2^N)$ acting on $N$ qubits, for some $\mathcal{M}\subseteq M_{2^N}(\mathbb{C})$. We demonstrate that for certain choices of $\mathcal{M}$, the subset $\mathcal{M}SU(2^N)$ inherits many topological and group properties from $SU(2^N)$. We then present a combinatorial method for computing the dimension of such subspaces when $\mathcal{M}$ is a representation of a permutation group acting on qubits $(GSU(2^N))$, or a Hamiltonian $(H^{(N)}SU(2^N))$. The Kronecker product of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ matrices is employed to construct the Lie algebras associated with different permutation-invariant groups $GSU(2^N)$. Numerical results on the number of dimensions support the the developed theory.</description>

      <title>Supervised binary classification of small-scale digit images and weighted graphs with a trapped-ion quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present the results of benchmarking a quantum processor based on trapped $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions by performing basic quantum machine learning algorithms. Using a quantum-enhanced support vector machine algorithm with up to five qubits we perform a supervised binary classification on two types of datasets: small binary digit images and weighted graphs with a ring topology. For the first dataset, images are intentionally selected so that they could be classified with 100% accuracy. This allows us to specifically examine different types of quantum encodings of the digit dataset and study the impact of experimental noise. In the second dataset, graphs are divided into two categories based on the spectral structure of their Ising Hamiltonian models, which is related to the NP-hard problem. For this problem we consider an embedding of an exponentially large Hamiltonian spectrum into an entangled state of a linear number of qubits. For both problems, we study various levels of circuit optimization and found that, for all experiments conducted, we achieve classifiers with 100% accuracy on both training and testing datasets. This demonstrates that the quantum processor has the ability to correctly solve the basic classification task under consideration. As we expect, with the increase in the capabilities of quantum processors, they can be utilized for solving machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Pulse Design of Baseband Flux Control for Adiabatic Controlled-Phase Gates in Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite progress towards achieving low error rates with superconducting qubits, error-prone two-qubit gates remain a bottleneck for realizing large-scale quantum computers. Therefore, a systematic framework to design high-fidelity gates becomes imperative. One type of two-qubit gate in superconducting qubits is the controlled-phase (CPHASE) gate, which utilizes a conditional interaction between higher energy levels of the qubits controlled by a baseband flux pulse on one of the qubits or a tunable coupler. In this work, we study an adiabatic implementation of CPHASE gates and formulate the design of the control trajectory for the gate as a pulse-design problem. We show in simulation that the Chebyshev-based trajectory can, in certain cases, enable gates with gate infidelity lower by an average of 23.3% when compared to the widely used Slepian-based trajectory.</description>

Abstract: As one of the famous effects in quantum Rabi model (QRM), Rabi oscillation may lead to the occurrence of quantum dynamics behaviors without classical dynamic counterparts, such as quantum collapse and revival effects. In this paper, we focus on studying the long-time quantum signatures of chaos in the large atom-light frequency ratios Rabi model. It is shown that the saturated values of the entanglement entropy for initial states located in chaotic sea are higher than that in the regular regions, and the Husimi Q function are more dispersed in phase space. Moreover, we observed that the long-time average entanglement entropy and spin variance correspond well with the semiclassical phase space. Our results imply that the correspondence principle does not invalidated by quantum collapse and revival effects in the large atom-light frequency ratios Rabi model.</description>

      <title>A Novel Stabilizer-based Entanglement Distillation Protocol for Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement distillation, the process of converting weakly entangled states into maximally entangled ones using Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC), is pivotal for robust entanglement-assisted quantum information processing in error-prone environments. A construction based on stabilizer codes offers an effective method for designing such protocols. By analytically investigating the effective action of stabilizer protocols for systems of prime dimension $d$, we establish a standard form for the output states of recurrent stabilizer-based distillation. This links the properties of input states, stabilizers, and encodings to the properties of the protocol. Based on those insights, we present a novel two-copy distillation protocol, applicable to all bipartite states in prime dimension, that maximizes the fidelity increase per iteration for Bell-diagonal states. The power of this framework and the protocol is demonstrated through numerical investigations, which provide evidence for superior performance in terms of efficiency and distillability of low-fidelity states compared to other well-established recurrence protocols. By elucidating the interplay between states, errors, and protocols, our contribution advances the systematic development of highly effective distillation protocols, enhancing our understanding of distillability.</description>

Abstract: Here we present a non-Hermitian framework for modeling state-vector collapse under unified dynamics described by Schr\"odinger's equation. Under the premise of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics, we argue that collapse has to occur when the Hamiltonian completes a closed loop in the parameter space encoding the interaction with the meter. For two-level systems, we put forward the phenomenon of chiral state conversion as a mechanism for effectively eliminating superpositions. This perspective opens a way to simulate quantum measurements in classical systems that up to now were restricted to the Schr\"odinger part of the quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Logical qubits can be protected against environmental noise by encoding them into a highly entangled state of many physical qubits and actively intervening in the dynamics with stabilizer measurements. In this work, we numerically optimize the rate of these interventions: the number of stabilizer measurement rounds for a logical qubit encoded in a surface code patch and idling for a given time. We model the environmental noise on the circuit level, including gate errors, readout errors, amplitude and phase damping. We find, qualitatively, that the optimal number of stabilizer measurement rounds is getting smaller for better qubits and getting larger for better gates or larger code sizes. We discuss the implications of our results to some of the leading architectures, superconducting qubits, and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing crosstalk in large-scale QPUs using zero-entropy classical shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum processing units (QPUs) scale toward hundreds of qubits, diagnosing crosstalk and noise-induced correlations becomes critical for reliable quantum computation. In this work, we introduce Zero-Entropy Classical Shadows (ZECS), a diagnostic tool that reconstructs positive semidefinite, unit-trace density operators from classical shadow (CS) information. ZECS enables proper subregion tomography and reduces the effect of sampling and time-dependent errors. We apply ZECS to large superconducting QPUs, including ibm\_brisbane (127 qubits) and ibm\_fez (156 qubits), using 6,000 samples. With these samples, ZECS detects and characterizes crosstalk among disjoint qubit subsets across the full hardware topology. This information is then used to select low-crosstalk qubit subsets for executing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a 20-qubit problem. Compared to the best qubit selection via Qiskit transpilation, our method improves solution quality by 10% and increases algorithmic coherence by 33%. ZECS offers a scalable and measurement-efficient approach to diagnosing noise in large-scale QPUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-relativistic physics, the concepts of geometry and topology are usually applied to characterize spatial structures or structures in momentum space. We introduce the concept of temporal geometry, which encompasses the geometric and topological properties of temporal shapes, i.e. trajectories traced by the tip of a time-dependent vector in vector space. We apply it to vectors describing ultrafast electron currents or induced polarization in chiral molecules. The central concepts of temporal geometry - Berry curvature and Berry connection - emerge as ubiquitous features of photoexcited, non-equilibrium, chiral electron dynamics. We demonstrate that the Berry curvature and Berry connection (i) rely on the polarization properties of light pulses, (ii) can be introduced for multiphoton processes, and (iii) control enantio-sensitive geometric observables via non-equilibrium electronic dynamics excited by tailored laser fields. Our findings may open a way to ultrafast, topologically non-trivial, and enantio-sensitive chemical dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for describing nonlinear electromagnetic interactions in integrated photonic devices utilizing an asymptotic-in/out field formalism. Our method expands upon previous continuous wave asymptotic treatments by describing the evolution non-perturbatively for an arbitrary pulsed input. This is presented in the context of a squeezing interaction within an integrated microring resonator side coupled to an input/output waveguide, but is readily generalizable to other integrated structures, while including a variety of (non-squeezing) third-order interactions. An example of a single-pump, non-degenerate squeezing interaction is studied, which is shown to match well with standard coupled-mode treatments for high-finesse resonators, as well as previous perturbative treatments dealing with the generation of pairs with low probability.</description>

      <title>Quantum processes as thermodynamic resources: the role of non-Markovianity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics studies how quantum systems and operations may be exploited as sources of work to perform useful thermodynamic tasks. In real-world conditions, the evolution of open quantum systems typically displays memory effects, resulting in a non-Markovian dynamics. The associated information backflow has been observed to provide advantage in certain thermodynamic tasks. However, a general operational connection between non-Markovianity and thermodynamics in the quantum regime has remained elusive. Here, we analyze the role of non-Markovianity in the central task of extracting work via thermal operations from general multitime quantum processes, as described by process tensors. By defining a hierarchy of four classes of extraction protocols, expressed as quantum combs, we reveal three different physical mechanisms (work investment, multitime correlations, and system-environment correlations) through which non-Markovianity increases the work distillable from the process. The advantages arising from these mechanisms are linked precisely to a quantifier of the non-Markovianity of the process. These results show in very general terms how non-Markovianity of any given quantum process is a fundamental resource that unlocks an enhanced performance in thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback induced entanglement relaxation and dynamical phase transition in monitored free fermion chains with Wannier-Stark ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, measurement induced entanglement transitions (MIETs) have attracted significant attention. However, the dynamical transition associated with the feedback induced skin effect, which exhibits a wealth of intriguing phenomena, has not been fully understood. In this work, we investigate a dynamical phase transition in a tilted free-fermion chain under measurement-feedback protocols, emphasizing the particle density and entanglement entropy dynamics. We reveal a feedback induced skin effect, enhanced by the Wannier-Stark ladder potential, that creates localization at one boundary and generates an effective pseudo edge under periodic conditions. The observables show a two-stage evolution: a rapid initial logarithmic growth followed by decay into an area-law steady state. Using a rescaling analysis, we pinpoint the critical behavior and offer an intuitive physical picture that links it to the feedback-driven suppression of quantum jump fluctuations. The resulting entanglement dynamics appear to be governed by a system-size-dependent delay, followed by a size-independent relaxation process. This behavior is consistent with the ballistic propagation of free fermions toward a domain-wall-like steady state and does not exhibit any signatures of nontrivial criticality. This work provides an effective supplement to the dynamical transition. It provides valuable references for linking the dynamical understanding of the role feedback plays in MIETs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Photon Blockade with Weak Optical Nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Threshold-less and Flexibly Tunable Frequency Comb via Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized communication, metrology and spectroscopy. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated combs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency comb-that does not rely on intrinsic material non-linearity. By periodically modulating the resonance frequency of a cavity, a Floquet cavity with multiple equally spaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the pre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach offers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner, obviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation threshold. We implement this on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr optomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal far from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection is reduced by approximately a factor of \(10^6\), providing a promising platform for frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>More-efficient Quantum Multivariate Mean Value Estimator from Generalized Grover Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient algorithm for multivariate mean value estimation. Our algorithm outperforms previous work by polylog factors and nearly saturates the known lower bound. More formally, given a random vector $\vec{X}$ of dimension $d$, we find an algorithm that uses $O\left(n \log \frac{d}{\delta}\right)$ samples to find a mean estimate that $\vec{\tilde{\mu}}$ that differs from the true mean $\vec{\mu}$ by $\frac{\sqrt{\text{tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\ell^\infty$ norm and hence $\frac{\sqrt{d \text{ tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\ell^2$ norm, where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of the components of the random vector. We also presented another algorithm that uses smaller memory but costs an extra $d^\frac{1}{4}$ in complexity. Consider the Grover operator, the unitary operator used in Grover's algorithm. It contains an oracle that uses a $\pm 1$ phase for each candidate for the search space. Previous work has demonstrated that when we substitute the oracle in Grover operator with generic phases, it ended up being a good mean value estimator in some mathematical notion. We used this idea to build our algorithm. Our result remains not exactly optimal due to a $\log \frac{d}{\delta}$ term in our complexity, as opposed to something nicer such as $\log \frac{1}{\delta}$; This comes from the phase estimation primitive in our algorithm. So far, this primitive is the only major known method to tackle the problem, and moving beyond this idea seems hard. Our results demonstrates that the methodology with generalized Grover operator can be used develop the optimal algorithm without polylog overhead for different tasks relating to mean value estimation.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of the Peeling Decoder for the Quantum Expander Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of recovering from qubit erasures has recently gained attention as erasures occur in many physical systems such as photonic systems, trapped ions, superconducting qubits and circuit quantum electrodynamics. While several linear-time decoders for error correction are known, their error-correcting capability is limited to half the minimum distance of the code, whereas erasure correction allows one to go beyond this limit. As in the classical case, stopping sets pose a major challenge in designing efficient erasure decoders for quantum LDPC codes. In this paper, we show through simulation, that an attractive alternative here, is the use of quantum expander codes in conjunction with the peeling decoder that has linear complexity. We also discuss additional techniques including small-set-flip decoding, that can be applied following the peeling operation, to improve decoding performance and their associated complexity.</description>

      <title>A new approximate Eastin-Knill theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transversal encoded gatesets are highly desirable for fault tolerant quantum computing. However, a quantum error correcting code which exactly corrects for local erasure noise and supports a universal set of transversal gates is ruled out by the Eastin-Knill theorem. Here we provide a new approximate Eastin-Knill theorem for the single-shot regime when we allow for some probability of error in the decoding. In particular, we show that a quantum error correcting code can support a universal set of transversal gates and approximately correct for local erasure if and only if the conditional min-entropy of the Choi state of the encoding and noise channel is upper bounded by a simple function of the worst-case error probability. Our no-go theorem can be computed by solving a semidefinite program, and, in the spirit of the original Eastin-Knill theorem, is formulated in terms of a condition that is both necessary and sufficient, ensuring achievability whenever it is passed. As an example, we find that with $n=100$ physical qutrits we can encode $k=1$ logical qubit in the $W$-state code, which admits a universal transversal set of gates and corrects for single subsystem erasure with error probability of $\varepsilon = 0.005$. To establish our no-go result, we leverage tools from the resource theory of asymmetry, where, in the single-shot regime, a single (output state-dependent) resource monotone governs all state purifications.</description>

      <title>From Mass-Shell Factorisation to Spin: An Attempt at a Matrix-Valued Liouville Framework for Relativistic Classical and Quantum Phase-Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Liouville's theorem is first-order in time for the phase-space distribution itself, the relativistic mass-shell constraint $p^\mu p_\mu = m^2$ is naively second-order in energy. We argue that it is reasonable to unify both energy branches within a single Hamiltonian by factorizing $(p^2 - m^2)$ in analogy with Dirac's approach in relativistic quantum mechanics. We show the resulting matrix-based Liouville equation remains first order and naturally yields a $4\times4$ matrix-valued probability density function in phase space as a classical analogue of a relativistic spin-half Wigner function. We investigate its classical physics and deformation quantisation.</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization Strategies for the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz in Noisy Quantum Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a benchmark of eight optimization algorithms for variational quantum chemistry using the tVHA, evaluating performance on $H_2$, $H_4$, and $LiH$ (in both full and active spaces) under noiseless and sampling noise conditions. Sampling noise fundamentally alters optimizer behavior, with gradient-based methods performing best in ideal conditions, while population-based algorithms, such as CMA-ES, show greater resilience under noise. Hartree-Fock initialization reduces the number of function evaluations by 27-60% and consistently yields higher final accuracy compared to random starting points. We identify a precision limit set by sampling noise, with diminishing returns beyond approximately 1000 shots.</description>

      <title>How to (Un-) Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.06981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When compared to quantum mechanics, classical mechanics is often depicted in a specific metaphysical flavour: spatio-temporal realism or a Newtonian "background" is presented as an intrinsic fundamental classical presumption. However, the Hamiltonian formulation of classical analytical mechanics is based on abstract generalized coordinates and momenta: It is a mathematical rather than a philosophical framework. If the metaphysical assumptions ascribed to classical mechanics are dropped, then there exists a presentation in which little of the purported difference between quantum and classical mechanics remains. This presentation allows to derive the mathematics of relativistic quantum mechanics on the basis of a purely classical Hamiltonian phase space picture. It is shown that a spatio-temporal description is not a condition for but a consequence of objectivity. It requires no postulates. This is achieved by evading spatial notions and assuming nothing but time translation invariance.</description>

      <title>Thermal Annealing and Radiation Effects on Structural and Electrical Properties of NbN/GaN Superconductor/Semiconductor Junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 {\deg}C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 {\deg}C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 {\deg}C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Rate-reliability tradeoff for deterministic identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate deterministic identification over arbitrary memoryless channels under the constraint that the error probabilities of first and second kind are exponentially small in the block length $n$, controlled by reliability exponents $E_1,E_2 \geq 0$. In contrast to the regime of slowly vanishing errors, where the identifiable message length scales linearithmically as $\Theta(n\log n)$, here we find that for positive exponents linear scaling is restored, now with a rate that is a function of the reliability exponents. We give upper and lower bounds on the ensuing rate-reliability function in terms of (the logarithm of) the packing and covering numbers of the channel output set, which for small error exponents $E_1,E_2&gt;0$ can be expanded in leading order as the product of the Minkowski dimension of a certain parametrisation the channel output set and $\log\min\{E_1,E_2\}$. These allow us to recover the previously observed slightly superlinear identification rates, and offer a different perspective for understanding them in more traditional information theory terms. We also show that even if only one of the two errors is required to be exponentially small, the linearithmic scaling is lost. We further illustrate our results with a discussion of the case of dimension zero, and extend them to classical-quantum channels and quantum channels with tensor product input restriction.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up seven distinct fundamental phases in nature: three pure phases and four coexisting ones with mobility edges, yet a unified theory with full characterization and realization of all these phases has not been developed. Here we propose a complete and unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic (QP) system which realizes all the fundamental localization phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for their characterization. First, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spinful QP model, giving a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases and otherwise the coexisting ones. Further, we uncover a novel universal mechanism for the critical states that their emergence is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful QP model, which considerably broadens the rigorous realizations of the exotic critical states. We then show the criteria of exact solvability for the present spinful QP system, with which we construct various exactly solvable models for all distinct localization phases. In particular, we propose two novel models, dubbed spin-selective QP lattice model and QP optical Raman lattice model, to achieve all basic types of mobility edges and all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization physics, respectively. The experimental scheme is proposed and studied in detail to realize these models with high feasibility. This study establishes a complete and profound theoretical framework which enables an in-depth exploration of the broad classes of all fundamental localization phenomena in QP systems, and offers key insights for constructing their exactly solvable models with experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Unified Structural Embedding of Orbifold Sigma Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new unified structural framework for orbifold sigma models that incorporates twisted sectors, singularities, and smooth regions into a single algebraic object. Traditional approaches to orbifold theories often treat such sectors separately, requiring ad hoc regularizations near singularities and failing at capturing inter-sector interactions under renormalization group flow. Therefore, the scope of this study aims at resolving these limitations through the construction of a unified orbifold algebra $\mathcal{A}(X/G)$ that decomposes into idempotent-projected components corresponding to conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$ acting on the target space $X$. The formalism is shown to recover conventional sigma model results in the smooth limit where $G$ approaches the trivial group, with the internal renormalization group derivation reducing to the standard one-loop beta function proportional to the Ricci tensor. Examples demonstrate the applicability, including explicit calculations for the $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold that exhibit the decomposition into untwisted and twisted field contributions.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Complement of a Gravitating Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any gravitating region $a$ in any spacetime gives rise to a generalized entanglement wedge, the hologram $e(a)$. Holograms exhibit properties expected of fundamental operator algebras, such as strong subadditivity, nesting, and no-cloning. But the entanglement wedge EW of an AdS boundary region $B$ with commutant $\bar B$ satisfies an additional condition, complementarity: EW$(B)$ is the spacelike complement of EW$(\bar B)$ in the bulk.
  Here we identify an analogue of the boundary commutant $\bar B$ in general spacetimes: given a gravitating region $a$, its \emph{fundamental complement} $\tilde{a}$ is the smallest wedge that contains all infinite world lines contained in the spacelike complement $a'$ of $a$. We refine the definition of $e(a)$ by requiring that it be spacelike to $\tilde a$. We prove that $e(a)$ is the spacelike complement of $e(\tilde a)$ when the latter is computed in $a'$.
  We exhibit many examples of $\tilde{a}$ and of $e(a)$ in de Sitter, flat, and cosmological spacetimes. We find that a Big Bang cosmology (spatially closed or not) is trivially reconstructible: the whole universe is the entanglement wedge of any wedge inside it. But de Sitter space is not trivially reconstructible, despite being closed. We recover the AdS/CFT prescription by proving that EW$(B)=e($causal wedge of $B$).</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When electrons pass through chiral molecules, their transmission is strongly influenced by the orientation of their spin: molecules with opposite handedness preferentially transmit electrons with oppositely aligned spins. The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish dynamical and geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.</description>
