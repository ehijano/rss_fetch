      <title>FLAMINGO: combining kinetic SZ effect and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements to gauge the impact of feedback on large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic feedback processes associated with accreting supermassive black holes can expel gas from massive haloes and significantly alter various measures of clustering on ~Mpc scales, potentially biasing the values of cosmological parameters inferred from analyses of large-scale structure (LSS) if not modelled accurately. Here we use the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to gauge the impact of feedback on large-scale structure by comparing to Planck + ACT stacking measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect of SDSS BOSS galaxies. We make careful like-with-like comparisons to the observations, aided by high precision KiDS and DES galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements of the BOSS galaxies to inform the selection of the simulated galaxies. In qualitative agreement with several recent studies using dark matter only simulations corrected for baryonic effects, we find that the kSZ effect measurements prefer stronger feedback than predicted by simulations which have been calibrated to reproduce the gas fractions of low redshift X-ray-selected groups and clusters. We find that the increased feedback can help to reduce the so-called S8 tension between the observed and CMB-predicted clustering on small scales as probed by cosmic shear (although at the expense of agreement with the X-ray group measurements). However, the increased feedback is only marginally effective at reducing the reported offsets between the predicted and observed clustering as probed by the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect power spectrum and tSZ effect--weak lensing cross-spectrum, both of which are sensitive to higher halo masses than cosmic shear.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing of the Lyman-alpha Forest from Simulated DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent angular positions of quasars are deflected on the sky by the gravitational field sourced by foreground matter. This weak lensing effect is measurable through the distortions it introduces in the lensed quasar spectra. Discrepancies in the statistics of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectral absorption features can be used to reconstruct the foreground lensing potential. We extend the study of this method of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest weak gravitational lensing to lower angular forest spectrum source densities than previous work. We evaluate the performance of the Lyman-$\alpha$ lensing estimator of Metcalf et al. (2020) on mock data based on the angular forest source density ($50$ per square degree) and volume ($\sim$700,000 spectra total) of the DESI survey. We simulate the foreground galaxy distribution and lensing potentials with redshift evolution approximated by N-body simulation and simulate Gaussian-random Lyman-$\alpha$ forests to produce mock data for the entire DESI footprint. By correlating the foreground galaxy distribution with the potential reconstructed by the estimator, we find that a weak lensing detection with signal to noise of $\sim4$ will be possible with the full DESI data. We show that spectral surveys with low density and high volume are promising candidates for forest weak lensing in addition to the high resolution data that have been considered in previous work. We present forecasts for future spectral surveys and show that with larger datasets a detection with signal to noise $&gt;10$ will be possible.</description>

      <title>COSMIC: A Galaxy Cluster Finding Algorithm Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building a comprehensive catalog of galaxy clusters is a fundamental task for the studies on the structure formation and galaxy evolution. In this paper, we present COSMIC (Cluster Optical Search using Machine Intelligence in Catalogs), an algorithm utilizing machine learning techniques to efficiently detect galaxy clusters. COSMIC involves two steps, including the identification of the brightest cluster galaxies and the estimation of the cluster richness. We train our models on the galaxy data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and WHL galaxy cluster catalog. Validated to a test data in the region of northern Galactic cap, COSMIC algorithm demonstrates a high completeness when cross-matching with previous cluster catalogs. Richness comparison with previous optical and X-ray measurements also demonstrated a tight correlation. Our methodology showcases robust performance in galaxy cluster detection and holds promising prospects for applications in upcoming large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>CLASH-VLT: Galaxy cluster MACS J0329-0211 and its surroundings using galaxies as kinematic tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to gain new insights into the controversial dynamical status of MACS J0329-0211 (MACS0329), a massive cluster at z=0.4503, with a new analysis using a large sample of member galaxies as kinematic tracers. Our analysis is based on extensive spectroscopic data for more than 1700 galaxies obtained with the VIMOS and MUSE spectrographs at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), in combination with B and Rc Suprime-Cam photometry from the Subaru archive. According to our member selection procedure, we define a sample of 430 MACS0329 galaxies within 6 Mpc, corresponding to about 3 times the virial radius. We estimate the global velocity dispersion, sigmaV=841 km/s, and present the velocity dispersion profile. We estimate a mass M200=9.2E14 in units of solar masses, using 227 galaxies within R200=1.71 Mpc, for which sigmaV200=1018 km/s. The spatial distribution of the red galaxies traces a SE-NW elongated structure, without signs of a velocity gradient. This structure likely originates from the main phase of cluster assembly. The distribution of the blue galaxies is less concentrated, more rounded and shows signs of substructure, all characteristics indicating a recent infall of groups from the field. We detect two loose clumps of blue galaxies in the south and southwest at a distance about R200 from the cluster center. The strong spatial segregation among galaxy populations is not accompanied by kinematical difference. Thanks to our extensive catalog of spectroscopic redshift, we are able to study galaxy systems that are intervening along the line of sight. We can identify two foreground galaxy systems (GrG1 at z=0.31 and GrG2 at z=0.38) and one background system (GrG3 at z=0.47). We point out that the second brightest galaxy projected onto the MACS0329 core is in fact the dominant galaxy of the foreground group GrG2.</description>

      <title>Improving Galaxy Cluster Selection with the Outskirt Stellar Mass of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number density and redshift evolution of optically selected galaxy clusters offer an independent measurement of the amplitude of matter fluctuations, $S_8$. However, recent results have shown that clusters chosen by the redMaPPer algorithm show richness-dependent biases that affect the weak lensing signals and number densities of clusters, increasing uncertainty in the cluster mass calibration and reducing their constraining power. In this work, we evaluate an alternative cluster proxy, outskirt stellar mass, $M_{\textrm{out}}$, defined as the total stellar mass within a $[50,100]$ kpc envelope centered on a massive galaxy. This proxy exhibits scatter comparable to redMaPPer richness, $\lambda$, but is less likely to be subject to projection effects. We compare the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 redMaPPer cluster catalog with a $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected cluster sample from the Hyper-Suprime Camera survey. We use weak lensing measurements to quantify and compare the scatter of $M_{\textrm{out}}$ and $\lambda$ with halo mass. Our results show $M_{\textrm{out}}$ has a scatter consistent with $\lambda$, with a similar halo mass dependence, and that both proxies contain unique information about the underlying halo mass. We find $\lambda$-selected samples introduce features into the measured $\Delta \Sigma$ signal that are not well fit by a log-normal scatter only model, absent in $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected samples. Our findings suggest that $M_{\textrm{out}}$ offers an alternative for cluster selection with more easily calibrated selection biases, at least at the generally lower richnesses probed here. Combining both proxies may yield a mass proxy with a lower scatter and more tractable selection biases, enabling the use of lower mass clusters in cosmology. Finally, we find the scatter and slope in the $\lambda-M_{\textrm{out}}$ scaling relation to be $0.49 \pm 0.02$ and $0.38 \pm 0.09$.</description>

      <title>Composite running vacuum in the Universe: implications on the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility that the vacuum energy density (VED) could be time dependent in the expanding Universe is intuitively more reasonable than just a rigid cosmological constant for the entire cosmic history. The framework of the running vacuum model (RVM) is a salient example derived from QFT in curved spacetime, wherein the VED appears as a power series of the Hubble rate, $H(t)$, and its derivatives. The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological tensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain hardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy (DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made out of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should stress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces positive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name). The prototype is the old $\Lambda$XCDM model from 2006. Recently a simplified version of the latter, called the $w$XCDM, has proven capable to yield a truly outstanding fit to the cosmological data with dramatic implications for mitigating the cosmological tensions. The analysis is sensitive to the kind of BAO data used, transversal (2D) or anisotropic (3D). For both BAO types the overall fit quality is substantially better than for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, and the growth tension becomes alleviated. Nevertheless, only for 2D BAO the $H_0$-tension can be completely cut down. Most notably, this scenario favours (at $3.3\sigma$ c.l.) quintessence-like behavior around our time, as recently reported by the DESI Collaboration. In what follows I will summarize in very simple phenomenological terms the essentials of the RVM idea and its composite extensions, as well as the remarkable practical implications ensuing from such scenarios.</description>

      <title>PySCo: A fast Particle-Mesh $N$-body code for modified gravity simulations in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PySCo, a fast and user-friendly Python library designed to run cosmological $N$-body simulations across various cosmological models, such as $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, and alternative theories of gravity, including $f(R)$, MOND and time-dependent gravitational constant parameterisations. PySCo employs Particle-Mesh solvers, using multigrid or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods in their different variations. Additionally, PySCo can be easily integrated as an external library, providing utilities for particle and mesh computations. The library offers key features, including an initial condition generator based on up to third-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT), power spectrum estimation, and computes the background and growth of density perturbations. In this paper, we detail PySCo's architecture and algorithms and conduct extensive comparisons with other codes and numerical methods. Our analysis shows that, with sufficient small-scale resolution, the power spectrum at redshift $z = 0$ remains independent of the initial redshift at the 0.1\% level for $z_{\rm ini} \geq$ 125, 30, and 10 when using first, second, and third-order LPT, respectively. Although the seven-point Laplacian method used in multigrid also leads to power suppression on small scales, this effect can largely be mitigated when computing ratios. In terms of performance, PySCo only requires approximately one CPU hour to complete a Newtonian simulation with $512^3$ particles (and an equal number of cells) on a laptop. Due to its speed and ease of use, PySCo is ideal for rapidly generating vast ensemble of simulations and exploring parameter spaces, allowing variations in gravity theories, dark energy models, and numerical approaches. This versatility makes PySCo a valuable tool for producing emulators, covariance matrices, or training datasets for machine learning.</description>

      <title>A Jet-Induced Shock in a Young, Powerful Radio Galaxy at z=3.00</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bright radio source, GLEAM J091734-001243 (hereafter GLEAM J0917-0012), was previously selected as a candidate ultra-high redshift (z&gt;5) radio galaxy due to its compact radio size and faint magnitude (K(AB)=22.7). Its redshift was not conclusively determined from follow-up millimetre and near-infrared spectroscopy. Here we present new HST WFC3 G141 grism observations which reveal several emission lines including [NeIII]3867, [NeV]3426 and an extended (~4.8 kpc), [OII]3727 line which confirm a redshift of 3.004+/-0.001. The extended component of the [OII]3727 line is co-spatial with one of two components seen at 2.276 GHz in high resolution (60x20 mas) Long Baseline Array data, reminiscent of the alignments seen in local compact radio galaxies. The BEAGLE stellar mass (~2x10^11 Msun) and radio luminosity (L_500MHz}~10^28 W Hz^-1) put GLEAM J0917-0012 within the distribution of the brightest high-redshift radio galaxies at similar redshifts. However, it is more compact than all of them. Modelling of the radio jet demonstrates that this is a young, ~50 kyr old, but powerful, 10^39 W, compact steep spectrum radio source. The weak constraint on the active galactic nucleus bolometric luminosity from the [NeV]3426 line combined with the modelled jet power tentatively implies a large black hole mass, &gt;10^9 Msun, and a low, advection-dominated accretion rate, an Eddington ratio &lt;0.03. The [NeV]3426/[NeIII]3867 vs [OII]3727/[NeIII]3867 line ratios are most easily explained by radiative shock models with precursor photoionisation. Hence, we infer that the line emission is directly caused by the shocks from the jet and that this radio source is one of the youngest and most powerful known at cosmic noon. We speculate that the star-formation in GLEAM J0917-0012 could be on its way to becoming quenched by the jet.</description>

      <title>The effect of helium reionization on the Lyman-alpha forest hydrogen flux statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the impact of QSOs on the high redshift (z &gt; 4) Intergalactic Medium using Monte Carlo realisations of QSO populations and the HeIII regions they generate, applied to the Sherwood-Relics simulations, allowing for uncertainties in the QSO luminosity function, its evolution, and QSO spectra and ages. While QSO luminosity functions based on optical-infrared selection are unable to reproduce the broadening HI Lyman-alpha optical depth distributions at z &gt; 5, much broader distributions are found for the higher numbers of QSOs based on x-ray selection, suggesting a large QSO contribution to the ultra-violet background at z &gt; 5 may offer an alternative to late reionization models to account for the broad HI Lyman-alpha optical depth distributions. Realisations using QSOs based on the higher QSO counts also much better recover the measured pixel flux auto-correlation function at z &gt; 5. The HeIII regions from QSO sources according to both types of luminosity function suppress the pixel flux power spectrum on small scales, k &gt; 0.02 s/km, while enhancing it on larger, both by amounts of up to tens of percent at z &gt; 4, with the magnitude increasing with the intergalactic HeIII filling factor and the boost in temperature within the HeIII regions.</description>

      <title>Boosting HI-Galaxy Cross-Clustering Signal through Higher-Order Cross-Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After reionization, neutral hydrogen (HI) traces the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, enabling HI intensity mapping (IM) to capture the LSS in 3D and constrain key cosmological parameters. We present a new framework utilizing higher-order cross-correlations to study HI clustering around galaxies, tested using real-space data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation. This approach computes the joint distributions of $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) optical galaxies and the HI brightness temperature field smoothed at relevant scales (the $k$NN-field framework), providing sensitivity to all higher-order cross-correlations, unlike two-point statistics. To simulate HI data from actual surveys, we add random thermal noise and apply a simple foreground cleaning model, filtering out Fourier modes of the brightness temperature field with $k_\parallel &lt; k_{\rm min,\parallel}$. Under current levels of thermal noise and foreground cleaning, typical of a Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)-like survey, the HI-galaxy cross-correlation signal in our simulations, using the $k$NN-field framework, is detectable at $&gt;30\sigma$ across $r = [3,12] \, h^{-1}$Mpc. In contrast, the detectability of the standard two-point correlation function (2PCF) over the same scales depends strongly on the foreground filter: a sharp $k_\parallel$ filter can spuriously boost detection to $8\sigma$ due to position-space ringing, whereas a less sharp filter yields no detection. Nonetheless, we conclude that $k$NN-field cross-correlations are robustly detectable across a broad range of foreground filtering and thermal noise conditions, suggesting their potential for enhanced constraining power over 2PCFs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological tests of quintessence in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a suite of the most recent cosmological observations to test models of dynamical dark energy motivated by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus on hilltop quintessence scenarios, able to satisfy theoretical constraints from quantum gravity. We discuss their realisation based on axions, their supersymmetric partners, and Higgs-like string constructions. We also examine a specific parameterisation for dynamical dark energy suitable for hilltop quintessence. We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data. We show to what extent current data can distinguish amongst different hilltop set-ups, providing model parameter constraints that are complementary to and synergetic with theoretical bounds from quantum gravity conjectures, as well as model comparisons across the main dark energy candidates in the literature. However, all these constraints are sensitive to priors based on theoretical assumptions about viable regions of parameter space. Consequently, we discuss theoretical challenges in refining these priors, with the aim of maximizing the informative power of current and forthcoming cosmological datasets for testing dark energy scenarios in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmology with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich maps: Minkowski functionals, peaks, minima, and moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ) is a sensitive probe of cosmology, as it traces the abundance of galaxy clusters and groups in the late-time Universe. Upcoming cosmic microwave background experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 will provide low-noise and high-resolution component-separated tSZ maps covering a large sky fraction. The tSZ signal is highly non-Gaussian; therefore, higher-order statistics are needed to optimally extract information from these maps. In this work, we study the cosmological constraining power of several tSZ statistics -- Minkowski functionals (MFs), peaks, minima, and moments -- that have yielded promising results in capturing non-Gaussian information from other cosmological data. Using a large suite of halo-model-based tSZ simulations with varying $\Omega_{c}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ (154 cosmologies and over $800, 000$ maps, each $10.5\times10.5$ deg$^{2}$), we show that by combining these observables, we can achieve $\approx 29\times$ tighter constraints compared to using the tSZ power spectrum alone in an idealized noiseless case, with the MFs dominating the constraints. We show that much of the MF constraining power arises from halos below the detection threshold of cluster surveys, suggesting promising synergies with cluster-count analyses. Finally, we demonstrate that these statistics have the potential to deliver tight constraints even in the presence of noise. For example, using post-component-separation tSZ noise expected for SO, we obtain $\approx1.6\times$ and $\approx1.8\times$ tighter constraints than the power spectrum with MFs and all statistics combined, respectively. We show that the constraints from MFs approach the noiseless case for white-noise levels $\lesssim 1 \,\, \mu$K-arcmin.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions of Einstein-Aether Gravity from Barrow Agegraphic and New Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy models: Examinations and Observational Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation exploring the theoretical framework of Einstein-Aether gravity theory when combined with two novel cosmological paradigms: the Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy (BADE) and its newer variant, the New Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy (NBADE). Our study focuses on deriving the functional relationships within Einstein-Aether gravity as they emerge from these dark energy formulations. The parameter space of our theoretical models is rigorously constrained through statistical analysis employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology, utilizing multiple observational datasets, incorporating measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the combined Pantheon+SH0ES compilation. Based on our optimized parameter sets, we conduct an extensive analysis of fundamental cosmological indicators, including cosmographic parameter evolution, dark energy equation of state parameter ($\omega_{DE}$), evolution of the density parameter $\Omega(z)$, dynamical characteristics in the $\omega'_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$ space, behavior of statefinder diagnostic pairs $(r,s^*)$ and $(r,q)$, and Om(z) diagnostic trajectories. Our analysis demonstrates that the current cosmic expansion exhibits accelerated behavior, with the dark energy component manifesting quintessence-like properties in the present epoch while trending toward phantom behavior in future evolution. We additionally evaluate the viability of both BADE and NBADE frameworks through an examination of the squared sound speed ($v_s^2$) stability criterion. The cumulative evidence suggests that these models effectively characterize contemporary cosmic evolution while offering novel perspectives on dark energy phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Induced Thermal Friction on Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions of the solitonic domain walls that occur in realistic axion electrodynamics models including the Chern-Simons interaction, $a\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\sigma}$, between an axion $a(x)$ of mass $m_a$, and a massless U(1) gauge field, e.g. EM, interacting with strength $\alpha=e^2/4\pi$ with charged matter, e.g. electron-positron pairs. In particular, in the presence of a U(1) gauge-and-matter relativistic thermal plasma we study the friction experienced by the walls due to the Chern-Simons term. Utilizing the linear response method we include the collective effects of the plasma, as opposed to purely particle scattering across the wall (as is done in previous treatments) which is valid only in the thin wall regime that is rarely applicable in realistic cases. We show that the friction depends on the Lorentz-$\gamma$-factor-dependent inverse thickness of the wall in the plasma frame, $\ell^{-1} \sim \gamma m_a$, compared to the three different plasma scales, the temperature $T$, the Debye mass $m_D\sim\sqrt{\alpha} T$, and the damping rate $\Gamma \sim \alpha^2 T$, and elucidate the underlying physical intuition for this behavior. (For friction in the thin-wall-limit we correct previous expressions in the literature.) We further consider the effects of long-range coherent magnetic fields that are possibly present in the early universe and compare their effect with that of thermal magnetic fields. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible early universe consequences of our results for domain wall motion and network decay, stochastic gravitational wave production from domain wall networks, and possible primordial black hole production from domain wall collapse, though a more complete discussion of these topics is reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Lensing point-spread function of coherent astrophysical sources and non-trivial wave effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most research on astrophysical lensing has been conducted using the geometric optics framework, where there exists a clear concept of lensing images. However, wave optics effects can be important for coherent sources, e.g. pulsars, fast raio bursts, and gravitational waves observed at long wavelengths. There, the concept of lensing images needs an extension. We introduce the concept of the `lensing point-spread function' (LPSF), the smoothed flux density distribution of a coherent point source after being lensed, as a generalization of the lensing image concept at finite frequencies. The frequency-dependent LPSF captures the gradual change of the flux density distribution of the source from discrete geometric images at high frequencies to a smooth distribution at low frequencies. It complements other generalizations of lensing images, notably the imaginary images and the Lefschetz thimbles. Being a footprint of a lensing system, the LPSF is useful for theoretical studies of lensing. Using the LPSF, we identify a frequency range with non-trivial wave effects, where both geometric optics and perturbative wave optics fail, and determine this range to be $|\kappa|^{-1} \lesssim \nu \lesssim 10$, with $\kappa$ and $\nu$ being the dimensionless lens amplitude and the reduced observing frequency, respectively. Observation of LPSFs with non-trivial wave effects requires either very close-by lenses or very large observing wavelengths. The potential possibilities are the lensing of gravitational waves, the plasma lensing of Milky Way pulsars, and lensing by the solar gravitational lens.</description>

      <title>Search for exotic gravitational wave signals beyond general relativity using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves by LIGO has confirmed general relativity (GR) and sparked rapid growth in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, subtle post-Newtonian (PN) deviations observed during the analysis of high signal-to-noise ratio events from the observational runs suggest that standard waveform templates, which assume strict adherence to GR, might overlook signals from alternative theories of gravity. Incorporating these exotic signals into traditional search algorithms is computationally infeasible due to the vast template space required. This paper introduces a deep learning framework for detecting exotic GW signals, leveraging neural networks trained on GR-based templates. Through their generalization ability, neural networks learn intricate features from the data, enabling the detection of signals that deviate from GR. We present the first study evaluating the capability of deep learning to detect beyond-GR signals, including a variety of PN orders. Our model achieves rapid and accurate identification of exotic GW signals across different luminosity distances, with performance comparable to GR-based detections. Applying the model to the GW150914 event demonstrates excellent performance, highlighting the potential of AI-driven methods for detecting previously overlooked signals beyond GR. This work paves the way for new discoveries in gravitational wave astronomy, enabling the detection of signals that might escape traditional search pipelines.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of Higgs portal for light self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can address the small-scale anomalies and previous researches focused on such a SIDM heavier than GeV, for which the self-scattering cross-section is in the quantum resonance region and has a non-trivial velocity dependence. For a SIDM lighter than GeV, the self-scattering cross-section falls within the Born region. In this work, considering the constraints from CMB, BBN and the DM relic density, we investigate the direct detection of the Higgs portal for a sub-GeV SIDM with a scalar mediator. For this end, we consider two approaches : one is the cosmic-ray accelerated dark matter (CRDM) scattering off the nucleon, the other is the electron recoil caused by the halo dark matter. We present direct detection limits for the parameter space of light SIDM and scalar mediator. We find that the detectability in either approach needs a sizable mediator-Higgs mixing angle ($\sin\theta$) which is larger than one for the CRDM approach and larger than $10^{-3}$ for the electron recoil approach. While the former case cannot be realized in the Higgs-portal light SIDM model with a scalar mediator, the latter case may also be constrained by some astrophysical observations or beam dump experiment. Anyway, even if other constraints are quite stringent, the direct detection may provide independent limits for such a sub-GeV SIDM.</description>

      <title>Sub-Eddington accreting supermassive primordial black holes explain Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundant population of compact, extremely red, and X-ray weak objects at $z\gtrsim4$, knows as ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). These objects exhibit spectral energy distributions that resemble both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and stellar population templates. However, whether dominated by AGN activity or compact star formation, the high redshifts and masses/luminosities of LRDs, coupled with their significant abundance, present potential challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we proposes a novel cosmic interpretation of this anomaly, suggesting that these LRDs are likely massive galaxies seeded by supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) came into being in the very early universe. We analyze 434 known LRDs from the 0.54 ${\rm deg}^2$ COSMOS-Web survey and test the hypothesis that they originated from SMPBHs assuming sub-Eddington accretion. According to our result, SMPBHs actually could lead to the existence of more LRDs, even at higher redshifts ($z&gt;8$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis focuses on the application of lattice techniques to study two separate topics: hadron interactions within quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and the emission of particles and gravitational waves (GWs) from cosmic string loops. The first part of the dissertation deals with the study of two- an three-particle interactions using lattice QCD simulations, complemented by the limit of large number of colors and chiral perturbation theory. In particular, this part presents results on the study of meson interactions as a function of the number of colors, three-pion interactions in chiral perturbation theory, and two- and three-particle scattering in the (1+1)-dimensional O(3) non-linear sigma model. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the dynamics and decay into particles and GWs of cosmic string loops, using classical-field-theory lattice computations. Results are presented for both global and local string loops.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{StreamSculptor}$: Hamiltonian Perturbation Theory for Stellar Streams in Flexible Potentials with Differentiable Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams retain a memory of their gravitational interactions with small-scale perturbations. While perturbative models for streams have been formulated in action-angle coordinates, a direct transformation to these coordinates is only available for static and typically axisymmetric models for the galaxy. The real Milky Way potential is in a state of disequilibrium, complicating the application of perturbative methods around an equilibrium system. Here, we utilize a combination of differentiable simulations and Hamiltonian perturbation theory to model the leading-order effect of dark matter subhalos on stream observables. To obtain a perturbative description of streams, we develop a direct and efficient forward mode differentiation of Hamilton's equations of motion. Our model operates in observable coordinates, allowing us to treat the effects of arbitrary subhalo potentials on streams perturbatively, while simultaneously capturing non-linear effects due to other substructures like the infalling LMC or the rotating bar. The model predicts the velocity dispersion of streams as a function of subhalo statistics, allowing us to constrain the low-mass range of subhalos down to $\sim 10^5~M_\odot$. We forecast the velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream, and find that observations are in agreement with a CDM subhalo population, with a slight preference for more dense subhalos. The method provides a new approach to characterize streams in the presence of substructure, with significantly more modeling flexibility compared to previous works.</description>

      <title>Back to the phase space: thermal axion dark radiation via couplings to standard model fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological consequences of axion interactions with standard model fermions accurately and precisely. Our analysis is entirely based on a phase space framework that allows us to keep track of the axion distribution in momentum space across the entire expansion history. First, we consider flavor-diagonal couplings to charged leptons and quantify the expected amount of dark radiation as a function of the coupling strength. Leptophilic axions are immune from complications due to strong interactions and our predictions do not suffer from theoretical uncertainties. We then focus on flavor-diagonal interactions with the three heavier quarks whose masses are all above the scale where strong interactions become non-perturbative. The top quark case is rather safe because its mass is orders of magnitude above the confinement scale, and the consequent predictions are solid. The bottom and charm masses are in more dangerous territory because they are very close to the QCD crossover. We present a comprehensive discussion of theoretical uncertainties due to both the choice of the scale where we stop the Boltzmann evolution and the running of QCD parameters. Finally, we compute the predicted amount of dark radiation expressed as an effective number of additional neutrino species. We compare our predictions with the ones obtained via standard approximate procedures, and we find that adopting a rigorous phase space framework alters the prediction by an amount larger than the sensitivity of future CMB observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We question the existence of one-loop corrections to the large-scale power spectrum from small-scale modes in non-slow-roll dynamics which are not volume suppressed by the ratio of the short to long distance scales. One-loop contributions proportional to the long wavelength tree-level power spectrum, and not sharing this suppression, have appeared in studies involving interactions singled out by the non-slow-roll dynamics. In this context, we show the relevance of seemingly irrelevant interactions terms, such as the one provided by total derivative terms (boundary terms), and how they equally lead to non-volume suppressed contributions and exact cancellations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the $A_L$ Lensing Anomaly in Planck 2018 Temperature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the lensing anomaly in the Planck 2018 temperature (TT) data and examine its robustness to frequency selection and additional sky masking. Our main findings are: (1) The phenomenological lensing amplitude parameter, $A_L$, varies with ecliptic latitude, with a $2.9\sigma$ preference for $A_L&gt;1$ near the ecliptic, and $1.0\sigma$ preference near the ecliptic poles, compared to $2.5\sigma$ on the original masks. This behavior is largely or solely from 217 GHz and suggestive of some non-random effect given the Planck scan strategy. (2) The 217 GHz TT data also show a stronger preference for $A_L&gt;1$ than the lower frequencies. The shifts in $A_L$ from 217 GHz with additional Galactic dust masking are too large to be explained solely by statistical fluctuations, indicating some connection with the foreground treatment. Overall, the Planck $A_L$ anomaly does not have a single simple cause. Removing the 217 GHz TT data leaves a $1.8\sigma$ preference for $A_L&gt;1$. The low-multipole ($\ell&lt;30$) TT data contribute to the preference for $A_L&gt;1$ through correlations with $\Lambda$CDM parameters. The 100 and 143 GHz data at $\ell\geq30$ prefer $A_L&gt;1$ at $1.3\sigma$, and this appears robust to the masking tests we performed. The lensing anomaly may impact fits to alternative cosmological models. Marginalizing over $A_L$, optionally applied only to Planck TT spectra, can check this. Models proposed to address cosmological tensions should be robust to removal of the Planck 217 GHz TT data.</description>

      <title>On the interacting dark energy scenarios $-$ the case for Hubble constant tension</title>

Abstract: The Hubble constant $H_0$ is one of the important cosmological parameters measuring the expansion rate of our universe at present moment. Over the last couple of years, $H_0$ has created an enormous amount of debates interests in the astrophysical and cosmological communities for its different estimations at many standard deviations by different observational surveys. The recent estimation of $H_0$ from the cosmic microwave background observations by Planck within the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm is in tension with $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ confidence with SH0ES (Supernovae and $H_0$ for the Equation of State of dark energy) collaboration. As a result, revision of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has been suggested in various ways in order to examine whether such scenarios can solve this $H_0$ tension. Among the list of the proposed cosmological scenarios, in this chapter we focus on a generalized cosmological theory in which the dark components of the universe, namely, Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) are allowed to interact with each other in a non-gravitational way, widely known as the Interacting DE or Coupled DE scenarios. These interacting scenarios have received magnificent attention in the scientific community for their appealing consequences. Specifically, in the context of $H_0$ tension, it has been observed that the interacting DE scenarios can lead to higher values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) value, and consequently, the tension on $H_0$ can be either alleviated or solved. In this chapter we review various interacting DE scenarios and their roles in alleviating the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the variance of individual halo properties in constrained cosmological simulations</title>

Abstract: Constrained cosmological simulations play an important role in modelling the local Universe, enabling investigation of the dark matter content of local structures and their formation. We introduce an internal method for quantifying the extent to which the variance of individual halo properties is suppressed by the constraints imposed on the initial conditions. We apply it to the Constrained Simulations in BORG (CSiBORG) suite of $101$ high-resolution realisations across the posterior probability distribution of initial conditions from the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. The method is based on the overlap of the initial Lagrangian patch of a halo in one simulation with those in another, measuring the degree to which the haloes' particles are initially coincident. This addresses the extent to which the imposed large-scale structure constraints reduce the variance of individual halo properties. We find consistent reconstructions of $M\gtrsim10^{14}~M_\odot / h$ haloes, indicating that the constraints from the BORG algorithm are sufficient to pin down the masses, positions, and peculiar velocities of clusters to high precision, though we do not assess how well they reproduce observations of the local Universe. The effect of the constraints tapers off towards lower mass, and the halo spins and concentrations are largely unconstrained at all masses. We document the advantages of evaluating halo consistency in the initial conditions and describe how the method may be used to quantify our knowledge of the halo field given galaxy survey data analysed through the lens of probabilistic inference machines such as BORG.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with shear ratios: a joint study of weak lensing and spectroscopic redshift datasets</title>

Abstract: The ratio of the average tangential shear signal of different weak lensing source populations around the same lens galaxies, also known as a shear ratio, provides an important test of lensing systematics and a potential source of cosmological information. In this paper we measure shear ratios in three current weak lensing surveys -- KiDS, DES, and HSC -- using overlapping data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We apply a Bayesian method to reduce bias in shear ratio measurement, and assess the degree to which shear ratio information improves the determination of important astrophysical parameters describing the source redshift distributions and intrinsic galaxy alignments, as well as cosmological parameters, in comparison with cosmic shear and full 3x2-pt correlations (cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering). We consider both Fisher matrix forecasts, as well as full likelihood analyses of the data. We find that the addition of shear ratio information to cosmic shear allows the mean redshifts of the source samples and intrinsic alignment parameters to be determined significantly more accurately. Although the additional constraining power enabled by the shear ratio is less than that obtained by introducing an accurate prior in the mean source redshift using photometric redshift calibration, the shear ratio allows for a useful cross-check. The inclusion of shear ratio data consistently benefits the determination of cosmological parameters such as S_8, for which we obtain improvements up to 34%. However these improvements are less significant when shear ratio is combined with the full 3x2-pt correlations. We conclude that shear ratio tests will remain a useful source of cosmological information and cross-checks for lensing systematics, whose application will be further enhanced by upcoming datasets such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>Exact Modeling of Power Spectrum Multipole through Spherical Fourier-Bessel Basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum is a powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity and additional general relativistic effects, which become important on large scales. At the same time, wide-angle (WA) effects due to differing lines-of-sight (LOS) on the curved sky also become important with large angular separation. In this work, we accurately model WA and Doppler effects using the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) formalism, before transforming the result into the commonly used power spectrum multipoles (PSM). This mapping from the SFB power spectrum to PSM represents a new way to non-perturbatively model WA and GR effects present in the PSM, which we validate with log-normal mocks. Moreover, for the first time, we can compute the analytical PSM Gaussian covariance on large scales, exactly including WA-induced mode-couplings, without resorting to any plane-parallel approximations.</description>

      <title>Living at the Edge: A Critical Look at the Cosmological Neutrino Mass Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological neutrino mass bounds are becoming increasingly stringent. The latest limit within $\Lambda$CDM from Planck 2018+ACT lensing+DESI is $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072\,{\rm eV}$ at 95\% CL, very close to the minimum possible sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu &gt; 0.06\,{\rm eV}$), hinting at vanishing or even ``negative'' cosmological neutrino masses. In this context, it is urgent to carefully evaluate the origin of these cosmological constraints. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of these results in three ways: i) we check the role of potential anomalies in Planck CMB and DESI BAO data; ii) we compare the results for frequentist and Bayesian techniques, as very close to physical boundaries subtleties in the derivation and interpretation of constraints can arise; iii) we investigate how deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, potentially alleviating these anomalies, can alter the constraints. From a profile likelihood analysis, we derive constraints in agreement at the $\sim 10\%$ level with Bayesian posteriors. We find that the weak preference for negative neutrino masses is mostly present for Planck 18 data, affected by the well-known `lensing anomaly'. It disappears when the new Planck 2020 HiLLiPoP is used, leading to significantly weaker constraints. Additionally, the pull towards negative masses in DESI data stems from the $z=0.7$ bin, which contains a BAO measurement in $\sim 3\sigma$ tension with Planck expectations. Without this bin, and in combination with HiLLiPoP, the bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.11\,{\rm eV}$ at 95\% CL. The recent preference for dynamical dark energy alleviates this tension and further weakens the bound. As we are at the dawn of a neutrino mass discovery from cosmology, it will be very exciting to see if this trend is confirmed by future data.</description>

      <title>Accurately Estimating Redshifts from CSST Slitless Spectroscopic Survey using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) has the capability to conduct slitless spectroscopic survey simultaneously with photometric survey. The spectroscopic survey will measure slitless spectra, potentially providing more accurate estimations of galaxy properties, particularly redshifts, compared to using broadband photometry. CSST relies on these accurate redshifts to perform baryon acoustic oscilliation (BAO) and other probes to constrain the cosmological parameters. However, due to low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of slitless spectra, measurement of redshifts is significantly challenging.} In this study, we employ a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to assess the accuracy of redshift estimations from slitless spectra anticipated to be observed by CSST. The simulation of slitless spectra is based on real observational data from the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI-EDR) and the 16th data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS-DR16), combined with the 9th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey (DESI LS DR9). The BNN is constructed employing transfer learning technique, by appending two Bayesian layers after a convolutional neural network (CNN), leveraging the features learned from the slitless spectra and corresponding redshifts. Our network can provide redshift estimates along with corresponding uncertainties, achieving an accuracy of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} = 0.00063$, outlier percentage $\eta=0.92\%$ and weighted mean uncertainty $\bar{E} = 0.00228$. These results successfully fulfill the requirement of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} &lt; 0.005$ for BAO and other studies employing CSST slitless spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>High-redshift Cosmology by Gamma-Ray Bursts: an overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several correlations among Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) quantities, both in the prompt and afterglow emissions, have been established during the last decades, thus enabling the standardization of GRBs as cosmological probes. Since GRBs are observed up to redshift $z \sim 9$, they represent a valuable tool to fill in the gap of information on the Universe evolution between the farthest type Ia supernovae and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and to shed new light on the current challenging cosmological tensions. Without claiming for completeness, here we describe the state of the art of GRB correlations, their theoretical interpretations, and their cosmological applications both as standalone probes and in combination with other probes. In this framework, we pinpoint the importance of correcting the correlations for selection biases and redshift evolution to derive intrinsic relations, the assets of combining probes at different scales, and the need for the employment of the appropriate cosmological likelihood to precisely constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of the cosmographic approach to avoid any cosmological assumptions and the valuable applications of machine learning techniques to reconstruct GRB light curves and predict unknown GRB redshifts. Finally, we stress the relevance of all these factors, along with future observations, to definitely boost the power of GRBs in cosmology.</description>

      <title>JWST Validates HST Distance Measurements: Selection of Supernova Subsample Explains Differences in JWST Estimates of Local H0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST provides new opportunities to cross-check the HST Cepheid/SNeIa distance ladder, which yields the most precise local measure of H0. We analyze early JWST subsamples (~1/4 of the HST sample) from the SH0ES and CCHP groups, calibrated by a single anchor (N4258). We find HST Cepheid distances agree well (~1 sigma) with all 8 combinations of methods, samples, and telescopes: JWST Cepheids, TRGB, and JAGB by either group, plus HST TRGB and Miras. The comparisons explicitly include the measurement uncertainty of each method in N4258, an oft-neglected but dominant term. Mean differences are ~0.03 mag, far smaller than the 0.18 mag "Hubble tension." Combining all measures produces the strongest constraint yet on the linearity of HST Cepheid distances, 0.994+-0.010, ruling out distance-dependent bias or offset as the source of the tension at ~7 sigma. Yet, measurements of H0 from current JWST subsamples produce large sampling differences whose size and direction we can directly estimate from the full HST set. We show that Delta(H0)~2.5 km/s/Mpc between the CCHP JWST program and the full HST sample is entirely consistent with differences in sample selection. Combining all JWST samples produces a new, distance-limited set of 16 SNeIa at D&lt;25 Mpc and more closely resembles the full sample thanks to "reversion to the mean" of larger samples. Using JWST Cepheids, JAGB, and TRGB, we find 73.4+-2.1, 72.2+-2.2, and 72.1+-2.2 km/s/Mpc, respectively. Explicitly accounting for SNe in common, the combined-sample three-method result from JWST is H0=72.6+-2.0, similar to H0=72.8 expected from HST Cepheids in the same galaxies. The small JWST sample trivially lowers the Hubble tension significance due to small-sample statistics and is not yet competitive with the HST set (42 SNeIa and 4 anchors), which yields 73.2+-0.9. Still, the joint JWST sample provides important crosschecks which the HST data passes.</description>

      <title>Dissipative $\Lambda$CDM model with causal sign-switching bulk viscous pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by considering dissipative effects within a causal viscous framework, and obtaining an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter remains a challenge in the literature. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by deriving a complete and original solution for the Hubble parameter by introducing a novel form for the bulk viscous coefficient associated with bulk viscous dark matter (vDM). A thorough analysis of the model is conducted by deriving theoretical constraints on the parameters and comparing the model with the latest observational data sets. Intriguingly, we find that the model predicts a sign-switching bulk viscous pressure, which facilitates both the early decelerated expansion and the late accelerated expansion of the universe. Also, the redshift at which the viscous pressure switches sign is found to be strongly correlated with the relaxation time parameter of the viscous fluid. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that, the model satisfies both the covariant and generalized second law of thermodynamics as well as the convexity condition for entropy. Additionally, we reconstructed the model by unifying viscous dark matter and dark energy into a single unified dark matter (UDM) component, and found that this unified model predicts identical dynamical evolution for the Universe, while satisfying the necessary near-equilibrium condition throughout that evolution (both in early and late phases).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the spatial curvature ($\Omega_k$) independent of cosmic microwave background observations plays a key role in revealing the physics of the early universe. The Hubble tension is one of the most serious issues in modern cosmology. We investigate halo catalogs identified from $N$-body simulations at $z=2$ and 3, mimicking high-redshift galaxy surveys. We measure redshift-space correlation functions of halos from the two snapshots. We detect clear features of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions. We find that we can obtain a few percent constraints on both the geometric distances and growth of structure at the distant universe in future surveys. By taking into account the information of the underlying matter power spectrum, we demonstrate that we can also achieve constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ with a few percent as well as the spatial curvature with $|\Omega_k|\lesssim 0.1$ by observing galaxies with the number density with $\bar{n}_{\rm g}\simeq 10^{-4} (~h^3{\rm ~Mpc}^{-3})$. Our analysis provides a timely forecast for the upcoming spectroscopic surveys, which target emission line galaxy or dusty star-forming galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>Spectral energy distribution of radiation from star-like sources in the expanding Universe and once more about Olbers' paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of the expansion of the Universe on the formation of total spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium. Assuming the same proper thermal spectrum of sources, we show how the expansion of the Universe changes the nature of the energy distribution of the thermal spectrum: a decrease of the energy density in the Wien range and an increase in the Rayleigh--Jeans range with increasing the redshift of the bulk filled by sources. This is due to the cosmological redshift and the growing contribution of large number of distant sources. The numerical estimations also illustrate the main factors that resolve the Olbers' paradox in the expanding Universe: i) the particle horizon, ii) the finiteness of the volume filled by luminous objects, and iii) the cosmological redshift. Applying the obtained expressions to the epoch of reionization made it possible to estimate the concentration of objects of various classes (stars, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies) necessary for complete reionization of hydrogen at $z=6$. It is shown that even a small part of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies with a thermal spectrum of moderate temperature, from those predicted by Press-Schechter formalism and its improvements, is able to completely reionize hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at $z=6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a custom-made calibrator to measure individual detectors' polarization angles of BICEP3, a small aperture telescope observing the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 95GHz from the South Pole. We describe our calibration strategy and the statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement. We reach an unprecedented precision for such measurement on a CMB experiment, with a repeatability for each detector pair of $0.02\deg$. We show that the relative angles measured using this method are in excellent agreement with those extracted from CMB data. Because the absolute measurement is currently limited by a systematic uncertainty, we do not derive cosmic birefringence constraints from BICEP3 data in this work. Rather, we forecast the sensitivity of BICEP3 sky maps for such analysis. We investigate the relative contributions of instrument noise, lensing, and dust, as well as astrophysical and instrumental systematics. We also explore the constraining power of different angle estimators, depending on analysis choices. We establish that the BICEP3 2-year dataset (2017--2018) has an on-sky sensitivity to the cosmic birefringence angle of $\sigma = 0.078\deg$, which could be improved to $\sigma = 0.055\deg$ by adding all of the existing BICEP3 data (through 2023). Furthermore, we emphasize the possibility of using the BICEP3 sky patch as a polarization calibration source for CMB experiments, which with the present data could reach a precision of $0.035\deg$. Finally, in the context of inflation searches, we investigate the impact of detector-to-detector variations in polarization angles as they may bias the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. We show that while the effect is expected to remain subdominant to other sources of systematic uncertainty, it can be reliably calibrated using polarization angle measurements such as the ones we present in this paper.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dynamical Friction on the Tidal Formation of NGC 1052-DF2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of dark matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs) through tidal interactions has been a subject of growing interest, particularly with the discovery of galaxies such as NGC 1052-DF2. Previous studies suggested that strong tidal forces could strip dark matter from satellite galaxies, but the role of dynamical friction in this process has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we present self-consistent N-body simulations that incorporate the effects of dynamical friction on the tidal formation of DF2, and compare them with the one without dynamical friction. We find that dynamical friction significantly accelerates the decay of the satellite galaxy's orbit, causing it to experience more frequent tidal stripping and leading to the earlier formation of a DM-deficient state, approximately 7-8 Gyr after infall. This is a few Gyr earlier than simulations without dynamical friction. Our results suggest that DMDGs can form in a wider range of orbital configurations, particularly on more circular orbits, than previously thought. Furthermore, we find that globular clusters in the DM-deficient phase exhibit elevated velocity dispersion, providing an observational signature of this evolutionary stage. We also examine the evolution of satellite in the phase space of total energy versus angular momentum, and show that a vertically narrow feature in this phase space is a clear signature of pericentre passage. These findings broaden the understanding of how DMDGs form and highlight the critical role of dynamical friction in shaping the evolutionary history of satellite galaxies in massive halos.</description>

      <title>Towards Systematic Evaluation of de Sitter Correlators via Generalized Integration-By-Parts Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00129v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Integration-By-Parts (IBP) and differential equations methods to de Sitter correlators related to inflation. While massive correlators in de Sitter spacetime are usually regarded as highly intricate, we find they have remarkably hidden concise structures from the perspective of IBP. We find the factorization of the IBP relations of each vertex integral family corresponding to $\mathrm{d} \tau_i$ integration. Furthermore, with a smart construction of master integrals, the universal formulas for iterative reduction and $\mathrm{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary vertex integral family are presented and proved. These formulas dominate all tree-level de Sitter correlators and play a kernel role at the loop-level as well.</description>

      <title>Limits on scalar dark matter interactions with particles other than the photon via loop corrections to the scalar-photon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is limited information about the interaction strength of a scalar dark matter candidate with hadrons and leptons for a scalar particle mass exceeding $10^{-3}$ eV while its interaction with photon is well studied. The scalar-photon coupling constant receives quantum corrections from one-loop Feynman diagrams which involve the scalar-lepton, scalar-quark, and scalar-W boson vertices. We calculate these one-loop quantum corrections and find new limits on the scalar particle interactions with electron, muon, tau, quarks, nucleons, gluons, Higgs, and W bosons by re-purposing the results of experiments measuring the scalar-photon interaction. Limits on interactions of heavy leptons and quarks have been obtained for the first time, and limits on other interactions in certain mass intervals are 2 to 15 orders of magnitude stronger than those presented in previous publications and exclude the resolution of the muon $g-2$ anomaly with scalar particle.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Acceleration of SN Ia Photometric Distance Estimation with BayeSN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standarizable candles whose observed light curves can be used to infer their distances, which can in turn be used in cosmological analyses. As the quantity of observed SNe Ia grows with current and upcoming surveys, increasingly scalable analyses are necessary to take full advantage of these new datasets for precise estimation of cosmological parameters. Bayesian inference methods enable fitting SN Ia light curves with robust uncertainty quantification, but traditional posterior sampling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is computationally expensive. We present an implementation of variational inference (VI) to accelerate the fitting of SN Ia light curves using the BayeSN hierarchical Bayesian model for time-varying SN Ia spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We demonstrate and evaluate its performance on both simulated light curves and data from the Foundation Supernova Survey with two different forms of surrogate posterior -- a multivariate normal and a custom multivariate zero-lower-truncated normal distribution -- and compare them with the Laplace Approximation and full MCMC analysis. To validate of our variational approximation, we calculate the pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) diagnostic, and perform variational simulation-based calibration (VSBC). The VI approximation achieves similar results to MCMC but with an order-of-magnitude speedup for the inference of the photometric distance moduli. Overall, we show that VI is a promising method for scalable parameter inference that enables analysis of larger datasets for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bell Tests with Decoherence Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window around 5 e-folds for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

      <title>Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicate a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background (CMB), weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.</description>
