      <title>Stable Rationality and Cyclicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two outstanding questions about division algebras of prime degree $p$. The first is whether they are cyclic, or equivalently crossed products. The second is whether the center, $Z(F,p)$, of the generic division algebra $UD(F,p)$ is stably rational over $F$. When $F$ is characteristic 0 and contains a primitive $p$ root of one, we show that there is a connection between these two questions. Namely, we show that if $Z(F,p)$ is not stably rational then $UD(F,p)$ is not cyclic.</description>

      <title>Levels of cancellation for monoids and modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levels of cancellativity in commutative monoids $M$, determined by stable rank values in $\mathbb{Z}_{&gt; 0} \cup \{\infty\}$ for elements of $M$, are investigated. The behavior of the stable ranks of multiples $ka$, for $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt; 0}$ and $a \in M$, is determined. In the case of a refinement monoid $M$, the possible stable rank values in archimedean components of $M$ are pinned down. Finally, stable rank in monoids built from isomorphism or other equivalence classes of modules over a ring is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the dual notion of projective modules over trusses, injective modules over trusses are introduced. The Schanuel Lemmas on projective and injective modules over trusses are exhibited in this paper.</description>

      <title>Differential graded orders, their class groups and id\`eles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Dedekind domain $R$ with field of fractions $K$ a classical $R$-order in a semisimple $K$-algebra $A$ is an $R$-projective $R$-subalgebra $\Lambda$ of $A$ such that $K\Lambda=A$. We study differential graded $K$-algebras which are semisimple as $K$-algebras and define differential graded $R$-orders as a differential graded $R$-subalgebras, which are in addition classical $R$-orders in $A$. We give a series of examples for such differential graded algebras and orders. We show that any differential graded $R$-order is contained in a maximal differential graded order. We develop parts of the classical ring theory in the differential graded setting, in particular the properties of analogues of the Jacobson radical. We further define class groups of differential graded orders as subgroups of the Grothendieck group of locally free differential graded modules. We define id\`eles in this setting showing that these id\`ele groups maps surjectively to the differential graded class group. Finally we give a homomorphism to the class group of the homology of the differential graded order and prove a Mayer-Vietoris like sequence for each central idempotent of $A$, including the analogous one for the kernel groups of these morphisms.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of the Fomin-Kirillov algebra and related algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.04597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1999, Fomin-Kirillov introduced the quadratic algebras $\mathcal{E}_m$ in terms of generators and relations which are the universal quadratic cover of the algebra generated by divided difference operators $\partial_{ij}$ acting on the polynomial ring $\mathbf{k}[x_1,\ldots,x_m]$. These algebras are mostly important due to their relations to Schubert calculus and geometry and to the general framework of quantum groups and Nichols algebras. Fomin and Kirillov asked about the dimension of $\mathcal{E}_m$. In this paper, we prove that $\mathcal{E}_m$ is infinite dimensional for all $m\geq 6$ which was a well-known conjecture. The techniques we use rely on braided differential calculus as developed by Liu and Bazlov as well as on the notion of integrals for Hopf algebras as introduced by Sweedler.</description>

      <title>Enriched duality in double categories II: modules and comodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we continue the investigation of certain enrichments of dual algebraic structures in monoidal double categories, that was initiated in [Vas19]. First, we re-visit monads and comonads in double categories and establish a tensored and cotensored enrichment of the former in the latter, under general conditions. These include monoidal closedness and local presentability of the double category, notions that are proposed as tools required for our main results, but are of interest in their own right. The natural next step involves categories of the newly introduced modules for monads and comodules for comonads in double categories. After we study their main categorical properties, we establish a tensored and cotensored enrichment of modules in comodules, as well as an enriched fibration structure that involves (co)modules over (co)monads in double categories. Applying this abstract double categorical framework to the setting of V-matrices produces an enrichment of the category of V-enriched modules (fibred over V-categories) in V-enriched comodules (opfibred over V-cocategories), which is the many-object generalization of the respective result for modules (over algebras) and comodules (over coalgebras) in monoidal categories.</description>
