      <title>Anyone for chess? Analysing chess ratings above high thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose some cleverness score parameter is sufficiently
  interesting to be defined and then measured, perhaps for
  different strata of specialists or for the broader population.
  Such phenomena could have Gaussian distributions,
  when it comes to all players in a stratum, but when interest
  focuses on the very tails, for the top few percent,
  those above certain high thresholds,
  different models are called for, along with the need
  to analyse such based on the listed top scores only.
  In this note I develop such models and tools,
  and apply them to the top-100 and above 2100 points
  lists for regular chess ratings, for the currently active
  14671 men and 753 women,
  as given by the FIDE, January 2026.
  It is argued that even when two or more distributions have
  close to identical expected values, or medians,
  even smaller differences in variance may explain gaps
  for the few very best ones.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Attention across Automated and Manual Driving Modes: A Driving Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to explore the dynamics of driver attention to various zones, including the road, the central mirror, the embedded Human-Machine Interface (HMI), and the speedometer, across different driving modes in AVs. The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems has introduced critical safety concerns, particularly regarding driver re-engagement during mode transitions. Past accidents underscore the risks of overreliance on automation and highlight the need to understand dynamic attention allocation to support safety in autonomous driving. A high-fidelity driving simulation was conducted. Eye-tracking technology was used to measure fixation duration, fixation count, and time to first fixation across distinct driving modes (automated, manual, and transition), which were then used to assess how drivers allocated attention to various areas of interest (AOIs). Findings show that drivers' attention varies significantly across driving modes. In manual mode, attention consistently focuses on the road, while in automated mode, prolonged fixation on the embedded HMI was observed. During the handover and takeover phases, attention shifts dynamically between environmental and technological elements. The study reveals that driver attention allocation is mode-dependent. These findings inform the design of adaptive HMIs in AVs that align with drivers' attention patterns. By presenting relevant information according to the driving context, such systems can enhance driver-vehicle interaction, support effective transitions, and improve overall safety. Systematic analysis of visual attention dynamics across driving modes is gaining prominence, as it informs adaptive HMI designs and driver readiness interventions. The GLMM findings can be directly applied to the design of adaptive HMIs or driver training programs to enhance attention and improve safety.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in Island-based Ecosystem Services and Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small and medium-sized islands are acutely exposed to climate change and ecosystem degradation, yet the extent to which uncertainty is systematically addressed in scientific assessments of their ecosystem services remains poorly understood. This study revisits 226 peer-reviewed articles drawn from two global systematic reviews on island ecosystem services and climate change, applying a structured post hoc analysis to evaluate how uncertainty is treated across methods, service categories, ecosystem realms, and decision contexts. Studies were classified according to whether uncertainty was explicitly analysed, just mentioned, or ignored. Only 30 percent of studies incorporated uncertainty explicitly, while more than half did not address it at all. Scenario-based approaches dominated uncertainty assessment, whereas probabilistic and ensemble-based frameworks remained limited. Cultural ecosystem services and extreme climate impacts exhibited the lowest levels of uncertainty integration, and few studies connected uncertainty treatment to policy relevant decision frameworks. Weak or absent treatment of uncertainty emerges as a structural challenge in island systems, where narrow ecological thresholds, strong land-sea coupling, limited spatial buffers, and reduced institutional redundancy amplify the consequences of decision-making under incomplete knowledge. Systematic mapping of how uncertainty is framed, operationalised, or neglected reveals persistent methodological and conceptual gaps and informs concrete directions for strengthening uncertainty integration in future island-focused ecosystem service and climate assessments. Embedding uncertainty more robustly into modelling practices, participatory processes, and policy tools is essential for enhancing scientific credibility, governance relevance, and adaptive capacity in insular socio-ecological systems.</description>
