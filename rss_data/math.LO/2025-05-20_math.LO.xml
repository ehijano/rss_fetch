      <title>Theory: Multidimensional Space of Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends Bayesian probability theory by developing a multidimensional space of events (MDSE) theory that accounts for mutual influences between events and hypotheses sets. While traditional Bayesian approaches assume conditional independence between certain variables, real-world systems often exhibit complex interdependencies that limit classical model applicability. Building on established probabilistic foundations, our approach introduces a mathematical formalism for modeling these complex relationships. We developed the MDSE theory through rigorous mathematical derivation and validated it using three complementary methodologies: analytical proofs, computational simulations, and case studies drawn from diverse domains. Results demonstrate that MDSE successfully models complex dependencies with 15-20% improved prediction accuracy compared to standard Bayesian methods when applied to datasets with high interdimensionality. This theory particularly excels in scenarios with over 50 interrelated variables, where traditional methods show exponential computational complexity growth while MDSE maintains polynomial scaling. Our findings indicate that MDSE provides a viable mathematical foundation for extending Bayesian reasoning to complex systems while maintaining computational tractability. This approach offers practical applications in engineering challenges including risk assessment, resource optimization, and forecasting problems where multiple interdependent factors must be simultaneously considered.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less known-role in subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>

      <title>Interpolation for the two-way modal mu-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-way modal mu-calculus is the extension of the (standard) one-way mu-calculus with converse (backward-looking) modalities. For this logic we introduce two new sequent-style proof calculi: a non-wellfounded system admitting infinite branches and a finitary, cyclic version of this that employs annotations. As is common in sequent systems for two-way modal logics, our calculi feature an analytic cut rule. What distinguishes our approach is the use of so-called trace atoms, which serve to apply Vardi's two-way automata in a proof-theoretic setting. We prove soundness and completeness for both systems and subsequently use the cyclic calculus to show that the two-way mu-calculus has the (local) Craig interpolation property, with respect to both propositions and modalities. Our proof uses a version of Maehara's method adapted to cyclic proof systems. As a corollary we prove that the two-way mu-calculus also enjoys Beth's definability property.</description>

      <title>Domains and Classifying Topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a new connection between synthetic domain theory and Grothendieck topoi related to the distributive lattice classifier. In particular, all the axioms of synthetic domain theory (including the inductive fixed point object and the chain completeness of the dominance) emanate from a countable version of the synthetic quasi-coherence principle that has emerged as a central feature in the unification of synthetic algebraic geometry, synthetic Stone duality, and synthetic category theory. The duality between quasi-coherent algebras and affine spaces in a topos with a distributive lattice object provides a new set of techniques for reasoning synthetically about domain-like structures, and reveals a broad class of (higher) sheaf models for synthetic domain theory.</description>

      <title>The proper forcing axiom for $\aleph_1$-sized posets, $\omega_1$-linked symmetrically proper forcing, and the size of the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01395v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Proper Forcing Axiom for forcing notions of size $\aleph_1$ is consistent with the continuum being arbitrarily large. In fact, assuming $GCH$ holds and $\kappa\geq\omega_2$ is a regular cardinal, we prove that there is a proper and $\aleph_2$-c.c.\ forcing giving rise to a model of this forcing axiom together with $2^{\aleph_0}=\kappa$ and which, in addition, satisfies all statements of the form $\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)\models \exists y\varphi(a, y)$, where $a\in \mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)$ and $\varphi(x, y)$ is a $\Sigma_0$ formula with the property that for every ground model $M$ of $CH$ with $a\in M$ there is, in $M$, a suitably nice poset -- specifically, a poset $\mathbb{Q}\subseteq\mathcal{H}(\kappa)^M$ which is $\omega_1$-linked and symmetrically proper -- adding some $b$ such that $\varphi(a, b)$. In particular, $\mathbb{P}$ forces Moore's Measuring principle, Baumgartner's Axiom for $\aleph_1$-dense sets of reals, Todor\v{c}evi\'{c}'s Open Colouring Axiom for sets of size $\aleph_1$, the Abraham-Rubin-Shelah Open Colouring Axiom, and Todor\v{c}evi\'{c}'s P-ideal Dichotomy for $\aleph_1$-generated ideals on $\omega_1$, among other statements. Hence, all these statements are simultaneously compatible with a large continuum. Finally, we show that a further small variation of our construction yields a model satisfying, in addition to all the earlier conclusions, Martin's Maximum for posets of size $\aleph_1$.</description>

      <title>Epimorphisms between finitely generated algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quasivariety has the weak ES property when the epimorphisms between its finitely generated members are surjective. A characterization of quasivarieties with the weak ES property is obtained and a method for detecting failures of this property in quasivarieties with a near unanimity term and in congruence permutable varieties is given. It is also shown that under reasonable assumptions the weak ES property implies arithmeticity. In particular, every filtral variety with the weak ES property is a discriminator variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Lyndon interpolation property (LIP) and the uniform Lyndon interpolation property (ULIP) for extensions of $\mathbf{S4}$ and intermediate propositional logics. We prove that among the 18 consistent normal modal logics of finite height extending $\mathbf{S4}$ known to have CIP, 11 logics have LIP and 7 logics do not. We also prove that for intermediate propositional logics, the Craig interpolation property, LIP, and ULIP are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Approximability of deep equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a structural framework for computations involving floating-point operations.Informed by real-valued logic, we introduce deep computations (ultracomputations) and deep iterates, formalizing the ideas of "asymptotic limit" of computations and compositional iterates, respectively.
  As an application of this framework, we prove the existence of deep equilibria, which hitherto have been found only empirically (yielding remarkable memory savings in deep learning). Our proof of existence of deep equilibria is based on the concept of idempotent ultrafilter from combinatorics and inspired by the notion of indiscernibility from model theory.
  We study and characterize deep computations (and hence deep equilibria) that are bona fide computable, i.e., uniformly approximable by a priori given computable primitive real-valued functions. Informed by model theory of real-valued structures, as well as Cp-theory from topology, we use a classical result of Grothendieck to characterize computability of deep computations in terms of continuous extendibility.
  Our framework does not impose a priori uniform/global bounds on real-valued quantities; therefore, our structures yield non-compact types spaces. Such type spaces require a more nuanced topologically treatment than compact ones arising in model theory of [0,1]-valued structures.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Exponentiation in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While ordinals have traditionally been studied mostly in classical frameworks, constructive ordinal theory has seen significant progress in recent years. However, a general constructive treatment of ordinal exponentiation has thus far been missing. We present two seemingly different definitions of constructive ordinal exponentiation in the setting of homotopy type theory. The first is abstract, uses suprema of ordinals, and is solely motivated by the expected equations. The second is more concrete, based on decreasing lists, and can be seen as a constructive version of a classical construction by Sierpi\'{n}ski based on functions with finite support. We show that our two approaches are equivalent (whenever it makes sense to ask the question), and use this equivalence to prove algebraic laws and decidability properties of the exponential. All our results are formalized in the proof assistant Agda.</description>
