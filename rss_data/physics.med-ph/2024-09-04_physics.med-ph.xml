      <title>Annular x-ray optics offer superior resolution for radiation sensitive samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution x-ray microscopy requires a high photon flux to measure the signal from weakly scattering samples. This exposes samples to high radiation doses, potentially damaging or destroying them through radiation damage. In this work, we propose the use of annular optics in scanning microscopy as an alternative to full-aperture optics. Annular optics act as high-pass filters. Compared to regular optics with the same numerical aperture, annular optics expose the sample to less dose while producing the same signal from small sample features. Annular optics benefit significantly from the high photon fluxes of the latest x-ray sources to compensate for their overall smaller cross section. Using numerical simulations, we show that annular optics offer superior optical performance for sample features close to the resolution limit of the optic.</description>

      <title>Single-pulse Gy-scale irradiation of biological cells at average dose-rates above $10^{13}$ Gy/s from a laser-wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first experimental characterization of a laser-wakefield accelerator able to deliver, in a single pulse, doses in excess of 1 Gy on timescales of the order of tens of femtoseconds, reaching unprecedented average dose-rates above $10^{13}$ Gy/s. The irradiator is demonstrated to deliver doses tuneable up to 2.2 Gy in a cm$^2$ area and with a high degree of longitudinal and transverse uniformity in a single irradiation. In this regime, proof-of-principle irradiation of patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cells and human skin fibroblast cells show indications of a differential cellular response, when compared to reference irradiations at conventional dose-rates. These include a statistically significant increase in relative biological effectiveness ($1.40\pm0.08$ at 50\% survival for both cell lines) and a significant reduction of the relative radioresistance of tumour cells. Data analysis provides preliminary indications that these effects might not be fully explained by induced oxygen depletion in the cells but may be instead linked to a higher complexity of the damages triggered by the ultra-high density of ionising tracks of femtosecond-scale radiation pulses. These results demonstrate an integrated platform for systematic radiobiological studies at unprecedented beam durations and dose-rates, a unique infrastructure for translational research in radiobiology at the femtosecond scale.</description>

      <title>Prediction of excitable wave dynamics using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitable systems, including cardiac tissue, can exhibit a variety of dynamics with different complexity, ranging from a single, stable spiral to spiral defect chaos (SDC), during which spiral waves are continuously formed and destroyed. Cardiac models typically involve a large number of variables and can be time-consuming to simulate. Here we trained a deep-learning (DL) model using snapshots from a single variable, obtained by simulating a single quasi-periodic spiral wave and spiral defect chaos (SDC) using a generic cardiac model. Using the trained DL model, we predicted the dynamics in both cases, using timesteps that are much larger than required for the simulations of the underlying equations. We show that the DL model is able to predict the trajectory of a quasi-periodic spiral wave and that the SDC activaton patterns can be predicted for approximately one Lyapunov time. Furthermore, we show that the DL model accurately captures the statistics of termination events in SDC, including the mean termination time. Finally, we show that a DL model trained using a specific domain size is able to replicate termination statistics on larger domains, resulting in significant computational savings.</description>

      <title>Objective Features Extracted from Motor Activity Time Series for Food Addiction Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates machine learning algorithms to identify objective features for diagnosing food addiction (FA) and assessing confirmed symptoms (SC). Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Participants provided demographic and anthropometric data, completed the YFAS, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and wore an actimeter on the non-dominant wrist for a week to record motor activity. Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity. Our results support the concept of a human bionic suite composed of IoT devices and ML sensors, which implements health digital assistance with real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological indicators related to FA and SC.</description>

      <title>Ground-truth effects in learning-based fiber orientation distribution estimation in neonatal brains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is a non-invasive method for depicting brain microstructure in vivo. Fiber orientation distributions (FODs) are mathematical representations extensively used to map white matter fiber configurations. Recently, FOD estimation with deep neural networks has seen growing success, in particular, those of neonates estimated with fewer diffusion measurements. These methods are mostly trained on target FODs reconstructed with multi-shell multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (MSMT-CSD), which might not be the ideal ground truth for developing brains. Here, we investigate this hypothesis by training a state-of-the-art model based on the U-Net architecture on both MSMT-CSD and single-shell three-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (SS3T-CSD). Our results suggest that SS3T-CSD might be more suited for neonatal brains, given that the ratio between single and multiple fiber-estimated voxels with SS3T-CSD is more realistic compared to MSMT-CSD. Additionally, increasing the number of input gradient directions significantly improves performance with SS3T-CSD over MSMT-CSD. Finally, in an age domain-shift setting, SS3T-CSD maintains robust performance across age groups, indicating its potential for more accurate neonatal brain imaging.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the spatial resolution of PET imaging system measuring polarization-correlated Compton events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of positron emission tomography (PET) devices have shown that the detection of polarization-correlated annihilation quanta can potentially reduce the background and creation of false lines of response (LORs) leading to improved image quality. We developed a novel PET demonstrator system, capable of measuring correlated gamma photons with single-layer Compton polarimeters to explore the potential of the method. We tested the system using sources with clinically relevant activities at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. Here we present, for the first time, the images of two Ge-68 line sources, reconstructed solely from the correlated annihilation events. The spatial resolution at two different diameters is determined and compared to the one obtained from events with photoelectric interaction.</description>

      <title>Development of the normalization method for the Jagiellonian PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims at applying the theory of the component-based normalization for the Jagiellonian PET scanner, currently under development at the Jagiellonian University. In any Positron Emission Tomography acquisition, efficiency along a line-of-response can vary due to several physical and geometrical effects, leading to severe artifacts in the reconstructed image. To mitigate these effects, a normalization coefficient is applied to each line-of-response, defined as the product of several components. Specificity of the Jagiellonian PET scanner geometry is taken into account. Results obtained from GATE simulations are compared with preliminary results obtained from experimental data.</description>
