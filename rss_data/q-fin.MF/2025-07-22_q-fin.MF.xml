      <title>Optimal Decisions for Liquid Staking: Allocation and Exit Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an investor's optimal entry and exit decisions in a liquid staking protocol (LSP) and an automated market maker (AMM), primarily from the standpoint of the investor. Our analysis focuses on two key investor actions: the initial allocation decision at time t=0, and the optimal timing of exit. First, we derive an optimal allocation strategy that enables the investor to distribute risk across the LSP, AMM, and direct holding. Our results also offer insights for LSP and AMM designers, identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the investor is incentivized to stake through an LSP, and further, to provide liquidity in addition to staking. These conditions include a lower bound on the transaction fee, for which we propose a fee mechanism that attains the bound. Second, given a fixed protocol design, we model the optimal exit timing of an individual investor using Laplace transforms and free-boundary techniques. We analyze scenarios with and without transaction fees. In the absence of fees, we decompose the investor's payoff into impermanent loss and opportunity cost, and provide theoretical results characterizing the investor's payoff and the optimal exit threshold. With transaction fees, we conduct numerical analyses to examine how fee accumulation influences exit strategies. Our results reveal that in both settings, a stop-loss strategy often maximizes the investor's expected payoff, driven by opportunity gains and the accumulation of fees where fees are present. Our analyses rely on various tools from stochastic processes and control theory, as well as convex optimization and analysis. We further support our theoretical insights with numerical experiments and explore additional properties of the investor's value function and optimal behavior.</description>

      <title>On an Optimal Stopping Problem with a Discontinuous Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an optimal stopping problem with an unbounded, time-dependent and discontinuous reward function. This problem is motivated by the pricing of a variable annuity contract with guaranteed minimum maturity benefit, under the assumption that the policyholder's surrender behaviour maximizes the risk-neutral value of the contract. We consider a general fee and surrender charge function, and give a condition under which optimal stopping always occurs at maturity. Using an alternative representation for the value function of the optimization problem, we study its analytical properties and the resulting surrender (or exercise) region. In particular, we show that the non-emptiness and the shape of the surrender region are fully characterized by the fee and the surrender charge functions, which provides a powerful tool to understand their interrelation and how it affects early surrenders and the optimal surrender boundary. Under certain conditions on these two functions, we develop three representations for the value function; two are analogous to their American option counterpart, and one is new to the actuarial and American option pricing literature.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path-Dependent Volatility Models for Price-Storage Dynamics in Natural Gas Markets and Discrete-Time Swing Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the price-storage dynamics in natural gas markets. A novel stochastic path-dependent volatility model is introduced with path-dependence in both price volatility and storage increments. Model calibrations are conducted for both the price and storage dynamics. Further, we discuss the pricing problem of discrete-time swing options using the dynamic programming principle, and a deep learning-based method is proposed for numerical approximations. A numerical algorithm is provided, followed by a convergence analysis result for the deep-learning approach.</description>

      <title>Unified Asymptotics For Investment Under Illiquidity: Transaction Costs And Search Frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal investment problem in a market with two types of illiquidity: transaction costs and search frictions. Extending the framework established by arXiv:2101.09936, we analyze a power-utility maximization problem where an investor encounters proportional transaction costs and trades only when a Poisson process triggers trading opportunities. We show that the optimal trading strategy is described by a no-trade region. We introduce a novel asymptotic framework applicable when both transaction costs and search frictions are small. Using this framework, we derive explicit asymptotics for the no-trade region and the value function along a specific parametric curve. This approach unifies existing asymptotic results for models dealing exclusively with either transaction costs or search frictions.</description>

      <title>Path-dependent PDEs for volatility derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We regard options on VIX and Realised Variance as solutions to path-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in a continuous stochastic volatility model. The modeling assumption specifies that the instantaneous variance is a $C^3$ function of a multidimensional Gaussian Volterra process; this includes a large class of models suggested for the purpose of VIX option pricing, either rough, or not, or mixed. We unveil the path-dependence of those volatility derivatives and, under a regularity hypothesis on the payoff function, we prove the well-posedness of the associated PDE. The latter is of heat type, because of the Gaussian assumption, and the terminal condition is also path-dependent. Furthermore, formulae for the greeks are provided, the implied volatility is shown to satisfy a quasi-linear path-dependent PDE and, in Markovian models, finite-dimensional pricing PDEs are obtained for VIX options.</description>

      <title>Floating exercise boundaries for American options in time-inhomogeneous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models characterized by negative interest rates (for equity/FX) or negative convenience yields (for commodities/cryptocurrencies). Under such conditions, exercise boundaries may exhibit a "floating" structure - dynamically appearing and disappearing. For example, a second exercise boundary could emerge within the computational domain and subsequently both could collapse, demanding specialized pricing methodologies.</description>
