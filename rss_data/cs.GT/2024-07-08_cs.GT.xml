      <title>Algorithmic Collusion And The Minimum Price Markov Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Minimum Price Markov Game (MPMG), a dynamic variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The MPMG serves as a theoretical model and reasonable approximation of real-world first-price sealed-bid public auctions that follow the minimum price rule. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a framework to study market fairness and regulation in both digitized and non-digitized public procurement processes, amidst growing concerns about algorithmic collusion in online markets. We demonstrate, using multi-agent reinforcement learning-driven artificial agents, that algorithmic tacit coordination is difficult to achieve in the MPMG when cooperation is not explicitly engineered. Paradoxically, our results highlight the robustness of the minimum price rule in an auction environment, but also show that it is not impervious to full-scale algorithmic collusion. These findings contribute to the ongoing debates about algorithmic pricing and its implications.</description>

Abstract: The potential move from search to question answering (QA) ignited the question of how should the move from sponsored search to sponsored QA look like. We present the first formal analysis of a sponsored QA platform. The platform fuses an organic answer to a question with an ad to produce a so called {\em sponsored answer}. Advertisers then bid on their sponsored answers. Inspired by Generalized Second Price Auctions (GSPs), the QA platform selects the winning advertiser, sets the payment she pays, and shows the user the sponsored answer. We prove an array of results. For example, advertisers are incentivized to be truthful in their bids; i.e., set them to their true value of the sponsored answer. The resultant setting is stable with properties of VCG auctions.</description>

      <title>Welfare-Optimal Serial Dictatorships have Polynomial Query Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serial dictatorship is a simple mechanism for coordinating agents in solving combinatorial optimization problems according to their preferences. The most representative such problem is one-sided matching, in which a set of n agents have values for a set of n items, and the objective is to compute a matching of the agents to the items of maximum total value (a.k.a., social welfare). Following the recent framework of Caragiannis and Rathi [10], we consider a model in which the agent-item values are not available upfront but become known by querying agent sequences. In particular, when the agents are asked to act in a sequence, they respond by picking their favorite item that has not been picked by agents who acted before and reveal their value for it. Can we compute an agent sequence that induces a social welfare-optimal matching?
  We answer this question affirmatively and present an algorithm that uses polynomial number (n^5) of queries. This solves the main open problem stated by Caragiannis and Rathi [CR23]. Our analysis uses a potential function argument that measures progress towards learning the underlying edge-weight information. Furthermore, the algorithm has a truthful implementation by adapting the paradigm of VCG payments.</description>

      <title>The Degree of Fairness in Efficient House Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic house allocation problem is primarily concerned with finding a matching between a set of agents and a set of houses that guarantees some notion of economic efficiency (e.g. utilitarian welfare). While recent works have shifted focus on achieving fairness (e.g. minimizing the number of envious agents), they often come with notable costs on efficiency notions such as utilitarian or egalitarian welfare. We investigate the trade-offs between these welfare measures and several natural fairness measures that rely on the number of envious agents, the total (aggregate) envy of all agents, and maximum total envy of an agent. In particular, by focusing on envy-free allocations, we first show that, should one exist, finding an envy-free allocation with maximum utilitarian or egalitarian welfare is computationally tractable. We highlight a rather stark contrast between utilitarian and egalitarian welfare by showing that finding utilitarian welfare maximizing allocations that minimize the aforementioned fairness measures can be done in polynomial time while their egalitarian counterparts remain intractable (for the most part) even under binary valuations. We complement our theoretical findings by giving insights into the relationship between the different fairness measures and conducting empirical analysis.</description>

Abstract: Prior research has explored potential applications of video games in programming education to elicit computational thinking skills. However, existing approaches are often either too general, not taking into account the diversity of genres and mechanisms between video games, or too narrow, selecting tools that were specifically designed for educational purposes. In this paper we propose a more fundamental approach, defining beneficial connections between individual design patterns present in video games and computational thinking skills. We argue that video games have the capacity to elicit these skills and even to potentially train them. This could be an effective method to solidify a conceptual base which would make programming education more effective.</description>

      <title>How to Evaluate Games in Education: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adding game elements to higher education is an increasingly common practice. As a result, many recent empirical studies focus on studying the effectiveness of gamified or game-based educational experiences. The findings of these studies are very diverse, showing both positive and negative effects, and thus calling for comparative meta-studies. In this paper we review and analyze different studies, aiming to summarise and evaluate controlled experiments conducted within different scientific disciplines. We focus on the clarity of non-experimental conditions' descriptions and show that in most cases a. educational methods used in control groups' activities are poorly described, b. educational materials used in control groups' activities are often unclear, and c. the starting conditions are unclear. We also noticed that studies in the fields of computer science and engineering, in general, report results more clearly than in other fields. Based on the above finding, we conclude with a few recommendations for the execution of future empirical studies of games in education for the sake of allowing a more structured comparison.</description>

      <title>Fair Repetitive Interval Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fair resource allocation is undoubtedly a crucial factor in customer satisfaction in several scheduling scenarios. This is especially apparent in repetitive scheduling models where the same set of clients repeatedly submits jobs on a daily basis. In this paper, we aim to analyze a repetitive scheduling system involving a set of $n$ clients and a set of $m$ days. On every day, each client submits a request to process a job exactly within a specific time interval, which may vary from day to day, modeling the scenario where the scheduling is done Just-In-Time (JIT). The daily schedule is executed on a single machine that can process a single job at a time, therefore it is not possible to schedule jobs with intersecting time intervals. Accordingly, a feasible solution corresponds to sets of jobs with disjoint time intervals, one set per day. We define the quality of service (QoS) that a client receives as the number of executed jobs over the $m$ days period. Our objective is to provide a feasible solution where each client has at least $k$ days where his jobs are processed. We prove that this problem is NP-hard even under various natural restrictions such as identical processing times and day-independent due dates. We also provide efficient algorithms for several special cases and analyze the parameterized tractability of the problem with respect to several parameters, providing both parameterized hardness and tractability results.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Price Collusion in Two-sided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic price collusion facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms raises significant concerns. We examine how AI agents using Q-learning engage in tacit collusion in two-sided markets. Our experiments reveal that AI-driven platforms achieve higher collusion levels compared to Bertrand competition. Increased network externalities significantly enhance collusion, suggesting AI algorithms exploit them to maximize profits. Higher user heterogeneity or greater utility from outside options generally reduce collusion, while higher discount rates increase it. Tacit collusion remains feasible even at low discount rates. To mitigate collusive behavior and inform potential regulatory measures, we propose incorporating a penalty term in the Q-learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Strategic Decision Makers? A Study of Performance and Bias in Two-Player Non-Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in real-world settings, yet their strategic abilities remain largely unexplored. Game theory provides a good framework for assessing the decision-making abilities of LLMs in interactions with other agents. Although prior studies have shown that LLMs can solve these tasks with carefully curated prompts, they fail when the problem setting or prompt changes. In this work we investigate LLMs' behaviour in strategic games, Stag Hunt and Prisoner Dilemma, analyzing performance variations under different settings and prompts. Our results show that the tested state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit at least one of the following systematic biases: (1) positional bias, (2) payoff bias, or (3) behavioural bias. Subsequently, we observed that the LLMs' performance drops when the game configuration is misaligned with the affecting biases. Performance is assessed based on the selection of the correct action, one which agrees with the prompted preferred behaviours of both players. Alignment refers to whether the LLM's bias aligns with the correct action. For example, GPT-4o's average performance drops by 34% when misaligned. Additionally, the current trend of "bigger and newer is better" does not hold for the above, where GPT-4o (the current best-performing LLM) suffers the most substantial performance drop. Lastly, we note that while chain-of-thought prompting does reduce the effect of the biases on most models, it is far from solving the problem at the fundamental level.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Player Potential Game Approach for Sensor Network Localization with Noisy Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor network localization (SNL) is a challenging problem due to its inherent non-convexity and the effects of noise in inter-node ranging measurements and anchor node position. We formulate a non-convex SNL problem as a multi-player non-convex potential game and investigate the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium (NE) in both the ideal setting without measurement noise and the practical setting with measurement noise. We first show that the NE exists and is unique in the noiseless case, and corresponds to the precise network localization. Then, we study the SNL for the case with errors affecting the anchor node position and the inter-node distance measurements. Specifically, we establish that in case these errors are sufficiently small, the NE exists and is unique. It is shown that the NE is an approximate solution to the SNL problem, and that the position errors can be quantified accordingly. Based on these findings, we apply the results to case studies involving only inter-node distance measurement errors and only anchor position information inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Dynamics of Identity and Fairness in Ultimatum Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Allocation games are zero-sum games that model the distribution of resources among multiple agents. In this paper, we explore the interplay between an \textit{subjective identity} and its impact on notions of fairness in allocation. The sense of identity in agents is known to lead to responsible decision-making in non-cooperative, non-zero-sum games like Prisoners' Dilemma, and is a desirable feature to add into agent models. However, when it comes to allocation, the sense of identity can be shown to exacerbate inequities in allocation, giving no rational incentive for agents to act fairly towards one another. This lead us to introduce a sense of fairness as an innate characteristic of autonomous agency. For this, we implement the well-known Ultimatum Game between two agents, where their sense of identity association and their sense of fairness are both varied. We study the points at which agents find it no longer rational to identify with the other agent, and uphold their sense of fairness, and vice versa. Such a study also helps us discern the subtle difference between responsibility and fairness when it comes to autonomous agency.</description>

      <title>Learning to Mitigate Externalities: the Coase Theorem with Hindsight Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In economic theory, the concept of externality refers to any indirect effect resulting from an interaction between players that affects the social welfare. Most of the models within which externality has been studied assume that agents have perfect knowledge of their environment and preferences. This is a major hindrance to the practical implementation of many proposed solutions. To address this issue, we consider a two-player bandit setting where the actions of one of the players affect the other player and we extend the Coase theorem [Coase, 1960]. This result shows that the optimal approach for maximizing the social welfare in the presence of externality is to establish property rights, i.e., enable transfers and bargaining between the players. Our work removes the classical assumption that bargainers possess perfect knowledge of the underlying game. We first demonstrate that in the absence of property rights, the social welfare breaks down. We then design a policy for the players which allows them to learn a bargaining strategy which maximizes the total welfare, recovering the Coase theorem under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Fair Division of Indivisible Chores via Earning Restricted Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fair division of $m$ indivisible chores among $n$ agents with additive preferences. We consider the desirable fairness notions of envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX) and envy-freeness up to $k$ chores (EF$k$), alongside the efficiency notion of Pareto optimality (PO). We present the first constant approximations of these notions, showing the existence of:
  - 5-EFX allocations, which improves the best-known factor of $O(n^2)$-EFX.
  - 3-EFX and PO allocations for the special case of bivalued instances, which improves the best-known factor of $O(n)$-EFX without any efficiency guarantees.
  - 2-EF2 + PO allocations, which improves the best-known factor of EF$m$ and PO.
  A notable contribution of our work is the introduction of the novel concept of earning-restricted (ER) competitive equilibrium for fractional allocations, which limits agents' earnings from each chore. Technically, our work addresses two main challenges: proving the existence of an ER equilibrium and designing algorithms that leverage ER equilibria to achieve the above results. To tackle the first challenge, we formulate a linear complementarity problem (LCP) formulation that captures all ER equilibria and show that the classic complementary pivot algorithm on the LCP must terminate at an ER equilibrium. For the second challenge, we carefully set the earning limits and use properties of ER equilibria to design sophisticated procedures that involve swapping and merging bundles to meet the desired fairness and efficiency criteria. We expect that the concept of ER equilibrium will be instrumental in deriving further results on related problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a game where players selfishly choose a resource and endure a cost depending on the number of players choosing nearby resources. We model the influences among resources by a weighted graph, directed or not. These games are generalizations of well-known games like Wardrop and congestion games. We study the conditions of equilibria existence and their efficiency if they exist. We conclude with studies of games whose influences among resources can be modelled by simple graphs.</description>
