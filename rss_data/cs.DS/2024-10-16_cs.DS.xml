      <title>The Quasi-probability Method and Applications for Trace Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the trace reconstruction problem, one attempts to reconstruct a fixed but unknown string $x$ of length $n$ from a given number of traces $\tilde{x}$ drawn iid from the application of a noisy process (such as the deletion channel) to $x$. The best known algorithm for the trace reconstruction from the deletion channel is due to Chase, and recovers the input string whp given $\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/5}))$ traces [Cha21b].
  The main component in Chase's algorithm is a procedure for k-mer estimation, which, for any marker $w$ in $\{0, 1\}^k$ of length $k$, computes a "smoothed" distribution of its appearances in the input string $x$ [CGL+23, MS24]. Current k-mer estimation algorithms fail when the deletion probability is above $1/2$, requiring a more complex analysis for Chase's algorithm. Moreover, the only known extension of these approaches beyond the deletion channels is based on numerically estimating high-order differentials of a multivariate polynomial, making it highly impractical [Rub23].
  In this paper, we construct a simple Monte Carlo method for k-mer estimation which can be easily applied to a much wider variety of channels. In particular, we solve k-mer estimation for any combination of insertion, deletion, and bit-flip channels, even in the high deletion probability regime, allowing us to directly apply Chase's algorithm for this wider class of channels.
  To accomplish this, we utilize an approach from the field of quantum error mitigation (the process of using many measurements from noisy quantum computers to simulate a clean quantum computer), called the quasi-probability method (also known as probabilistic error cancellation) [TBG17, PSW22]. We derive a completely classical version of this technique, and use it to construct a k-mer estimation algorithm.
  No background in quantum computing is needed to understand this paper.</description>

      <title>Subquadratic algorithms in minor-free digraphs: (weighted) distance oracles, decremental reachability, and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Le and Wulff-Nilsen [SODA '24] initiated a systematic study of VC set systems to unweighted $K_h$-minor-free directed graphs. We extend their results in the following ways:
  $\bullet$ We present the first application of VC set systems for real-weighted minor-free digraphs to build the first exact subquadratic-space distance oracle with $O(\log n)$ query time. Prior work using VC set systems only applied in unweighted and integer weighted digraphs.
  $\bullet$ We describe a unified system for analyzing the VC dimension of balls and the LP set system (based on Li--Parter [STOC '19]) of Le--Wulff-Nilsen [SODA '24] using pseudodimension. This is a major conceptual contribution that allows for both improving our understanding of set systems in digraphs as well as improving the bound of the LP set system in directed graphs to $h-1$.
  $\bullet$ We present the first application of these set systems in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we construct decremental reachability oracles with subquadratic total update time and constant query time. Prior to this work, it was not known if this was possible to construct oracles with subquadratic total update time and polylogarithmic query time, even in planar digraphs.
  $\bullet$ We describe subquadratic time algorithms for unweighted digraphs including (1) constructions of exact distance oracles, (2) computation of vertex eccentricities and Wiener index. The main innovation in obtaining these results is the use of dynamic string data structures.</description>

      <title>Ranking with Multiple Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In search and advertisement ranking, it is often required to simultaneously maximize multiple objectives. For example, the objectives can correspond to multiple intents of a search query, or in the context of advertising, they can be relevance and revenue. It is important to efficiently find rankings which strike a good balance between such objectives. Motivated by such applications, we formulate a general class of problems where
  - each result gets a different score corresponding to each objective,
  - the results of a ranking are aggregated by taking, for each objective, a weighted sum of the scores in the order of the ranking, and
  - an arbitrary concave function of the aggregates is maximized.
  Combining the aggregates using a concave function will naturally lead to more balanced outcomes. We give an approximation algorithm in a bicriteria/resource augmentation setting: the algorithm with a slight advantage does as well as the optimum. In particular, if the aggregation step is just the sum of the top k results, then the algorithm outputs k + 1 results which do as well the as the optimal top k results. We show how this approach helps with balancing different objectives via simulations on synthetic data as well as on real data from LinkedIn.</description>

      <title>Orienteering (with Time Windows) on Restricted Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph with edge costs and vertex profits and given a budget B, the Orienteering Problem asks for a walk of cost at most B of maximum profit. Additionally, each profit may be given with a time window within it can be collected by the walk.
  While the Orienteering Problem and thus the version with time windows are NP-hard in general, it remains open on numerous special graph classes. Since in several applications, especially for planning a route from A to B with waypoints, the input graph can be restricted to tree-like or path-like structures, in this paper we consider orienteering on these graph classes.
  While the Orienteering Problem with time windows is NP-hard even on undirected paths and cycles, and remains so even if all profits must be collected, we show that for directed paths it can be solved efficiently, even if each profit can be collected in one of several time windows. The same case is shown to be NP-hard for directed cycles.
  Particularly interesting is the Orienteering Problem on a directed cycle with one time window per profit. We give an efficient algorithm for the case where all time windows are shorter than the length of the cycle, resulting in a 2-approximation for the general setting. We further develop a polynomial-time approximation scheme for this problem and give a polynomial algorithm for the case where all profits must be collected.
  For the Orienteering Problem with time windows for the edges, we give a quadratic time algorithm for undirected paths and observe that the problem is NP-hard for trees.
  In the variant without time windows, we show that on trees and thus on graphs with bounded tree-width the Orienteering Problem remains NP-hard. We present, however, an FPT algorithm to solve orienteering with unit profits that we then use to obtain a ($1+\varepsilon$)-approximation algorithm on graphs with arbitrary profits and bounded tree-width.</description>

      <title>Even Faster $(\Delta + 1)$-Edge Coloring via Shorter Multi-Step Vizing Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vizing's Theorem from 1964 states that any $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ can be {\em edge colored} using at most $\Delta + 1$ colors. For over 40 years, the state-of-the-art running time for computing such a coloring, obtained independently by Arjomandi [1982] and by Gabow, Nishizeki, Kariv, Leven and Terada~[1985], was $\tilde O(m\sqrt{n})$. Very recently, this time bound was improved in two independent works, by Bhattacharya, Carmon, Costa, Solomon and Zhang to $\tilde O(mn^{1/3})$, and by Assadi to $\tilde O(n^2)$.
  In this paper we present an algorithm that computes such a coloring in $\tilde O(mn^{1/4})$ time. Our key technical contribution is a subroutine for extending the coloring to one more edge within time $\tilde O(\Delta^2 + \sqrt{\Delta n})$. The best previous time bound of any color extension subroutine is either the trivial $O(n)$, dominated by the length of a Vizing chain, or the bound $\tilde{O}(\Delta^6)$ by Bernshteyn [2022], dominated by the length of {\em multi-step Vizing chains}, which is basically a concatenation of multiple (carefully chosen) Vizing chains. Our color extension subroutine produces significantly shorter multi-step Vizing chains than in previous works, for sufficiently large $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear distance query reconstruction for graphs of bounded treelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distance query reconstruction, we wish to reconstruct the edge set of a hidden graph by asking as few distance queries as possible to an oracle. Given two vertices $u$ and $v$, the oracle returns the shortest path distance between $u$ and $v$ in the graph.
  The length of a tree decomposition is the maximum distance between two vertices contained in the same bag. The treelength of a graph is defined as the minimum length of a tree decomposition of this graph. We present an algorithm to reconstruct an $n$-vertex connected graph $G$ parameterized by maximum degree $\Delta$ and treelength $k$ in $O_{k,\Delta}(n \log^2 n)$ queries (in expectation). This is the first algorithm to achieve quasi-linear complexity for this class of graphs. The proof goes through a new lemma that could give independent insight on graphs of bounded treelength.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy on Trust Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differential privacy (DP) in a multi-party setting where each party only trusts a (known) subset of the other parties with its data. Specifically, given a trust graph where vertices correspond to parties and neighbors are mutually trusting, we give a DP algorithm for aggregation with a much better privacy-utility trade-off than in the well-studied local model of DP (where each party trusts no other party). We further study a robust variant where each party trusts all but an unknown subset of at most $t$ of its neighbors (where $t$ is a given parameter), and give an algorithm for this setting. We complement our algorithms with lower bounds, and discuss implications of our work to other tasks in private learning and analytics.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Newsvendor on a Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a fundamental generalization of the classical newsvendor problem where the seller needs to decide on the inventory of a product jointly for multiple locations on a metric as well as a fulfillment policy to satisfy the uncertain demand that arises sequentially over time after the inventory decisions have been made. To address the distributional ambiguity, we consider a distributionally robust setting where the decision-maker only knows the mean and variance of the demand, and the goal is to make inventory and fulfillment decisions to minimize the worst-case expected inventory and fulfillment cost. We design a near-optimal policy for the problem with theoretical guarantees on its performance. Our policy generalizes the classical solution of Scarf (1957), maintaining its simplicity and interpretability: it identifies a hierarchical set of clusters, assigns a ``virtual" underage cost to each cluster, then makes sure that each cluster holds at least the inventory suggested by Scarf's solution if the cluster behaved as a single point with ``virtual" underage cost. As demand arrives sequentially, our policy fulfills orders from nearby clusters, minimizing fulfilment costs, while balancing inventory consumption across the clusters to avoid depleting any single one. We show that the policy achieves a poly-logarithmic approximation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with provable performance guarantees. Furthermore, our numerical experiments show that the policy performs well in practice.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguring homomorphisms to reflexive graphs via a simple reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and two graph homomorphisms $\alpha$ and $\beta$ from $G$ to a fixed graph $H$, the problem $H$-Recoloring asks whether there is a transformation from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ that changes the image of a single vertex at each step and keeps a graph homomorphism throughout. The complexity of the problem depends among other things on the presence of loops on the vertices. We provide a simple reduction that, using a known algorithmic result for $H$-Recoloring for square-free irreflexive graphs $H$, yields a polynomial-time algorithm for $H$-Recoloring for square-free reflexive graphs $H$. This generalizes all known algorithmic results for $H$-Recoloring for reflexive graphs $H$. Furthermore, the construction allows us to recover some of the known hardness results. Finally, we provide a partial inverse of the construction for bipartite instances.</description>

      <title>The state hidden subgroup problem and an efficient algorithm for locating unentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of entanglement testing which we call the "hidden cut problem." Taking as input copies of an $n$-qubit pure state which is product across an unknown bipartition, the goal is to learn precisely where the state is unentangled, i.e. to determine which of the exponentially many possible cuts separates the state. We give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm which can find the cut using $O(n/\epsilon^2)$ many copies of the state, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Our algorithm also generalizes to learn the entanglement structure of arbitrary product states. In the special case of Haar-random states, we further show that our algorithm requires circuits of only constant depth. To develop our algorithm, we introduce a state generalization of the hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) which might be of independent interest, in which one is given a quantum state invariant under an unknown subgroup action, with the goal of learning the hidden symmetry subgroup. We show how the hidden cut problem can be formulated as a StateHSP with a carefully chosen Abelian group action. We then prove that Fourier sampling on the hidden cut state produces similar outcomes as a variant of the well-known Simon's problem, allowing us to find the hidden cut efficiently. Therefore, our algorithm can be interpreted as an extension of Simon's algorithm to entanglement testing. We discuss possible applications of StateHSP and hidden cut problems to cryptography and pseudorandomness.</description>

      <title>On the sample complexity of purity and inner product estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the prototypical tasks quantum purity estimation and quantum inner product estimation. In purity estimation, we are to estimate $tr(\rho^2)$ of an unknown quantum state $\rho$ to additive error $\epsilon$. Meanwhile, for quantum inner product estimation, Alice and Bob are to estimate $tr(\rho\sigma)$ to additive error $\epsilon$ given copies of unknown quantum state $\rho$ and $\sigma$ using classical communication and restricted quantum communication.
  In this paper, we show a strong connection between the sample complexity of purity estimation with bounded quantum memory and inner product estimation with bounded quantum communication and unentangled measurements. We propose a protocol that solves quantum inner product estimation with $k$-qubit one-way quantum communication and unentangled local measurements using $O(median\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\epsilon,2^{n-k}/\epsilon^2\})$ copies of $\rho$ and $\sigma$. Our protocol can be modified to estimate the purity of an unknown quantum state $\rho$ using $k$-qubit quantum memory with the same complexity. We prove that arbitrary protocols with $k$-qubit quantum memory that estimate purity to error $\epsilon$ require $\Omega(median\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\sqrt{\epsilon},2^{n-k}/\epsilon^2\})$ copies of $\rho$. This indicates the same lower bound for quantum inner product estimation with one-way $k$-qubit quantum communication and classical communication, and unentangled local measurements. For purity estimation, we further improve the lower bound to $\Omega(\max\{1/\epsilon^2,2^{n/2}/\epsilon\})$ for any protocols using an identical single-copy projection-valued measurement.
  Additionally, we investigate a decisional variant of quantum distributed inner product estimation without quantum communication for mixed state and provide a lower bound on the sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Prophet Upper Bounds for Online Matching and Auctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the online 2-bounded auction problem, we have a collection of items represented as nodes in a graph and bundles of size two represented by edges. Agents are presented sequentially, each with a random weight function over the bundles. The goal of the decision-maker is to find an allocation of bundles to agents of maximum weight so that every item is assigned at most once, i.e., the solution is a matching in the graph. When the agents are single-minded (i.e., put all the weight in a single bundle), we recover the maximum weight prophet matching problem under edge arrivals (a.k.a. prophet matching).
  In this work, we provide new and improved upper bounds on the competitiveness achievable by an algorithm for the general online 2-bounded auction and the (single-minded) prophet matching problems. For adversarial arrival order of the agents, we show that no algorithm for the online 2-bounded auction problem achieves a competitiveness larger than $4/11$, while no algorithm for prophet matching achieves a competitiveness larger than $\approx 0.4189$. Using a continuous-time analysis, we also improve the known bounds for online 2-bounded auctions for random order arrivals to $\approx 0.5968$ in the general case, a bound of $\approx 0.6867$ in the IID model, and $\approx 0.6714$ in prophet-secretary model.</description>

      <title>Optimal distance query reconstruction for graphs without long induced cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given access to the vertex set $V$ of a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and an oracle that given two vertices $u,v\in V$, returns the shortest path distance between $u$ and $v$, how many queries are needed to reconstruct $E$?
  Firstly, we show that randomised algorithms need to use at least $\frac1{200} \Delta n\log_\Delta n$ queries in expectation in order to reconstruct $n$-vertex trees of maximum degree $\Delta$. The best previous lower bound (for graphs of bounded maximum degree) was an information-theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n/\log \log n)$. Our randomised lower bound is also the first to break through the information-theoretic barrier for related query models including distance queries for phylogenetic trees, membership queries for learning partitions and path queries in directed trees.
  Secondly, we provide a simple deterministic algorithm to reconstruct trees using $\Delta n\log_\Delta n+(\Delta+2)n$ distance queries. This proves that our lower bound is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We extend our algorithm to reconstruct graphs without induced cycles of length at least $k$ using $O_{\Delta,k}(n\log n)$ queries. Our lower bound is therefore tight for a wide range of tree-like graphs, such as chordal graphs, permutation graphs and AT-free graphs. The previously best randomised algorithm for chordal graphs used $O_{\Delta}(n\log^2 n)$ queries in expectation, so we improve by a $(\log n)$-factor for this graph class.</description>

      <title>Exploring Monotone Priority Queues for Dijkstra Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of monotone priority queues, focusing on their evolution and application in shortest path algorithms. Monotone priority queues are characterized by the property that their minimum key does not decrease over time, making them particularly effective for label-setting algorithms like Dijkstra's. Some key data structures within this category are explored, emphasizing those derived directly from Dial's algorithm, including variations of multi-level bucket structures and radix heaps. Theoretical complexities and practical considerations of these structures are discussed, with insights into their development and refinement provided through a historical timeline.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fourier Transform for Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information processing and its subfield, quantum image processing, are rapidly growing fields as a result of advancements in the practicality of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for processing information, such as one-dimensional time series and two-dimensional images, in the frequency domain. The information of interest is encoded into the magnitude of probability amplitude or the coefficient of each basis state. The oracle for filtering operates based on postselection results, and its explicit circuit design is presented. This oracle is versatile enough to perform all basic filtering, including high pass, low pass, band pass, band stop, and many other processing techniques. Finally, we present two novel schemes for transposing matrices in this paper. They use similar encoding rules but with deliberate choices in terms of selecting basis states. These schemes could potentially be useful for other quantum information processing tasks, such as edge detection. The proposed techniques are implemented on the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. Some results are compared with traditional information processing results to verify their correctness and are presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>A quantum central path algorithm for linear optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving linear optimization problems by quantum-mechanical simulation of the central path. While interior point methods follow the central path with an iterative algorithm that works with successive linearizations of the perturbed KKT conditions, we perform a single simulation working directly with the nonlinear complementarity equations. This approach yields an algorithm for solving linear optimization problems involving $m$ constraints and $n$ variables to $\varepsilon$-optimality using $\mathcal{O} \left( \sqrt{m + n} \frac{R_{1}}{\varepsilon}\right)$ queries to an oracle that evaluates a potential function, where $R_{1}$ is an $\ell_{1}$-norm upper bound on the size of the optimal solution. In the standard gate model (i.e., without access to quantum RAM) our algorithm can obtain highly-precise solutions to LO problems using at most $$\mathcal{O} \left( \sqrt{m + n} \textsf{nnz} (A) \frac{R_1}{\varepsilon}\right)$$ elementary gates, where $\textsf{nnz} (A)$ is the total number of non-zero elements found in the constraint matrix.</description>

      <title>Resolving Sets in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A resolving set $R$ in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices such that every vertex of $G$ is uniquely identified by its distances to the vertices of $R$. Introduced in the 1970s, this concept has been since then extensively studied from both combinatorial and algorithmic points of view. We propose a generalization of the concept of resolving sets to temporal graphs,i.e., graphs with edge sets that change over discrete time-steps. In this setting, the temporal distance from $u$ to $v$ is the earliest possible time-step at which a journey with strictly increasing time-steps on edges leaving $u$ reaches $v$, i.e., the first time-step at which $v$ could receive a message broadcast from $u$. A temporal resolving set of a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is a subset $R$ of its vertices such that every vertex of $\mathcal{G}$ is uniquely identified by its temporal distances from vertices of $R$.
  We study the problem of finding a minimum-size temporal resolving set, and show that it is NP-complete even on very restricted graph classes and with strong constraints on the time-steps: temporal complete graphs where every edge appears in either time-step~1 or~2, temporal trees where every edge appears in at most two consecutive time-steps, and even temporal subdivided stars where every edge appears in at most two (not necessarily consecutive) time-steps. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for temporal paths and temporal stars where every edge appears in exactly one time-step, and give a combinatorial analysis and algorithms for several temporal graph classes where the edges appear in periodic time-steps.</description>

      <title>On The MCMC Performance In Bernoulli Group Testing And The Random Max Set-Cover Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The group testing problem is a canonical inference task where one seeks to identify $k$ infected individuals out of a population of $n$ people, based on the outcomes of $m$ group tests. Of particular interest is the case of Bernoulli group testing (BGT), where each individual participates in each test independently and with a fixed probability. BGT is known to be an "information-theoretically" optimal design, as there exists a decoder that can identify with high probability as $n$ grows the infected individuals using $m^*=\log_2 \binom{n}{k}$ BGT tests, which is the minimum required number of tests among \emph{all} group testing designs.
  An important open question in the field is if a polynomial-time decoder exists for BGT which succeeds also with $m^*$ samples. In a recent paper (Iliopoulos, Zadik COLT '21) some evidence was presented (but no proof) that a simple low-temperature MCMC method could succeed. The evidence was based on a first-moment (or "annealed") analysis of the landscape, as well as simulations that show the MCMC success for $n \approx 1000s$.
  In this work, we prove that, despite the intriguing success in simulations for small $n$, the class of MCMC methods proposed in previous work for BGT with $m^*$ samples takes super-polynomial-in-$n$ time to identify the infected individuals, when $k=n^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ small enough. Towards obtaining our results, we establish the tight max-satisfiability thresholds of the random $k$-set cover problem, a result of potentially independent interest in the study of random constraint satisfaction problems.</description>
