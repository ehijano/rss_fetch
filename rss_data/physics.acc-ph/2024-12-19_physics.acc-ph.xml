      <title>Near-Infrared noise in intense electron bunches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates electron bunch density fluctuations in the 1 - 10 $\mu m$ wavelength range, focusing on their impact on coherent electron cooling (CEC) in hadron storage rings. In this study, we thoroughly compare the shot-noise model with experimental observations of optical transition radiation (OTR) generated by a relativistic electron bunch ($\gamma \approx$ 50), transiting an Aluminium metal surface. The bunch parameters are close to those proposed for a stage in an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), where the bunch size is much larger than the OTR wavelength being measured. Here we present measurements and particle tracking results of both the low-level noise for the EIC bunch parameters and longitudinal space-charge-induced microbunching for the chicane-compressed bunch with coherent OTR enhancements up to 100 times in the various bandwidth-filtered near-infrared (NIR) OTR photodiode signals. We also discuss the corresponding limitations of the OTR method.</description>

      <title>RF heating experiments with a TESLA-9-cell cavity towards in-situ low- / mid-T-baking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under-vacuum low- and mid-temperature baking revealed beneficial effects on the performance of niobium-made cavities for superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) applications, primarily seen in particle accelerators. Such a baking process is typically performed in a dedicated oven. In this paper the experimental investigation is described, whether an appropriate heating of an elliptical 9-cell 1.3 GHz TESLA cavity is feasible using rf power, which would be a pre-condition for a processing done fully in-situ without the need of costly and risky dismantling / remounting operations. It is demonstrated that such a heating is possible, whilst complicated by uneven heating rates in the individual cavity cells.</description>

      <title>Energy recovery twin linear $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ colliders (ERLC ) with high luminosities and acceleration gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a high-energy superconducting $e^+e^-$ linear collider with energy recovery (ERLC) has been proposed, using twin RF structures to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider could operate in DC (duty cycle) or CW (continuous) mode, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=$250-500 GeV. In this paper, we find that the luminosity of the ERLC operating in DC mode does not depend on the accelerating gradient (for the same total power), allowing the ERLC to operate at the maximum available accelerating gradients. We also consider for the first time an $e^-e^-$ twin collider with energy recovery and estimate its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one. It does not require beam recycling, since electrons can be produced anew each time. Travelling-wave RF structures allow higher gradients and reduced thermal loading. It is shown that an ERLC with an acceleration gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m can be operated in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1-2.5)$10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3-7)$10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable powers of 150 and 300 MW at $2E_0=250$ and 500 GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.</description>

      <title>New full simulation model of crystal-based beam extraction using BDSim toolkit enhanced with Geant4 G4ChannelingFastSimModel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the development of a full simulation model for crystal-based beam extraction utilizing the BDSim toolkit in conjunction with the Geant4 G4ChannelingFastSimModel and G4BaierKatkov frameworks. A novel accelerator component - a bent crystal compatible with G4ChannelingFastSimModel - was designed and implemented. As a demonstration, we constructed a complete simulation model of the DESY II Booster Synchrotron within BDSim, incorporating all relevant components. The model accounts for betatron and synchrotron oscillations, as well as radiation losses in the oriented crystal, using G4BaierKatkov. Simulation results demonstrate the successful extraction of a primary monoenergetic 6 GeV electron beam, characterized by a charge of 23 pC, a horizontal beam emittance of 3.6 $\mu$m$\cdot$rad, a vertical beam emittance of 0.32 $\mu$m$\cdot$rad, and an energy spread of 0.008. This approach provides a powerful tool to significantly accelerate R&amp;D for applications related to crystal-based extraction and collimation in synchrotrons and colliders.</description>
