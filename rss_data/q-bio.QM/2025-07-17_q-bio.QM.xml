      <title>A critical phase transition in bee movement dynamics can be modeled using a 2D cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective behavior of numerous animal species, including insects, exhibits scale-free behavior indicative of the critical (second-order) phase transition. Previous research uncovered such phenomena in the behavior of honeybees, most notably the long-range correlations in space and time. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the bee activity in the hive manifests the hallmarks of the jamming process. We follow up by presenting a discrete model of the system that faithfully replicates some of the key features found in the data - such as the divergence of correlation length and scale-free distribution of jammed clusters. The dependence of the correlation length on the control parameter - density is demonstrated for both the real data and the model. We conclude with a brief discussion on the contribution of the insights provided by the model to our understanding of the insects' collective behavior.</description>

      <title>STAGED: A Multi-Agent Neural Network for Learning Cellular Interaction Dynamics</title>

Abstract: The advent of single-cell technology has significantly improved our understanding of cellular states and subpopulations in various tissues under normal and diseased conditions by employing data-driven approaches such as clustering and trajectory inference. However, these methods consider cells as independent data points of population distributions. With spatial transcriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic cell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key computational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such complex interactive cellular dynamics. While agent-based modeling (ABM) provides a powerful framework, traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rules derived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address this, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED) integrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and its effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE networks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents genes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning their strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match continuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from spatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and intracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate representation of cellular dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Graph-in-Graph Learning Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph, enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics, highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and interaction data.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Latent Euclidean Geometry in Single-Cell VAEs for Manifold Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent space interpolations are a powerful tool for navigating deep generative models in applied settings. An example is single-cell RNA sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry. Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.</description>

      <title>Protenix-Mini: Efficient Structure Predictor via Compact Architecture, Few-Step Diffusion and Switchable pLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and other downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. In this work, we address the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process, Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.</description>

      <title>Interactive Hybrid Rice Breeding with Parametric Dual Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits, such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids, which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback from breeders.</description>

      <title>When $B_2$ is Not Enough: Evaluating Simple Metrics for Predicting Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12312v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.</description>

      <title>CytoSAE: Interpretable Cell Embeddings for Hematology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model. While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the sub-cellular level.

      <title>Triplication: an important component of the modern scientific method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A protocol deployed in a scientific study is designed to bring results to a state from which inductive inference is allowed to be made. In the nineteenth century triplication was introduced into the plant sciences, and Fisher's p&lt;0.05 rule (1925) was incorporated to give a triple-result protocol designed to counter random and systematic errors. The aims here were: to define replication protocols (including a non-replicated protocol); assess prevalences for the plant sciences in one year (2017) in the twenty-first century for one particular science type; and to elucidate the theoretical basis for triplication. Methods involved: survey of the entire field of plant sciences to produce a protocol-prevalence report; an assessment of association versus experimental studies; and use of real-world-data proxies to show confidence-interval-width patterns with increasing replicate number. Results showed that triplication was extensively applied (in ~70% of studies) in the plant sciences, with triple-result protocols in ~15% of studies. Theoretical considerations showed that, even if systematic errors predominate, square-root rules are likely to apply to many datasets, and real-world-data proxy examples are given. Conclusions are: there are strong theoretical reasons why (1) triplication (rather than duplication or quadruplication) is the standard; and (2) a triple-result (rather than global) protocol is optimal; additionally (3) that standards in the plant sciences remain at high levels despite the immense pressures for publication.</description>

      <title>DT4PCP: A Digital Twin Framework for Personalized Care Planning Applied to Type 2 Diabetes Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a transformative approach in healthcare, but its application in personalized patient care remains limited. This paper aims to present a practical implementation of DT in the management of chronic diseases. We introduce a general DT framework for personalized care planning (DT4PCP), with the core components being a real-time virtual representation of a patient's health and emerging predictive models to enable adaptive, personalized care. We implemented the DT4PCP framework for managing Type 2 Diabetes (DT4PCP-T2D), enabling real-time collection of behavioral data from patients with T2D, predicting emergency department (ED) risks, simulating the effects of different interventions, and personalizing care strategies to reduce ED visits. The DT4PCP-T2D also integrates social determinants of health (SDoH) and other contextual data, offering a comprehensive view of the patient's health to ensure that care recommendations are tailored to individual needs. Through retrospective simulations, we demonstrate that integrating DTs in T2D management can lead to significant advancements in personalized medicine. This study underscores the potential of DT technology to revolutionize chronic disease care.</description>

      <title>A PBN-RL-XAI Framework for Discovering a "Hit-and-Run" Therapeutic Strategy in Melanoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</description>
