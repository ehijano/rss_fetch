      <title>Quantifying Reconnection and it's Dynamical Role in 2D Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21532</link>

Abstract: Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) governs material transport and mixing in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas under the influence of gravity and magnetic fields. While magnetic reconnection is known to occur during MRTI evolution, its role in the evolution and energy dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of reconnection in the two-dimensional MRTI dynamics, using high-resolution simulations. We establish that reconnection, through facilitating plume merger, relieving magnetic tension, and enabling continued instability growth, forms an essential component for the long-term instability evolution. To quantify the role of reconnection in energy dynamics, we develop a robust automated reconnection detection algorithm and perform a statistical analysis across a range of magnetic field strengths. We find that reconnection accounts for up to $80\%$ of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer in the weak magnetic field regime, while contributing minimally ($\approx 3\%$) to magnetic energy dissipation. Our results establish magnetic reconnection as a critical mechanism that regulates large-scale MRTI dynamics, with implications for astrophysical plasmas and turbulent mixing in magnetized flows.</description>

      <title>Enhanced receiver function imaging of crustal structures using symmetric autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The receiver-function (RF) technique aims to recover receiver-side crustal and mantle structures by deconvolving either the radial or transverse component with the vertical component seismogram. Analysis of the variations of RFs along the backazimuth and slowness is the key in determining the geometry and anisotropic properties of the crustal structures. However, the deconvolution introduces pseudorandom nuisance effects, due to unknown earthquake source signatures and seismic noise, which obstruct the precise extraction of backazimuth and slowness dependent crustal effects. Our goal is to obtain RFs with minimal nuisance effects, while preserving the crustal effects. In this study, we introduced a new method for reducing nuisance effects in RFs. This method generates virtual RFs through a deep generative model, namely symmetric variational autoencoders (SymVAE). Our autoencoder efficiently learns to disentangle coherent crustal effects and nuisance effects within its latent space, given a set of RFs derived from a cluster of nearby earthquakes. This disentanglement enables generation of virtual RFs which exhibits minimal nuisance effects while preserving the coherent crustal effects. We tested SymVAE using synthetic RFs with ambient seismic noise. We also tested using dense seismic networks in two distinct geological settings: the Cascadia subduction zone and southern California. We compared our method with linear and phase-weighted averaging. In both synthetic and real RFs, the generated virtual RFs demonstrate enhanced information related to crustal structures. We have also quantitatively assessed the performance. One major advantage of our method over traditional methods is its ability to utilize all available earthquake data, regardless of signal quality, resulting in improved backazimuth and slowness coverage.</description>

      <title>Model for the Thermodynamics of Iron at High Pressures Near Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fe pressure-temperature phase diagram and its melting line have a wide range of applications, including providing constraints for iron-core planetary models. We propose an equation of state (EOS) model based on the interstitial theory of simple condensed matter (ITCM), as suggested by A.V. Granato. When applied to Fe, this model enables the extrapolation of measured melting lines to the conditions of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB). The ITCM describes the solid-liquid phase transition in metals as resulting from a strong structural perturbation due to a high concentration of interstitial-like defects. The strong nonlinearity of their self-interaction causes the stabilization of this interstitial-rich phase. The original model is expanded to describe melting over a wide range of pressures and temperatures rather than focusing on a specific isobaric transition. Using this model, we fit the measured melting data, extrapolate it to cover ICB conditions, and develop a multiphase equation of state that encompasses this regime. The model is used to explain contradictory data regarding the location of the melting line, resulting from a novel phase transition between two separate liquid phases, specifically between FCC-based and HCP-based liquids. This additional liquid phase offers a new interpretation of the previously suggested near-melting high-pressure phase and may also provide a solution to the inner core nucleation paradox.</description>

      <title>Real-time Bayesian inference at extreme scale: A digital twin for tsunami early warning applied to the Cascadia subduction zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian inversion-based digital twin that employs acoustic pressure data from seafloor sensors, along with 3D coupled acoustic-gravity wave equations, to infer earthquake-induced spatiotemporal seafloor motion in real time and forecast tsunami propagation toward coastlines for early warning with quantified uncertainties. Our target is the Cascadia subduction zone, with one billion parameters. Computing the posterior mean alone would require 50 years on a 512 GPU machine. Instead, exploiting the shift invariance of the parameter-to-observable map and devising novel parallel algorithms, we induce a fast offline-online decomposition. The offline component requires just one adjoint wave propagation per sensor; using MFEM, we scale this part of the computation to the full El Capitan system (43,520 GPUs) with 92% weak parallel efficiency. Moreover, given real-time data, the online component exactly solves the Bayesian inverse and forecasting problems in 0.2 seconds on a modest GPU system, a ten-billion-fold speedup.</description>

      <title>Sub-Neptunes Are Drier Than They Seem: Rethinking the Origins of Water-Rich Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent claims of biosignature gases in sub-Neptune atmospheres have renewed interest in water-rich sub-Neptunes with surface oceans, often referred to as Hycean planets. These planets are hypothesized to form beyond the snow line, accreting large amounts of H$_2$O (&gt;10 wt%) before migrating inward. However, current interior models often neglect chemical equilibration between primordial atmospheres and molten interiors. Here, we compute global chemical equilibrium states for a synthetic population of sub-Neptunes with magma oceans. Although many initially accrete 5-30 wt% water, interior-atmosphere interactions destroy most of it, reducing final H$_2$O mass fractions to below 1.5 wt%. As a result, none meet the threshold for Hycean planets. Despite that, we find H$_2$O-dominated atmospheres exclusively on planets that accreted the least ice. These planets form inside the snow line, are depleted in carbon and hydrogen, and develop small envelopes with envelope mass fractions below 1%, dominated by endogenic water. In contrast, planets formed beyond the snow line accrete more volatiles, but their water is largely converted to H$_2$ gas or sequestered into the interior, resulting in low atmospheric H$_2$O mass fractions. Most H$_2$O-rich envelopes are also fully miscible with H$_2$, making a separate water layer unlikely. Our results topple the conventional link between ice accretion and water-rich atmospheres, showing instead that H$_2$O-dominated envelopes emerge through chemical equilibration in hydrogen-poor planets formed inside the snow line.</description>
