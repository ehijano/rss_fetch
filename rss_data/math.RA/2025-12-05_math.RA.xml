      <title>Algebraic identities for linear operators on associative triple systems (long version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first classification of algebraic identities in 3 variables for linear operators on associative structures. We work in the context of associative triple systems, but since any associative algebra with product $xy$ becomes an associative triple system with product $xyz$, our results apply to associative algebras as well. This is the first time that Rota's classification problem for linear operators has been extended to algebras with an $n$-ary operation for $n \ge 3$. Our work is an application of computational linear algebra to the classification problem for linear operators. We begin with a generic operator identity with indeterminate coefficients. From this we use operadic partial compositions to derive a large sparse matrix whose nonzero entries are the indeterminates. We follow the rank principle which states that significant operator identities correspond to coefficients which produce submaximal rank of the matrix. For operator identities of multiplicity 1 (each term contains the operator once) we obtain 6 families with 1 parameter, and 1 isolated solution. For multiplicity 2, we obtain 6 families with 2 parameters, 27 families with 1 parameter, and 9 isolated solutions.</description>

      <title>Classification of Homogeneous Odd Rota--Baxter Operators on a Modified Witt-Type Lie Superalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all homogeneous odd (i.e., parity-reversing) Rota--Baxter operators of weight zero on the modified Witt-type Lie superalgebra $W = \langle L_m, G_n \rangle_{m,n\in\Z}$. Our classification shows that nontrivial such operators are highly constrained: either $g \equiv 0$ and $f$ is arbitrary, or $g \not\equiv 0$ forces $f \equiv 0$, and $g$ must take one of several rigid forms dictated by the integer shift $k$ (necessarily odd when $g(0) \neq 0$). We prove that every Rota--Baxter operator on $W$ decomposes uniquely into even and odd homogeneous components; we restrict our attention to the odd case, which yields the full nontrivial structure. Furthermore, we show that all derivations of $W$ are inner, that no Rota--Baxter operator on $W$ is invertible, and we describe the induced super pre-Lie algebra structure together with its cohomological interpretation.</description>

      <title>On invertibility of some polynomial maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of zero characteristic polynomial map $\xi: \mathbb{F}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{F}^n$ of the form $\xi(x)=x-((xA_1)^{3}, (xA_2)^{3},..., (xA_n)^{3})$, where $x=(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ a row vector of variables, $A_i\in \mathbb{F}^n$ are column vectors, is considered. It is shown that if $\det(\partial\xi(x))=1$, then $\xi$ is injective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Jordan--Kronecker invariant of finite dimensional complex Lie algebras. We present an explicit algorithm for determining the type of a given Lie algebra from its Jordan--Kronecker invariant. The algorithm is implemented in a specific Matlab program.</description>

      <title>Graded algebras with homogeneous involution and varieties of almost polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important aspect in the theory of algebras with polynomial identities is the study of the asymptotic behavior of the codimension sequence $c_n(A),\, n\geq 1,$ which measures the growth of polynomial identities of a given algebra $A$. In this context, graded identities naturally arise as prominent tools, since ordinary polynomial identities can be viewed as a particular case of graded identities. Moreover, as an involution does not necessarily preserve the homogeneous components of a grading, it is natural to consider the notion of a homogeneous involution. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the codimension sequence in the setting of $G$-graded algebras endowed with a homogeneous involution. More specifically, we characterize the varieties of polynomial growth in terms of the exclusion of a list of algebras from the variety. As a consequence, we provide the classification of the varieties with almost polynomial growth in this setting.</description>

      <title>Subregular J-Rings of the Finite Irreducible Coxeter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.11425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous papers, the author showed that in many cases of interest there exists an isomorphism between certain path algebras related to the structure of the subregular J-rings of Coxeter systems
  and matrix rings over a free product of rings. For the finite irreducible Coxeter systems, the application of the isomorphism theorems was straightforward in all but a few cases.
  In this paper we show how the isomorphism theorems can be applied to show that
  the path algebras in the remaining cases are isomorphic to a direct sum of matrix rings over
  the rational numbers or over a direct product of field extensions of the rational numbers.</description>

      <title>Projective simplicity and Bergman's property for unit groups of continuous rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the projective unit group $\mathrm{PGL}(R)$, i.e., the quotient of the unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ modulo its center, of any non-discrete irreducible, continuous ring $R$ is simple. Moreover, we show that $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ has uncountable strong cofinality, that is, it is not the union of a countable chain of proper subgroups and it has finite width with respect to any generating set. Equivalently, every isometric action of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ on a metric space has bounded orbits. It follows that every action of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ by isometries on a non-empty complete $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space admits a fixed point. In particular, $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ possesses Serre's properties $(FH)$ and $(FA)$. Furthermore, our results entail that $\mathrm{PGL}(R)$ has bounded normal generation. In turn, we answer two questions by Carderi and Thom.</description>
