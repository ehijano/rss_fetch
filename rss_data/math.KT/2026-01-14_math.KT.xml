      <title>Spectral Fusion Deformations for Locally Compact Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a deformation framework for $C^*$-algebras equipped with a coaction of a locally compact quantum group, formulated intrinsically at the level of spectral subspaces determined by the coaction. The construction is defined algebraically on a finite spectral core and extended by continuity to a natural Fr\'echet $*$-algebra completion under mild analytic regularity assumptions.
  Deformations are governed by scalar fusion data assigning phases to fusion channels of irreducible corepresentations. Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods.
  At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups. In particular, the framework exhibits explicit associator-level deformations governed by fusion $3$--cocycles that cannot arise from any dual $2$--cocycle or crossed-product construction.</description>

      <title>Real $K$-Theory for $C^*$-Algebras: Just the Facts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is intended to present the basic properties of $KO$-theory for real $C^*$-algebras and to explain its relationship with complex $K$-theory and with $KR$- theory. Whenever possible we will rely upon proofs in printed literature, particularly the work of Karoubi, Wood, Schr\"oder, and more recent work of Boersema and J. M. Rosenberg. In addition, we shall explain how $KO$-theory is related to the Ten-Fold Way in physics and point out how some deeper features of $KO$-theory for operator algebras may provide powerful new tools there. Commutative real $C^*$-algebras not of the form $C(X, R)$ will play a special role.
  Unfortunately, there is no single reference for $KO$-theory for operator algebras that begins to compare with Blackadar's wonderful exposition of complex $K$-theory. This work is intended to provide a platform upon which mathematicians and mathematical physicists can rely in order to use these new tools in their research. As we are writing for a diverse audience of functional analysts, topologists, and physicists, we often present material well-known to one group of people and unfamiliar to another.</description>

      <title>On amplified graph C*-algebras as cores of Cuntz-Krieger algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite directed acyclic graph $R$, we construct from it two graphs $E_R$ and $F_R$, one by adding a loop at every vertex of $R$ and one by replacing every arrow of $R$ by countably infinitely many arrows. We show that the graph C*-algebra $C^*(F_R)$ is isomorphic to the AF core of $C^*(E_R)$. Examples include C*-algebras of a quantum flag manifolds and quantum teardrops. We discuss in detail the quantum Grassmannian $Gr_q(2,4)$ and use our description as AF core to study its CW-structure.</description>
