      <title>Rozenfeld's Geometric Approach to Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rosenfeld's geometric approach to spinors is considered, according to which the coordinates of spinors are represented by the coordinates of the plane generators of the maximal dimension of the absolutes of non-Euclidean spaces. As an example, non-Euclidean spaces with neutral signatures are investigated.</description>

      <title>Action-Driven Flows for Causal Variational Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce action-driven flows for causal variational principles, being a class of non-convex variational problems emanating from applications in fundamental physics. In the compact setting, H\"older continuous curves of measures are constructed by using the method of minimizing movements. As is illustrated in examples, these curves will in general not have a limit point, due to the non-convexity of the action. This leads us to introducing a novel penalization which ensures the existence of a limit point, giving rise to approximate solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations. The methods and results are adapted and generalized to the causal action principle in the finite-dimensional case. As an application, we construct a flow of measures for causal fermion systems in the infinite-dimensional situation.</description>

      <title>Multispecies inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP from antisymmetric fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the recently introduced inhomogeneous $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, a long-range stochastic process on a periodic lattice. A Baxter-type formula is established, expressing the Markov matrix as an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all the fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. This superposition acts as an inclusion-exclusion principle, selectively extracting the sequential particle transitions characteristic of the PushTASEP, while canceling forbidden channels. The homogeneous specialization connects the PushTASEP to ASEP, showing that the two models share eigenstates and a common integrability structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at providing an exact algebro-geometric solution of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation derived from hyperelliptic curves in $4(p+q)-1$ genus. To achieve this goal, we construct the Riemann-Hilbert problems cosponsoring to the mCH equation, which can be solved exactly by the Baker-Akhiezer function. Then the precise expression of the algebro-geometric solution of the mCH equation can be obtained through reconstructed formula.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product in the Category of Effect Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a tensor product in the category of effect algebras and in the category of partially ordered Abelian groups with order unit. We show that the tensor product preserves all the constructions that are essentially colimits over a connected diagram. Further, we prove the construction of a universal group for an effect algebra preserves all tensor products. We establish the corresponding functor from the category of effect algebras to the category of unital Abelian po-groups as a strong monoidal functor. We note that the technique we use in establishing the result could be used in various similar situations. Finally, we show that the tensor product of effect algebras does not preserve the Riesz decomposition property, which was an open question for a while.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal conductivity at integer quantum Hall transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the longitudinal conductivity for a wide class of two-dimensional tight-binding models, whose Hamiltonian displays conical intersections of the Bloch bands at the Fermi level. Our setting allows to consider generic transitions between quantum Hall phases. We obtain an explicit expression for the longitudinal conductivity, completely determined by the number of conical intersections and by the shape of the cones. In particular, the formula reproduces the known quantized values obtained for graphene and for the critical Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Ballistic electron transport described by a fourth order Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fourth order Schr\"odinger equation for the description of charge transport in semiconductors in the ballistic regime is proposed with the inclusion of non parabolic effects in the dispersion relation in order to go beyond the simple effective mass approximation. Similarly to the standard (second order) Schr\"odinger equation, the problem is reduced to a finite spatial domain with appropriate transparent boundary conditions to simulate charge transport in a quantum coupler, where an active region representing an electron device is coupled to leads which take the role of reservoirs. Some analytical properties are investigated and a generalized formula for the current is obtained. Numerical results show the main features of the solutions of the new model. In particular, an effect of interference appears due to a richer wave structure than that arising for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the effective mass approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute scalar products of off-shell Bethe vectors in models with $o_{2n+1}$ symmetry. The scalar products are expressed as a sum over partitions of the Bethe parameter sets, the building blocks being the so-called highest coefficients. We prove some recurrence relations and a residue theorem for these highest coefficients, and prove that they are consistent with the reduction to $gl_n$ invariant models. We also express the norm of on-shell Bethe vectors as a Gaudin determinant.</description>

      <title>Long-time propagation of chaos and exit times for metastable mean-field particle systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of stochastic particles evolving in a multi-well energy landscape and attracted to their barycenter is the prototypical example of mean-field process undergoing phase transitions: at low temperature, the corresponding mean-field deterministic limit has several stationary solutions, and the empirical measure of the particle system is then expected to be a metastable process in the space of probability measures, exhibiting rare transitions between the vicinity of these stationary solutions. We show two results in this direction: first, the exit time from such metastable domains occurs at time exponentially large with the number of particles and follows approximately an exponential distribution; second, up to the expected exit time, the joint law of particles remain close to the law of independent non-linear McKean-Vlasov processes.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish and study the linear canonical Dunkl wavelet transform. We begin by introducing the generalized translation operator and generalized convolution product for the linear canonical Dunkl transform and we establish their basic properties. Next, we introduce the new proposed wavelet transform and we investigate its fundamentals properties.

      <title>Splitting algorithms for paraxial and It\^o-Schr\"odinger models of wave propagation in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a full discretization procedure to solve wave beam propagation in random media modeled by a paraxial wave equation or an It\^o-Schr\"odinger stochastic partial differential equation. This method bears similarities with the phase screen method used routinely to solve such problems. The main axis of propagation is discretized by a centered splitting scheme with step $\Delta z$ while the transverse variables are treated by a spectral method after appropriate spatial truncation. The originality of our approach is its theoretical validity even when the typical wavelength $\theta$ of the propagating signal satisfies $\theta\ll\Delta z$. More precisely, we obtain a convergence of order $\Delta z$ in mean-square sense while the errors on statistical moments are of order $(\Delta z)^2$ as expected for standard centered splitting schemes. This is a surprising result as splitting schemes typically do not converge when $\Delta z$ is not the smallest scale of the problem. The analysis is based on equations satisfied by statistical moments in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger case and on integral (Duhamel) expansions for the paraxial model. Several numerical simulations illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Quantitative relaxation dynamics from generic initial configurations in the inertial Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics of the inertial Kuramoto model toward a phase-locked state from a generic initial phase configuration. For this, we propose a sufficient framework in terms of initial data and system parameters for asymptotic phase-locking. It can be roughly stated as set of conditions such as a positive initial order parameter, a coupling strength sufficiently larger than initial frequency diameter and intrinsic frequency diameter, but less than the inverse of inertia. Under the proposed framework, generic initial configuration undergoes three dynamic stages (initial layer, condensation and relaxation stages) before it reaches a phase-locked state asymptotically. The first stage is the initial layer stage in analogy with fluid mechanics, during which the effect of the initial natural frequency distribution is dominant, compared to that of the sinusoidal coupling between oscillators. The second stage is the condensation stage, during which the order parameter increases, and at the end of which a majority cluster is contained in a sufficiently small arc. Finally, the third stage is the persistence and relaxation stage, during which the majority cluster remains stable (persistence) and the total configuration relaxes toward a phase-locked state asymptotically (relaxation). The intricate proof involves with several key tools such as the quasi-monotonicity of the order parameter (for the condensation stage), a nonlinear Gr\"onwall inequality on the diameter of the majority cluster (for the persistence stage), and a variant of the classical {\L}ojasiewicz gradient theorem (for the relaxation stage).</description>

Abstract: We study $q$-deformation of the probability measure on partitions, i.e., $q$-deformed random partitions. We in particular consider the $q$-Plancherel measure and show a determinantal formula for the correlation function using a $q$-deformation of the discrete Bessel kernel. We also investigate Riemann-Hilbert problems associated with the corresponding orthogonal polynomials and obtain $q$-Painlev{\'e} equations from the $q$-difference Lax formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to find closed form solutions of nonintegrable nonlinear ordinary differential equations, numerous tricks have been proposed. The goal of this short review is to recall classical, 19th-century results, completed in 2006 by Eremenko, which can be turned into algorithms, thus avoiding \textit{ad hoc} assumptions, able to provide \textit{all} (as opposed to some) solutions in a precise class. To illustrate these methods, we present some new such exact solutions, physically relevent.</description>

      <title>Probability of Transition to Turbulence in a Reduced Stochastic Model of Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of turbulence initiation in pipe flow under different noise structures by estimating the probability of initiating metastable transitions. We establish lower bounds on turbulence transition probabilities using linearized models with multiplicative noise near the laminar state. First, we consider the case of stochastic perturbations by It\^o white noise; then, through the Stratonovich interpretation, we extend the analysis to noise types such as white and red noise in time. Our findings demonstrate the viability of detecting the onset of turbulence as rare events under diverse noise assumptions. The results also contribute to applied SPDE theory and offer valuable methodologies for understanding turbulence across application areas.</description>

      <title>Regularizations for shock and rarefaction waves in the perturbed solitons of the KP equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of an asymptotic perturbation method, we study the initial value problem of the KP equation with initial data consisting of parts of exact line-soliton solutions of the equation. We consider a slow modulation of the soliton parameters, which is described by a dynamical system obtained by the perturbation method. The system is given by a quasi-linear system, and in particular, we show that a singular solution ({shock wave}) leads to a generation of new soliton as a result of resonant interaction of solitons. We also show that a regular solution corresponding to a rarefaction wave can be described by a parabola (we call it {parabolic}-soliton). We then perform numerical simulations of the initial value problem and show that they are in excellent agreement with the results obtained by the perturbation method.</description>

      <title>On a hyperbolic Duffing oscillator with linear damping and periodic forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Duffing oscillator describes the dynamics of a mass suspended on a spring with position-dependent stiffness. The mass is assumed to experience a linear damping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental in theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with parity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two metastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include nonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis circuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated conformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work we consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented by a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential has two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability parameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of the equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In the absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of anharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types. However, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical solutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described by Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into consideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases or vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply varying the deformability parameter. The Poincar\'e map of the proposed model carries the well-known characteristic signatures of chaos presursors of the standard Duffing model, which happens to be just a particular case of the bistable oscillator model with the hyperbolic double-well potential.</description>

      <title>Change of basis for the tridiagonal pairs of type II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tridiagonal pairs of type II. These involve two linear transformations $A$ and $A^\star$. We define two bases. In the first one, $A$ acts as a diagonal matrix while $A^\star$ acts as a block tridiagonal matrix, and in the second one, $A$ acts as a block tridiagonal matrix while $A^\star$ acts as a diagonal matrix. We obtain the change of basis coefficients between these two bases. The coefficients are special functions that are written as a nested product of polynomials that resemble Racah polynomials but involve shift operators in their expression.</description>

Abstract: We show the analogue of the Serre-Swan theorem in a context of supergeometry. This theorem gives an equivalence of the category of locally free supersheaves of bounded rank over locally ringed superspace with the category of finitely generated super projective modules over its coordinate superring, under the assumptions that every locally free supersheaf is generated by global sections and it is acyclic.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems and lack thereof for a multilayer random walk mimicking human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a continuous-time random walk model on an infinite multilayer structure inspired by transportation networks. Each layer is a copy of $\mathbb{R}^d$, indexed by a non-negative integer. A walker moves within a layer by means of an inertial displacement whose speed is a deterministic function of the layer index and whose direction and duration are random, but with a timescale that depends on the layer. After each inertial displacement, the walker may randomly shift level, up or down, independently of its past. The multilayer structure is hierarchical, in the sense that the speed is a nondecreasing function of the layer index. Our primary focus is on the diffusive properties of the system. Under a natural condition on the parameters of the model, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the $\mathbb{R}^d$-coordinate of the process. By contrast, in a class of examples where this condition is violated, we are able to determine the correct scaling of the process while proving that no limit theorem holds.</description>

      <title>Partition Functions of Determinantal Point Processes on Polarized K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>

      <title>Cosmological phase-space analysis of $f(G)$-theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01620v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of topological terms that modify the Hilbert-Einstein action is here explored by virtue of a further $f(G)$ contribution. In particular, we investigate the phase-space stability and critical points of an equivalent scalar field representation that makes use of a massive field, whose potential is function of the topological correction. To do so, we introduce to the gravitational Action Integral a Lagrange multiplier and model the modified Friedmann equations by virtue of new non-dimensional variables. We single out dimensionless variables that permit \emph{a priori} the Hubble rate change of sign, enabling regions in which the Hubble parameter either vanishes or becomes negative. In this respect, we thus analyze the various possibilities associated with a universe characterized by such topological contributions and find the attractors, saddle points and regions of stability, in general. The overall analysis is carried out considering the exponential potential first and then shifting to more complicated cases, where the underlying variables do not simplify. We compute the eigenvalues of our coupled differential equations and, accordingly, the stability of the system, in both a spatially-flat and non-flat universe. Quite remarkably, regardless of the spatial curvature, we show that a stable de Sitter-like phase that can model current time appears only a small fraction of the entire phase-space, suggesting that the model under exam is unlikely in describing the whole universe dynamics, i.e., the topological terms appear disfavored in framing the entire evolution of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we rigorously derive the fundamental PDEs of fluid mechanics, such as the compressible Euler and incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, starting from the hard sphere particle systems undergoing elastic collisions. This resolves Hilbert's sixth problem, as it pertains to the program of deriving the fluid equations from Newton's laws by way of Boltzmann's kinetic theory. The proof relies on the derivation of Boltzmann's equation on 2D and 3D tori, which is an extension of our previous work (arXiv:2408.07818).</description>

In addition, results of rigorous analysis of the behaviour of these solutions when the time tends to infinity and when the small parameter tends to zero are cited.

Abstract: We study the BCS critical temperature on half-spaces in dimensions $d=1,2,3$ with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that the critical temperature on a half-space is strictly higher than on $\mathbb{R}^d$, at least at weak coupling in $d=1,2$ and weak coupling and small chemical potential in $d=3$. Furthermore, we show that the relative shift in critical temperature vanishes in the weak coupling limit.</description>

      <title>The Symplectic Schur Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a measure on tuples of partitions, called the symplectic Schur process, that should be regarded as the right analogue of the Schur process of Okounkov-Reshetikhin for the Cartan type C. The weights of our measure include factors that are universal symplectic characters, as well as a novel family of "Down-Up Schur functions" that we define and for which we prove new identities of Cauchy-Littlewood-type. Our main structural result is that the point process corresponding to the symplectic Schur process is determinantal and we find an explicit correlation kernel. We also present dynamics that preserve the family of symplectic Schur processes and explore an alternative sampling scheme, based on the Berele insertion algorithm, in a special case. Finally, we study the asymptotics of the Berele insertion process and find explicit formulas for the limit shape and fluctuations near the bulk and the edge. One of the limit regimes leads to a new kernel that resembles the symmetric Pearcey kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Often, when we consider the time evolution of a system, we resort to approximation: Instead of calculating the exact orbit, we divide the time interval in question into uniform segments. Chernoff's results in this direction provide us with a general approximation scheme. There are situations when we need to break the interval into uneven pieces. In this paper, we explore alternative conditions to the one found by Smolyanov et al. such that Chernoff's original result can be extended to unevenly distributed time intervals. Two applications concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics and the central limit theorem are presented.</description>

Abstract: Consider the $n\times n$ matrix $X_n=A_n+H_n$, where $A_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix (either deterministic or random) and $H_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix independent from $A_n$ drawn from complex Ginibre ensemble. We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$. In arXiv:0807.4898 it was shown that the eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$ converges to some deterministic measure. This measure is known for the case $A_n=0$. Under some general convergence conditions on $A_n$ we prove a formula for the density of the limiting measure. We also obtain an estimation on the rate of convergence of the distribution. The approach used here is based on supersymmetric integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we provide a new solution of the classical black box problem (the discrete Calderon problem) in the theory of circular electrical networks. Our approach is based on the explicit embedding of electrical networks into non-negative Grassmannians and generalized chamber ansatz for it. Additionally, we reveal the relationship of this problem with combinatorial properties of spanning groves and the theory of the totally non-negative matrices.

      <title>A notion of fractality for a class of states and noncommutative relative distance zeta functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we first recall the definition of the relative distance zeta function in [36, 37, 38, 40, 41] and slightly generalize this notion from sets to probability measures, and then move on to propose a novel definition a relative distance (and tube) zeta functional for a class of states over a C* algebra. With such an extension, we look into the chance to define relative Minkowski dimensions in this context, and explore the notion of fractality for this class of states. Relative complex dimensions as poles of this newly proposed relative distance zeta functional, as well as its geometric and transformation properties, decomposition rules and properties that respects tensor products are discussed. We then explore some examples that possess fractal properties with this new zeta functional and propose functional equations similar to [9].</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d&gt;4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider spread-out models of the self-avoiding walk and its finite-memory version, known as the memory-$\tau$ walk, which prohibits loops whose length is at most $\tau$, in dimensions $d&gt;4$. The critical point is defined as the radius of convergence of the generating function for each model. It is known that the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ walk is non-decreasing in $\tau$ and converges to that of the self-avoiding walk as $\tau$ tends to infinity. In this paper, we study the rate at which the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ walk converges to that of the self-avoiding walk and show that the order is $\tau^{-(d-2)/2}$. The proof relies on the lace expansion, introduced by Brydges and Spencer.</description>

      <title>New Revival Phenomena for Bidirectional Dispersive Hyperbolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the dispersive revival and fractalization phenomena for bidirectional dispersive equations on a bounded interval subject to periodic boundary conditions and discontinuous initial profiles are investigated. Firstly, we study the periodic initial-boundary value problem of the linear beam equation with step function initial data, and analyze the manifestation of the revival phenomenon for the corresponding solution at rational times. Next, we extend the investigation to periodic initial-boundary value problems of more general bidirectional dispersive equations. We prove that, if the initial functions are of bounded variation, the dynamical evolution of such periodic problems depend essentially upon the large wave number asymptotics of the associated dispersion relations. Integral polynomial or asymptotically integral polynomial dispersion relations produce dispersive revival/fractalization rational/irrational dichotomies, whereas those with non-polynomial growth result in fractal profiles at all times. Finally, numerical experiments, in the concrete case of the nonlinear beam equation, are used to demonstrate how such effects persist into the nonlinear regime.</description>

      <title>Quadratic and cubic Gaudin Hamiltonians and super Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for general linear Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that under a generic condition, the quadratic Gaudin Hamiltonians associated to $\mathfrak{gl}(p+m|q+n)$ are diagonalizable on any singular weight space in any tensor product of unitarizable highest weight $\mathfrak{gl}(p+m|q+n)$-modules. Moreover, every joint eigenbasis of the Hamiltonians can be obtained from some joint eigenbasis of the quadratic Gaudin Hamiltonians for the general linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(r+k)$ on the corresponding singular weight space in the tensor product of some finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{gl}(r+ k)$-modules for $r$ and $k$ sufficiently large. After specializing to $p=q=0$, we show that similar results hold as well for the cubic Gaudin Hamiltonians associated to $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$.
  We also relate the set of singular solutions of the (super) Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for $\mathfrak{gl}(p+m|q+n)$ to the set of singular solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for $\mathfrak{gl}(r+k)$ for $r$ and $k$ sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Global $\mathcal{L}^2$ minimization at uniform exponential rate via geometrically adapted gradient descent in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15487v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of supervised learning in Deep Learning (DL) networks, and exploit the arbitrariness of choice in the Riemannian metric relative to which the gradient descent flow can be defined (a general fact of differential geometry). In the standard approach to DL, the gradient flow on the space of parameters (weights and biases) is defined with respect to the Euclidean metric. Here instead, we choose the gradient flow with respect to the Euclidean metric in the output layer of the DL network. This naturally induces two modified versions of the gradient descent flow in the parameter space, one adapted for the overparametrized setting, and the other for the underparametrized setting. In the overparametrized case, we prove that, provided that a rank condition holds, all orbits of the modified gradient descent drive the ${\mathcal L}^2$ cost to its global minimum at a uniform exponential convergence rate; one thereby obtains an a priori stopping time for any prescribed proximity to the global minimum. We point out relations of the latter to sub-Riemannian geometry. Moreover, we generalize the above framework to the situation in which the rank condition does not hold; in particular, we show that local equilibria can only exist if a rank loss occurs, and that generically, they are not isolated points, but elements of a critical submanifold of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Feigenbaum universality in subcritical Taylor-Couette flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feigenbaum universality is shown to occur in subcritical shear flows. Our testing ground is the counter-rotation regime of the Taylor-Couette flow, where numerical calculations are performed within a small periodic domain. The accurate computation of up to the seventh period doubling bifurcation, assisted by a purposely defined Poincar\'e section, has enabled us to reproduce the two Feigenbaum universal constants with unprecedented accuracy in a fluid flow problem. We have further devised a method to predict the bifurcation diagram up to the accumulation point of the cascade based on the detailed inspection of just the first few period doubling bifurcations. Remarkably, the method is applicable beyond the accumulation point, with predictions remaining valid, in a statistical sense, for the chaotic dynamics that follows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a fully discrete analog of the massive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates by constructing its Lax-pair representation. This Lax-pair representation can also be used to define a new Yang-Baxter map, so we obtain a Yang-Baxter map that admits a continuous limit. We present most of the results for the general case where the dependent variables are matrix-valued.</description>

      <title>Optimal solutions employing an algebraic Variational Multiscale approach Part I: Steady Linear Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends our previous study from S. Shrestha et al. (2024) by introducing a new abstract framework for Variational Multiscale (VMS) methods at the discrete level. We introduce the concept of what we define as the optimal projector and present a discretisation approach that yields a numerical solution closely approximating the optimal projection of the infinite-dimensional continuous solution. In this approach, the infinite-dimensional unresolved scales are approximated in a finite-dimensional subspace using the numerically computed Fine-Scale Greens' function of the underlying symmetric problem. The proposed approach involves solving the VMS problem on two separate meshes: a coarse mesh for the full PDE and a fine mesh for the symmetric part of the continuous differential operator. We consider the 1D and 2D steady advection-diffusion problems in both direct and mixed formulations as the test cases in this paper. We first present an error analysis of the proposed approach and show that the projected solution is achieved as the approximate Greens' function converges to the exact one. Subsequently, we demonstrate the working of this method where we show that it can exponentially converge to the chosen optimal projection. We note that the implementation of the present work employs the Mimetic Spectral Element Method (MSEM), although, it may be applied to other Finite/Spectral Element or Isogeometric frameworks. Furthermore, we propose that VMS should not be viewed as a stabilisation technique; instead, the base scheme should be inherently stable, with VMS enhancing the solution quality by supplementing the base scheme.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</description>

      <title>From $G_2$ to $SO(8)$: Emergence and reminiscence of supersymmetry and triality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry $G_2$. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable $SO(8)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three $SO(7)$ critical ones, a $G_2$ critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three $SO(7)$ critical phases correspond to different $SO(7)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The $G_2$ critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges $c=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{7}{10}$, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two $SO(7)$ symmetries and the supersymmetric $G_2$ critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.</description>

      <title>Zero Mass limit of Kerr-MOG Black Hole Equals Wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued in existing literature that the zero mass limit of Kerr spacetime corresponds to either flat Minkowski spacetime or a wormhole exhibiting a locally flat geometry. In this study, we examine that the zero mass limit of the Kerr-MOG black hole is equivalent to a wormhole. Moreover, we derive the Kerr-Schild form of the Kerr-MOG black hole through specific coordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological characteristics of the Kerr-MOG black hole within the framework of modified gravity. Our analysis also includes a discussion of the wormhole using cylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the Kerr-Newman black hole and show that the \emph{zero mass limit of the Kerr-Newman black hole does not yield a wormhole}. However, if we impose an additional criterion such that \emph{both the mass parameter and the charge parameters are equal to zero}, then the Kerr-Newman black hole will be a wormhole.</description>

      <title>Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</description>

      <title>Flipping qudits: Extending the Bit-Flip Channel to higher-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present three possible extensions of the bit-flip channel to qutrit systems based on the diverse interpretations of the channel. Also, we extended them to higher-dimensional qudit systems, formulating different versions of dit flip channels. Finally, we studied their impact on the Negativity, as an entanglement measure, of qubit-qutrit and 2-qutrit Werner states. In doing so, we showed the inequivalence of these versions as they affect in very distinct ways the states entanglement.</description>

      <title>Dark states in an integrable XY central spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstates of central spin models in which the central spin is unentangled with the environment are known as dark states. They have recently been observed in a class of integrable XX models. Here we find that dark states are present in XY models, but only for particular configurations of the central spin magnetic field. We show this via an explicit construction of the Bethe states.</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain the structure of proof of our results on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Spreading and Memory Retention Under Power Law Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power law potentials dictate interactions across scales and matter, controlling the structure and dynamics of inanimate, and living systems. Though the equilibrium distributions of particles with a power law repulsion were extensively studied, their unconfined dynamical evolution gained far less attention -- Yet, living matter is inherently out of equilibrium and is seldom static. Here, we investigate the overdamped dynamic spreading of a dense suspension of particles under repulsive pair-potential of the form $1/r^k$. Coarse graining the pair interactions, we predict that the suspension spreads in a self-similar form, with its radius growing in time as $t^{1/(k+2)}$, independent of the spatial dimension ($d$). We confirm this prediction experimentally in quasi-two dimensions using perpendicularly magnetized colloids with dipolar repulsion ($k=3$). Numerical simulations corroborate the experiments for the $k=3$ case and further predict a categorically different behavior at a critical power law: when $k&lt;d-2$, the initial distribution is no longer concentrated at the origin. Instead, particles accumulate at the perimeter and retain a long-lived memory of their original pattern. We demonstrate that below this threshold, the initial distribution seeds the resulting pattern, encoding the future structure of an unconfined, and dynamically evolving system.</description>

      <title>Mixed Berndt-Type Integrals and Generalized Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and study four families of Berndt-type integrals, called mixed Berndt-type integrals, which contains (hyperbolic) sine and cosine functions in the integrand function. By contour integration, these integrals are first converted to some hyperbolic (infinite) sums of Ramanujan type, all of which can be calculated in closed forms by comparing both the Fourier series expansions and the Maclaurin series expansions of a few Jacobi elliptic functions. These sums can be expressed as rational polynomials of {\Gamma}(1/4) and {\pi}^{-1} which give rise to the closed formulas of the mixed Berndt-type integrals we are interested in. Moreover, we also present some interesting consequences and illustrative examples. Further, we define a generalized Barnes multiple zeta function, and find a classic integral representation of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Furthermore, we give an alternative evaluation of the mixed Berndt-type integrals in terms of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Finally, we obtain some direct evaluations of rational linear combinations of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>
