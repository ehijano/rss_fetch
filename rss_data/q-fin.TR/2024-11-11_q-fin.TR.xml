      <title>Enhancing literature review with LLM and NLP methods. Algorithmic trading case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and organize knowledge in the field of algorithmic trading. By filtering a dataset of 136 million research papers, we identified 14,342 relevant articles published between 1956 and Q1 2020. We compare traditional practices-such as keyword-based algorithms and embedding techniques-with state-of-the-art topic modeling methods that employ dimensionality reduction and clustering. This comparison allows us to assess the popularity and evolution of different approaches and themes within algorithmic trading. We demonstrate the usefulness of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the automatic extraction of knowledge, highlighting the new possibilities created by the latest iterations of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The rationale for focusing on this topic stems from our analysis, which reveals that research articles on algorithmic trading are increasing at a faster rate than the overall number of publications. While stocks and main indices comprise more than half of all assets considered, certain asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies, exhibit a much stronger growth trend. Machine learning models have become the most popular methods in recent years. The study demonstrates the efficacy of LLMs in refining datasets and addressing intricate questions about the analyzed articles, such as comparing the efficiency of different models. Our research shows that by decomposing tasks into smaller components and incorporating reasoning steps, we can effectively tackle complex questions supported by case analyses. This approach contributes to a deeper understanding of algorithmic trading methodologies and underscores the potential of advanced NLP techniques in literature reviews.</description>

      <title>No Tick-Size Too Small: A General Method for Modelling Small Tick Limit Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tick sizes not only influence the granularity of the price formation process but also affect market agents' behavior. We investigate the disparity in the microstructural properties of the Limit Order Book (LOB) across different relative tick sizes. A key contribution of this study is the identification of several stylized facts, which are used to differentiate between large, medium, and small tick stocks, along with clear metrics for their measurement. We provide cross-asset visualizations to illustrate how these attributes vary with relative tick size. Further, we propose a Hawkes Process model that accounts for sparsity, multi-tick level price moves, and the shape of the book in small-tick stocks. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the universality of the model and identify key variables that determine whether a simulated LOB resembles a large-tick or small-tick stock. Our tests show that stylized facts like sparsity, shape, and relative returns distribution can be smoothly transitioned from a large-tick to a small-tick asset using our model. We test this model's assumptions, showcase its challenges and propose questions for further directions in this area of research.</description>
