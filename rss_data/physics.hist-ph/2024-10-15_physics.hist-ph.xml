      <title>Tensorial Quantum Mechanics: Back to Heisenberg and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the establishment of Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM) developed through Schr\"odinger's and Dirac's wave-vectorial reformulations of Heisenberg's original matrix mechanics. We will argue that while Heisenberg's approach was consistently developed -- taking as a standpoint the intensive patterns that were observed in the lab -- as an invariant-operational formalism, Dirac's axiomatic re-formulation was, instead, developed -- taking as a standpoint Schr\"odinger's wave mechanics and the methodological guide of Bohr and logical positivists -- as an essentially inconsistent "recipe" intended (but unable) to predict (binary) measurement outcomes. Leaving SQM behind and attempting to restore the consistent and coherent account of a real state of affairs, we will present a new tensorial proposal which -- taking as a standpoint Heisenberg's original approach -- will prove capable not only to extend the matrix formalism to a tensorial representation but also to account for new experimental phenomena.</description>

      <title>Some singular spacetimes and their possible alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a brief review article of a seminar given at the International Conference on Gravitation, Astrophysics and Cosmology 2024 (ICGAC-2024), Mathura, India. We begin with a historical survey of some singular solutions in the theory of gravitation, as well as a very brief discussion of how black holes could physically form. Some possible scenarios which could perhaps eliminate these singularities are then reviewed and discussed. Due to the vastness of the field the coverage is not exhaustive, but instead the concentration is on a small subset of topics such as possible quantum gravity effects, non-commutative geometry, and gravastars. A simple singularity theorem is also presented in the appendix. Although parts of the manuscript assume some familiarity with relativistic gravitation or differential geometry, the aim is for the broad picture to be accessible to non-specialists of other physical sciences and mathematics.</description>
