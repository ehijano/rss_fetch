      <title>Itinerant A-type Antiferromagnetic Order in Co$_{0.25}$TaSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the magnetic behavior and resulting transport properties of TaSe$_2$ when intercalated by magnetically active cobalt cations. Acting as the layered host, TaSe$_2$ is a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) that adopts the 2H-polytype. We find through our single crystal and powder diffraction studies that we can prepare the stoichiometry Co$_{0.25}$TaSe$_2$, which crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group $P6_3/mmc$. From magnetic susceptibility and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, we find a transition consistent with antiferromagnetic order below the temperature $T_N$ = 173 K and Co$^{2+}$ in the high-spin state. Neutron powder diffraction and specific heat measurements, however, point to a much smaller than anticipated ordered moment in this sample. From the neutron results, the magnetic structure can be described as an A-type antiferromagnet with an ordered moment size of 1.35(11) $\mu_B$ per Co cation. The direction of the moments are all long the c-axis, which is consistent with the magnetization and susceptibility studies showing this direction to be the easy axis. Interestingly, we find that a weak and subtle ferromagnetic component appears to exist along the $ab$-plane of the Co$_{0.25}$TaSe$_2$ crystals. We place the results of this work in the context of other magnetic-ion intercalated TMDs, especially those of Ta and Nb.</description>

      <title>Number-operator-based inverse engineering technique in a two level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper experimentally realize a new method for shortcuts to adiabaticity, number operator based inverse engineering method (NOBIE), using quantum computers built with transmon qubits. Digitized control pulses are programmed in an open source software development kit, qiskit, to execute the shortcut protocols. The obtained results shows the robustness of the NOBIE method, even though it is tested for an effective Hamiltonian of a qubit irrespective of the interaction with other qubits and noise associated with the control pulses.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature cavity exciton-polariton condensation in perovskite quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploitation of the strong light-matter coupling regime and exciton-polariton condensates has emerged as a compelling approach to introduce strong interactions and nonlinearities into numerous photonic applications, ranging from low-threshold topological lasers to ultrafast all-optical logic devices. The use of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots with strong three-dimensional confinement as the active material in these microcavities would be highly advantageous due to their versatile structural and compositional tunability and wet-chemical processability, as well as potentially enhanced, confinement-induced polaritonic interactions. Yet, to date, cavity exciton-polariton condensation has neither been achieved with epitaxial nor with colloidal quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature polariton condensation in a thin film of monodisperse, colloidal CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots placed in a tunable optical resonator with a Gaussian-shaped deformation serving as wavelength-scale potential well for the polaritons. The onset of polariton condensation under pulsed optical excitation is manifested in emission by its characteristic superlinear intensity dependence, reduced linewidth, blueshift, and extended temporal coherence. Our results, based on this highly engineerable class of perovskite materials with unique optical properties, pave the way for the development of polaritonic devices for ultrabright coherent light sources and photonic information processing.</description>

      <title>Edge modes, extended TQFT, and measurement based quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>
