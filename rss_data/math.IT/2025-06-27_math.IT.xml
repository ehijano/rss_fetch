      <title>Entropic additive energy and entropy inequalities for sums and products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a growing number of studies that, over the past 15 years, have established entropy inequalities via ideas and tools from additive combinatorics, in this work we obtain a number of new bounds for the differential entropy of sums, products, and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. Partly motivated by recent work by Goh on the discrete entropic version of the notion of "additive energy", we introduce the additive energy of pairs of continuous random variables and prove various versions of the statement that "the additive energy is large if and only if the entropy of the sum is small", along with a version of the Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem for differential entropy. Then, motivated in part by recent work by M\'ath\'e and O'Regan, we establish a series of new differential entropy inequalities for products and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. In particular, we prove a new, general, ring Pl\"unnecke-Ruzsa entropy inequality. We briefly return to the case of discrete entropy and provide a characterization of discrete random variables with "large doubling", analogous to Tao's Freiman-type inverse sumset theory for the case of small doubling. Finally, we consider the natural entropic analog of the Erd\"os-Szemer\'edi sum-product phenomenon for integer-valued random variables. We show that, if it does hold, then the range of parameters for which it does would necessarily be significantly more restricted than its anticipated combinatorial counterpart.</description>

      <title>Constant Modulus Waveforms for IoT-Centric Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is considered a key enabler to support application scenarios such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) in which both communications and sensing play significant roles. Multi-carrier waveforms, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), have been considered as good candidates for ISAC due to their high communications data rate and good time bandwidth property for sensing. Nevertheless, their high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) values lead to either performance degradation or an increase in system complexity. This can make OFDM unsuitable for IoT applications with insufficient resources in terms of power, system complexity, hardware size or cost. This article provides IoT-centric constant modulus waveform designs that leverage the advantage of unit PAPR and thus are more suitable in resource-limited scenarios. More specifically, several single-carrier frequency and/or phase-modulated waveforms are considered. A comprehensive discussion on their radar sensing and communications performance is conducted based on performance metrics, including the radar ambiguity function, the bandwidth property, the data rate, and the communications receiver complexity.</description>

      <title>Semantic-aware Digital Twin for AI-based CSI Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) substantially enhances channel state information (CSI) acquisition performance but is limited by its reliance on single-modality information and deployment challenges, particularly in dataset collection. This paper investigates the use of semantic-aware digital twin (DT) to enhance AI-based CSI acquisition. We first briefly introduce the motivation and recent advancements in AI-driven CSI acquisition and semantic-aware DT employment for air interfaces. Then, we thoroughly explore how semantic-aware DT can bolster AI-based CSI acquisition. We categorizes the semantic-aware DT for AI-based CSI acquisition into two classes: enhancing AI-based CSI acquisition through integration with DT and using DT to aid AI-based CSI deployment. Potential integration frameworks are introduced in detail. Finally, we conclude by outlining potential research directions within the semantic-aware DT-assisted AI-based CSI acquisition.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Aware Two-Stage Method for Fast Iterative MIMO Detection in LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a cluster-aware two-stage multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection method is proposed for direct-to-cell satellite communications. The method achieves computational efficiency by exploiting a distinctive property of satellite MIMO channels: users within the same geographical cluster exhibit highly correlated channel characteristics due to their physical proximity, which typically impedes convergence in conventional iterative MIMO detectors. The proposed method implements a two-stage strategy that first eliminates intra-cluster interference using computationally efficient small matrix inversions, then utilizes these pre-computed matrices to accelerate standard iterative MIMO detectors such as Gauss-Seidel (GS) and symmetric successive over-relaxation (SSOR) for effective inter-cluster interference cancellation. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more than 12 times faster convergence under perfect channel state information. Even when accounting for channel estimation errors, the method maintains 9 times faster convergence, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness for next-generation satellite MIMO communications.</description>

      <title>Optimal Single-Policy Sample Complexity and Transient Coverage for Average-Reward Offline RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy, specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs, contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy, distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Shallow Transformers for Wireless Symbol Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems, particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space, CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2 layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models, making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Balancing Privacy and Utility in Correlated Data: A Study of Bayesian Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy risks in differentially private (DP) systems increase significantly when data is correlated, as standard DP metrics often underestimate the resulting privacy leakage, leaving sensitive information vulnerable. Given the ubiquity of dependencies in real-world databases, this oversight poses a critical challenge for privacy protections. Bayesian differential privacy (BDP) extends DP to account for these correlations, yet current BDP mechanisms indicate notable utility loss, limiting its adoption.
  In this work, we address whether BDP can be realistically implemented in common data structures without sacrificing utility -- a key factor for its applicability. By analyzing arbitrary and structured correlation models, including Gaussian multivariate distributions and Markov chains, we derive practical utility guarantees for BDP. Our contributions include theoretical links between DP and BDP and a novel methodology for adapting DP mechanisms to meet the BDP requirements. Through evaluations on real-world databases, we demonstrate that our novel theorems enable the design of BDP mechanisms that maintain competitive utility, paving the way for practical privacy-preserving data practices in correlated settings.</description>

      <title>Linear codes arising from the point-hyperplane geometry-Part I: the Segre embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements and $\Lambda$ be the image of the Segre geometry $\mathrm{PG}(V)\otimes\mathrm{PG}(V^*)$ in $\mathrm{PG}(V\otimes V^*)$. Consider the subvariety $\Lambda_{1}$ of $\Lambda$ represented by the pure tensors $x\otimes \xi$ with $x\in V$ and $\xi\in V^*$ such that $\xi(x)=0$. Regarding $\Lambda_1$ as a projective system of $\mathrm{PG}(V\otimes V^*)$, we study the linear code $\mathcal{C}(\Lambda_1)$ arising from it. The code $\mathcal{C}(\Lambda_1)$ is minimal code and we determine its basic parameters, itsfull weight list and its linear automorphism group. We also give a geometrical characterization of its minimum and second lowest weight codewords as well as of some of the words of maximum weight.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Bounds for Persistent Laplacian Eigenvalues under One-Simplex Insertions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology, physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle, is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools, including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound: after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis. It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.</description>

      <title>Succinct Preferential Attachment Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing over compressed data combines the space saving of data compression with efficient support for queries directly on the compressed representation. Such data structures are widely applied in text indexing and have been successfully generalised to trees. For graphs, support for computing over compressed data remains patchy; typical results in the area of succinct data structures are restricted to a specific class of graphs and use the same, worst-case amount of space for any graph from this class.
  In this work, we design a data structure whose space usage automatically improves with the compressibility of the graph at hand, while efficiently supporting navigational operations (simulating adjacency-list access). Specifically, we show that the space usage approaches the instance-optimal space when the graph is drawn according to the classic Barab\'asi-Albert model of preferential-attachment graphs. Our data-structure techniques also work for arbitrary graphs, guaranteeing a size asymptotically no larger than an entropy-compressed edge list. A key technical contribution is the careful analysis of the instance-optimal space usage.</description>

      <title>Detecting weighted hidden cliques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the classical hidden clique problem to graphs with real-valued edge weights. Formally, we define a hypothesis testing problem. Under the null hypothesis, edges of a complete graph on $n$ vertices are associated with independent and identically distributed edge weights from a distribution $P$. Under the alternate hypothesis, $k$ vertices are chosen at random and the edge weights between them are drawn from a distribution $Q$, while the remaining are sampled from $P$. The goal is to decide, upon observing the edge weights, which of the two hypotheses they were generated from. We investigate the problem under two different scenarios: (1) when $P$ and $Q$ are completely known, and (2) when there is only partial information of $P$ and $Q$. In the first scenario, we obtain statistical limits on $k$ when the two hypotheses are distinguishable, and when they are not. Additionally, in each of the scenarios, we provide bounds on the minimal risk of the hypothesis testing problem when $Q$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to $P$. We also provide computationally efficient spectral tests that can distinguish the two hypotheses as long as $k=\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ in both the scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Strong Converse Exponent of the Classical Soft Covering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the exact strong converse exponent of the soft covering problem in the classical setting. This exponent characterizes the slowest achievable convergence speed of the total variation to one when a code of rate below mutual information is applied to a discrete memoryless channel for synthesizing a product output distribution. The proposed exponent is expressed through a new two-parameter quantity, differing from the more commonly studied R\'enyi divergence or R\'enyi mutual information, both of which have a single parameter and frequently appear in the literature of error exponents. Additionally, we provide a random coding achievability bound that takes the typical form involving the R\'enyi mutual information, but it is not tight in general in the strong converse regime of the classical soft covering problem.</description>

      <title>Anonymous Shamir's Secret Sharing via Reed-Solomon Codes Against Permutations, Insertions, and Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the performance of Reed-Solomon codes against an adversary that first permutes the symbols of the codeword and then performs insertions and deletions. This adversarial model is motivated by the recent interest in fully anonymous secret-sharing schemes [EBG+24],[BGI+24]. A fully anonymous secret-sharing scheme has two key properties: (1) the identities of the participants are not revealed before the secret is reconstructed, and (2) the shares of any unauthorized set of participants are uniform and independent. In particular, the shares of any unauthorized subset reveal no information about the identity of the participants who hold them.
  In this work, we first make the following observation: Reed-Solomon codes that are robust against an adversary that permutes the codeword and then deletes symbols from the permuted codeword can be used to construct ramp threshold secret-sharing schemes that are fully anonymous. Then, we show that over large enough fields of size, there are $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon codes that are robust against an adversary that arbitrary permutes the codeword and then performs $n-2k+1$ insertions and deletions to the permuted codeword. This implies the existence of a $(k-1, 2k-1, n)$ ramp secret sharing scheme that is fully anonymous. That is, any $k-1$ shares reveal nothing about the secret, and, moreover, this set of shares reveals no information about the identities of the players who hold them. On the other hand, any $2k-1$ shares can reconstruct the secret without revealing their identities. We also provide explicit constructions of such schemes based on previous works on Reed-Solomon codes correcting insertions and deletions. The constructions in this paper give the first gap threshold secret-sharing schemes that satisfy the strongest notion of anonymity together with perfect reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Signal Recovery on Algebraic Varieties Using Linear Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recovery of an unknown signal from its linear measurements is a fundamental problem spanning numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. Commonly, prior knowledge suggests that the underlying signal resides within a known algebraic variety. This context naturally leads to a question: what is the minimum number of measurements required to uniquely recover any signal belonging to such an algebraic variety? In this survey paper, we introduce a method that leverages tools from algebraic geometry to address this question. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to two problems: phase retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery. We also highlight several open problems, which could serve as a basis for future investigations in this field.</description>

Abstract: We characterize exact, and approximate, optimality of games that players can interact with using quantum strategies. In comparison to a previous work of the author, arXiv: 2311.12887, which applied a 2016 framework due to Ostrev for constructing error bounds beyond CHSH and XOR games, in addition to the existence of well-posed semidefinite programs for determining primal feasible solutions, along with quantum-classical duality gaps, it continues to remain of interest to further develop the construction of error bounds, and related objects, to game-theoretic settings with several participants. In such settings, one encounters a rich information theoretic landscape, not only from the fact that there exists a significantly larger combinatorial space of possible strategies for each player, but also several opportunities for pronounced quantum advantage. We conclude this effort by describing other variants of other possible strategies, as proposed sources for quantum advantage, in $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, compiled $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and strong parallel repetition variants of $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ games.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality, consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.</description>
