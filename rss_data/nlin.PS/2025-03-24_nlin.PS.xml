      <title>Multi-phase autoresonant excitations in the Korteweg-de-Vries system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoresonant (continuously phase-locked) two-phase waves of the Korteweg-de-Vries equation are excited and controlled using a two-component, small amplitude, chirped frequency driving. These solutions are analyzed in the weakly nonlinear regime. The theory is based on Whitham's averaged variational principle. The problem is reduced to a fully separated two degrees of freedom dynamical problem. This separation allows for simple derivation of the autoresonant thresholds on the driving wave amplitudes. We also excite more complex 4-phase autoresonant waves. The inverse scattering analysis of this case indicates again the separation of all four degrees of freedom in the associated weakly nonlinear dynamical problem.</description>

      <title>From Disorder to Design: Entropy-Driven Self-Organization in an Agent Based Swarming Model and Pattern Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter seeks to illuminate the profound connection between complexity, self-organization, emergent behaviour, pattern formation, and entropy concepts that are foundational to understanding our universe. By examining these ideas through the lenses of physics, information theory, and nonlinear dynamics, we uncover a fascinating narrative. Starting with a random cluster of particles possessing distinct internal properties, we activate their interactions and observe the emergence of intricate patterns over time. This journey reveals a transition from unlikely to more probable states. At extreme parameter values, the system showcases stunning patterns and turbulent motions remarkable emergent behaviour propelled by entropy and the dynamic exchange of mutual information. Engaging with probability theory helps us to unveil this intricate connectivity, demonstrating not only its significance but also its potential to reshape our understanding of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Unilateral vibration transmission in mechanical systems with bilinear coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unilateral transmission refers to the scenario in which the waves transmitted through a system remain in pure tension or pure compression. This transmission phenomenon may occur in systems that exhibit different effective elasticity in compression and tension; i.e. bilinear elasticity. We present a computational investigation of unilateral transmission in the steady-state response of harmonically driven mechanical systems with bilinear coupling. Starting with two bilinearly coupled oscillators, we find that breaking the mirror symmetry of the system, in either elastic or inertial properties, facilitates unilateral transmission by allowing it to occur near a primary resonance. This asymmetry also enables nonreciprocal transmission to occur. We then investigate the nonreciprocal dynamics of the system, including linear stability analysis, with a focus on unilateral transmission. We also extend our discussion to a bilinear periodic structure, for which we investigate the influence of the number of units and energy dissipation on unilateral transmission. We report on the existence of stable nonreciprocal unilateral transmission near primary and internal resonances of the system, as well as other nonreciprocal features such as period-doubled and quasiperiodic response characteristics.</description>
