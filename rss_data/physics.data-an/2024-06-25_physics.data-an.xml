      <title>Optical and X-ray Photo-emission Spectroscopies of Core/Shell Colloidal CdSe/CdS Quantum Dots: Modeling and Experimental Determination of Band Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical properties of multilayer semi-conductor nano-emitters are crucially dependent on the relative energy levelsof their different components. For core/shell quantum dots, the relative energy difference between conduction bandedge of core and shell materials induces, depending on its value, either a confinement of the electron within the coreor a delocalization of its wave function within the whole quantum dot. This results in drastic consequences on theenergy and the oscillator strength of the fundamental transition. Surprisingly, the literature currently lacks a definitivevalue for the energy difference between CdSe and CdS conduction band edges as most of the experimental studiesprovide values corresponding to specific geometries of quantum dots. Here, we develop a full theoretical modelexpressing energy levels considering core/shell interface pressure, ligands and enabling the accurate prediction ofthe bandgap value with the nanocrystal size. It allows to reliably determine the energy difference between theconduction band edge of CdSe and CdS materials, known as the conduction band offset, in such a way that this valuecan later be used to model quantum dots of any geometry. This value is determined using our model and two differentexperimental methods: optical spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission (XPS) experiments.</description>

      <title>Moment-based parameter inference with error guarantees for stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of models of biochemical kinetics from single-cell data remains challenging because of the uncertainty arising from the intractability of the likelihood function of stochastic reaction networks. Such uncertainty falls beyond current error quantification measures, which focus on the effects of finite sample size and identifiability but lack theoretical guarantees when likelihood approximations are needed. Here, we propose an inference method for stochastic reaction networks with nonlinear and rational propensities at steady state that provides bounds on the parameters via convex optimisation over sets constrained by moment equations and moment matrices. Our approach takes observations from the stochastic reaction network and forms moment intervals, which are then used to constrain parameters through convex sets. The bounds on the parameters contain the true parameters under the condition that the moment intervals contain the true stationary moments, thus providing uncertainty quantification and error guarantees. Our approach does not need to predict moments and distributions for given parameters (i.e., it avoids solving or simulating the forward problem), and hence circumvents intractable likelihood computations or computationally expensive simulations. We demonstrate its use for uncertainty quantification, data integration and prediction of latent species statistics through synthetic data from common nonlinear biochemical models including the Schl\"ogl model, the toggle switch and post-transcriptional regulation.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal statistical features of velocity responses to traffic congestions in a local motorway network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The causal connection between congestions and velocity changes at different locations induces various statistical features, which we identify and measure in detail. We carry out an empirical analysis of large-scale traffic data on a local motorway network around the Breitscheid intersection in the North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We put forward a response function which measures the velocity change at a certain location versus time conditioned on a congestion at another location. We use a novel definition of the corresponding congestion indicator to ensure causality. We find that the response of velocities to the congestion exhibits phase changes in time. A negative response at smaller time lags transforms into positive one at larger time lags, implying a certain traffic mechanism. The response decays as a power law with the distance. We also identify a scaling property leading to a collapse of the response functions on one curve.</description>

      <title>Framework for Multi-messenger Inference from Neutron Stars: Combining Nuclear Theory Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an efficient parameterization of the pure neutron-matter equation of state (EoS) that incorporates the uncertainties from both chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) and phenomenological potential calculations. This parameterization yields a family of EoSs including and extending the forms based purely on these two calculations. In combination with an agnostic inner core EoS, this parameterization is used in a Bayesian inference pipeline to obtain constraints on the e os parameters using multi-messenger observations of neutron stars. We specifically considered observations of the massive pulsar J0740+6620, the binary neutron star coalescence GW170817, and the NICER pulsar J0030+0451. Constraints on neutron star mass-radius relations are obtained and compared. The Bayes factors for the different EoS models are also computed. While current constraints do not reveal any significant preference among these models, the framework developed here may enable future observations with more sensitive detectors to discriminate them.</description>

      <title>Local primordial non-Gaussianity from the large-scale clustering of photometric DESI luminous red galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use angular clustering of luminous red galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys to constrain the local primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $\fnl$. Our sample comprises over 12 million targets, covering 14,000 square degrees of the sky, with redshifts in the range $0.2&lt; z &lt; 1.35$. We identify Galactic extinction, survey depth, and astronomical seeing as the primary sources of systematic error, and employ linear regression and artificial neural networks to alleviate non-cosmological excess clustering on large scales. Our methods are tested against simulations with and without $\fnl$ and systematics, showing superior performance of the neural network treatment. The neural network with a set of nine imaging property maps passes our systematic null test criteria, and is chosen as the fiducial treatment. Assuming the universality relation, we find $\fnl = 34^{+24(+50)}_{-44(-73)}$ at 68\%(95\%) confidence. We apply a series of robustness tests (e.g., cuts on imaging, declination, or scales used) that show consistency in the obtained constraints. We study how the regression method biases the measured angular power-spectrum and degrades the $\fnl$ constraining power. The use of the nine maps more than doubles the uncertainty compared to using only the three primary maps in the regression. Our results thus motivate the development of more efficient methods that avoid over-correction, protect large-scale clustering information, and preserve constraining power. Additionally, our results encourage further studies of $\fnl$ with DESI spectroscopic samples, where the inclusion of 3D clustering modes should help separate imaging systematics and lessen the degradation in the $\fnl$ uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Estimation of waveform deformation with the matched filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many particle physics experiments the data processing is based on the analysis of the digitized waveforms provided by the detector. While the waveform amplitude is usually correlated to the event energy, the shape may carry useful information for event discrimination. Thanks to the high signal to noise ratio they provide, matched filters are often applied. Their original design is however intended for the estimation of the waveform amplitude only.
  In this work we introduce an analytical extension of the original matched filter for the estimation of a possible shape deformation with respect to a reference template. The new filter is validated on simulations and, with respect to shape parameters calculated on unfiltered waveforms or derived from the original matched filter, it improves the discrimination capability by at least a factor 2 both at low and high signal to noise ratios, making it applicable to the data of several experiments.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Structural Morphology Imaged by Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy is a powerful technique for spatially resolving nanoscale structural morphologies by diffraction contrast. One of the critical challenges in experimental nanodiffraction data analysis is posed by the convergence angle of nanoscale focusing optics which creates simultaneous dependency of the far-field scattering data on three independent components of the local strain tensor - corresponding to dilation and two potential rigid body rotations of the unit cell. All three components are in principle resolvable through a spatially mapped sample tilt series however traditional data analysis is computationally expensive and prone to artifacts. In this study, we implement NanobeamNN, a convolutional neural network specifically tailored to the analysis of scanning probe X-ray microscopy data. NanobeamNN learns lattice strain and rotation angles from simulated diffraction of a focused X-ray nanobeam by an epitaxial thin film and can directly make reasonable predictions on experimental data without the need for additional fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this approach represents a significant advancement in computational speed over conventional methods, as well as a potential improvement in accuracy over the current standard.</description>
