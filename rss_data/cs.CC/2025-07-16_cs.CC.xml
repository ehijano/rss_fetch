      <title>Eigenvalue Bounds for Symmetric Markov Chains on Multislices With Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walks on ``balanced multislices'' of any ``grid'' that respects the ``symmetries'' of the grid, and show that a broad class of such walks are good spectral expanders. (A grid is a set of points of the form $\mathcal{S}^n$ for finite $\mathcal{S}$, and a balanced multi-slice is the subset that contains an equal number of coordinates taking every value in $\mathcal{S}$. A walk respects symmetries if the probability of going from $u = (u_1,\ldots,u_n)$ to $v = (v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ is invariant under simultaneous permutations of the coordinates of $u$ and $v$.) Our main theorem shows that, under some technical conditions, every such walk where a single step leads to an almost $\mathcal{O}(1)$-wise independent distribution on the next state, conditioned on the previous state, satisfies a non-trivially small singular value bound.
  We give two applications of our theorem to error-correcting codes: (1) We give an analog of the Ore-DeMillo-Lipton-Schwartz-Zippel lemma for polynomials, and junta-sums, over balanced multislices. (2) We also give a local list-correction algorithm for $d$-junta-sums mapping an arbitrary grid $\mathcal{S}^n$ to an Abelian group, correcting from a near-optimal $(\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|^{d}} - \varepsilon)$ fraction of errors for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where a $d$-junta-sum is a sum of (arbitrarily many) $d$-juntas (and a $d$-junta is a function that depends on only $d$ of the $n$ variables).
  Our proofs are obtained by exploring the representation theory of the symmetric group and merging it with some careful spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Equality is Far Weaker than Constant-Cost Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit an $n$-bit communication problem with a constant-cost randomized protocol but which requires $n^{\Omega(1)}$ deterministic (or even non-deterministic) queries to an Equality oracle. Therefore, even constant-cost randomized protocols cannot be efficiently "derandomized" using Equality oracles. This improves on several recent results and answers a question from the survey of Hatami and Hatami (SIGACT News 2024). It also gives a significantly simpler and quantitatively superior proof of the main result of Fang, G\"o\"os, Harms, and Hatami ( STOC 2025), that constant-cost communication does not reduce to the $k$-Hamming Distance hierarchy.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Skolem Problem at Low Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) $\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ over the integers has a zero term, that is, whether there exists $n$ such that $u_n = 0$. Decidability of the problem is open in general, with the most notable positive result being a decision procedure for LRS of order at most 4.
  In this paper we consider a bounded version of the Skolem Problem, in which the input consists of an LRS $\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ and a bound $N \in \mathbb N$ (with all integers written in binary), and the task is to determine whether there exists $n\in\{0,\ldots,N\}$ such that $u_n=0$. We give a randomised algorithm for this problem that, for all $d\in \mathbb N$, runs in polynomial time on the class of LRS of order at most $d$. As a corollary we show that the (unrestricted) Skolem Problem for LRS of order at most 4 lies in $\mathsf{coRP}$, improving the best previous upper bound of $\mathsf{NP}^{\mathsf{RP}}$.
  The running time of our algorithm is exponential in the order of the LRS -- a dependence that appears necessary in view of the $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness of the Bounded Skolem Problem. However, even for LRS of a fixed order, the problem involves detecting zeros within an exponentially large range. For this, our algorithm relies on results from $p$-adic analysis to isolate polynomially many candidate zeros and then test in randomised polynomial time whether each candidate is an actual zero by reduction to arithmetic-circuit identity testing.</description>

      <title>A Fast Coloring Oracle for Average Case Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraph $2$-colorability is one of the classical NP-hard problems. Person and Schacht [SODA'09] designed a deterministic algorithm whose expected running time is polynomial over a uniformly chosen $2$-colorable $3$-uniform hypergraph. Lee, Molla, and Nagle recently extended this to $k$-uniform hypergraphs for all $k\geq 3$. Both papers relied heavily on the regularity lemma, hence their analysis was involved and their running time hid tower-type constants.
  Our first result in this paper is a new simple and elementary deterministic $2$-coloring algorithm that reproves the theorems of Person-Schacht and Lee-Molla-Nagle while avoiding the use of the regularity lemma. We also show how to turn our new algorithm into a randomized one with average expected running time of only $O(n)$.
  Our second and main result gives what we consider to be the ultimate evidence of just how easy it is to find a $2$-coloring of an average $2$-colorable hypergraph. We define a coloring oracle to be an algorithm which, given vertex $v$, assigns color red/blue to $v$ while inspecting as few edges as possible, so that the answers to any sequence of queries to the oracle are consistent with a single legal $2$-coloring of the input. Surprisingly, we show that there is a coloring oracle that, on average, can answer every vertex query in time $O(1)$.</description>

      <title>FPT Parameterisations of Fractional and Generalised Hypertree Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fixed-parameter tractable (fpt) algorithms for precisely determining several central hypergraph decomposition parameters, including generalized hypertree width, fractional hypertree width, and adaptive width. Despite the recognized importance of these measures in complexity theory, databases, and constraint satisfaction, no exact fpt algorithms for any of them had previously been known. Our results are obtained for hypergraph classes of bounded rank and bounded degree.
  Our approach extends a recent algorithm for treewidth (Boja\'ncyk &amp; Pilipczuk, LMCS 2022) utilizing monadic second-order (MSO) transductions. Leveraging this framework, we overcome the significant technical hurdles presented by hypergraphs, whose structural decompositions are technically much more intricate than their graph counterparts.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Optimal Correlated Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major open question in algorithmic game theory is whether normal-form correlated equilibria (NFCE) can be computed efficiently in succinct games such as extensive-form games [DFF+25,6PR24,FP23,HvS08,VSF08,PR08]. Motivated by this question, we study the associated Threshold problem: deciding whether there exists a correlated equilibrium whose value exceeds a given threshold. We prove that this problem is PSPACE-hard for NFCE in multiplayer extensive-form games with perfect recall, even for fixed thresholds. To contextualize this result, we also establish the complexity of the Threshold problem for Nash equilibria in this setting, showing it is ER-complete. These results uncover a surprising complexity reversal: while optimal correlated equilibria are computationally simpler than optimal Nash in normal-form games, the opposite holds in extensive-form games, where computing optimal correlated equilibria is provably harder. Building on this line of inquiry, we also address a related question by [VSF08], who introduced the notions of extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) and agent-form correlated equilibrium (AFCE). They asked how difficult the Threshold problem is for AFCE; we answer this question by proving that it is NP-hard, even in two-player games without chance nodes. Complementing our hardness results, we establish tight complexity classifications for the Threshold problem across several correlated equilibrium concepts - including EFCE, AFCE, normal-form coarse, extensive-form coarse, and agent-form coarse correlated equilibria. For each of these solution concepts in multiplayer stochastic extensive-form games with perfect recall, we prove NP-completeness by providing matching NP upper bounds to the previously known hardness results. Together, our results provide the most complete landscape to date for the complexity of optimal equilibrium computation in extensive-form games.</description>

      <title>The Randomized Query Complexity of Finding a Tarski Fixed Point on the Boolean Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Knaster-Tarski theorem, also known as Tarski's theorem, guarantees that every monotone function defined on a complete lattice has a fixed point. We analyze the query complexity of finding such a fixed point on the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$ under the $\leq$ relation. Specifically, there is an unknown monotone function $f: \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k \to \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k$ and an algorithm must query a vertex $v$ to learn $f(v)$.
  A key special case of interest is the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^k$, which is isomorphic to the power set lattice--the original setting of the Knaster-Tarski theorem. We prove a lower bound that characterizes the randomized and deterministic query complexity of the Tarski search problem on the Boolean hypercube as $\Theta(k)$. More generally, we give a randomized lower bound of $\Omega\left( k + \frac{k \log{n}}{\log{k}} \right)$ for the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$, which is asymptotically optimal in high dimensions when $k$ is large relative to $n$.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Tractable Marginalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Marginalization -- summing a function over all assignments to a subset of its inputs -- is a fundamental computational problem with applications from probabilistic inference to formal verification. Despite its computational hardness in general, there exist many classes of functions (e.g., probabilistic models) for which marginalization remains tractable, and they can be commonly expressed by polynomial size arithmetic circuits computing multilinear polynomials. This raises the question, can all functions with polynomial time marginalization algorithms be succinctly expressed by such circuits? We give a negative answer, exhibiting simple functions with tractable marginalization yet no efficient representation by known models, assuming $\textsf{FP}\neq\#\textsf{P}$ (an assumption implied by $\textsf{P} \neq \textsf{NP}$). To this end, we identify a hierarchy of complexity classes corresponding to stronger forms of marginalization, all of which are efficiently computable on the known circuit models. We conclude with a completeness result, showing that whenever there is an efficient real RAM performing virtual evidence marginalization for a function, then there are small circuits for that function's multilinear representation.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>QSETH strikes again: finer quantum lower bounds for lattice problem, strong simulation, hitting set problem, and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While seemingly undesirable, it is not a surprising fact that there are certain problems for which quantum computers offer no computational advantage over their respective classical counterparts. Moreover, there are problems for which there is no `useful' computational advantage possible with the current quantum hardware. This situation however can be beneficial if we don't want quantum computers to solve certain problems fast - say problems relevant to post-quantum cryptography. In such a situation, we would like to have evidence that it is difficult to solve those problems on quantum computers; but what is their exact complexity?
  To do so one has to prove lower bounds, but proving unconditional time lower bounds has never been easy. As a result, resorting to conditional lower bounds has been quite popular in the classical community and is gaining momentum in the quantum community. In this paper, by the use of the QSETH framework [Buhrman-Patro-Speelman 2021], we are able to understand the quantum complexity of a few natural variants of CNFSAT, such as parity-CNFSAT or counting-CNFSAT, and also are able to comment on the non-trivial complexity of approximate-#CNFSAT; both of these have interesting implications about the complexity of (variations of) lattice problems, strong simulation and hitting set problem, and more.
  In the process, we explore the QSETH framework in greater detail than was (required and) discussed in the original paper, thus also serving as a useful guide on how to effectively use the QSETH framework.</description>
