      <title>Listing spanning trees of outerplanar graphs by pivot exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the spanning trees of any outerplanar triangulation $G$ can be listed so that any two consecutive spanning trees differ in an exchange of two edges that share an end vertex. For outerplanar graphs $G$ with faces of arbitrary lengths (not necessarily 3) we establish a similar result, with the condition that the two exchanged edges share an end vertex or lie on a common face. These listings of spanning trees are obtained from a simple greedy algorithm that can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ per generated spanning tree, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$. Furthermore, the listings correspond to Hamilton paths on the 0/1-polytope that is obtained as the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of all spanning trees of $G$.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic monotiles: from geometry to groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, two striking, nearly simultaneous, mathematical discoveries have excited their respective communities, one by Greenfeld and Tao, the other (the Hat tile) by Smith, Myers, Kaplan and Goodman-Strauss, which can both be summed up as the following: there exists a single tile that tiles, but not periodically (sometimes dubbed the einstein problem). The two settings and the tools are quite different (as emphasized by their almost disjoint bibliographies): one in euclidean geometry, the other in group theory. Both are highly nontrivial: in the first case, one allows complex shapes; in the second one, also the space to tile may be complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose here a framework that embeds both of these problems. We illustrate our setting by transforming the Hat tile into a new aperiodic group monotile, and we describe its symmetries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>On 1-Planar Graphs with Bounded Cop-Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a type of pursuit-evasion game played on a graph where a set of cops try to capture a single robber. The cops first choose their initial vertex positions, and later the robber chooses a vertex. The cops and robbers make their moves in alternate turns: in the cops' turn, every cop can either choose to move to an adjacent vertex or stay on the same vertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. If the cops can capture the robber in a finite number of rounds, the cops win, otherwise the robber wins. The cop-number of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to catch a robber in the graph. It has long been known that graphs embedded on surfaces (such as planar graphs and toroidal graphs) have a small cop-number. Recently, Durocher et al. [Graph Drawing, 2023] investigated the problem of cop-number for the class of $1$-planar graphs, which are graphs that can be embedded in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once. They showed that unlike planar graphs which require just three cops, 1-planar graphs have an unbounded cop-number. On the positive side, they showed that maximal 1-planar graphs require only three cops by crucially using the fact that the endpoints of every crossing in an embedded maximal 1-planar graph induce a $K_4$. In this paper, we show that the cop-number remains bounded even under the relaxed condition that the endpoints induce at least three edges. More precisely, let an $\times$-crossing of an embedded 1-planar graph be a crossing whose endpoints induce a matching; i.e., there is no edge connecting the endpoints apart from the crossing edges themselves. We show that any 1-planar graph that can be embedded without $\times$-crossings has cop-number at most 21. Moreover, any 1-planar graph that can be embedded with at most $\gamma$ $\times$-crossings has cop-number at most $\gamma + 21$.</description>

      <title>Two hardness results for the maximum 2-edge-colorable subgraph problem in bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the maximum $k$-edge-colorable subgraph problem. In this problem we are given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the goal to take $k$ matchings of $G$ such that their union contains maximum number of edges. This problem is NP-hard in cubic graphs, and polynomial time solvable in bipartite graphs as we observe in our paper. We present two NP-hardness results for two versions of this problem where we have weights on edges or color constraints on vertices. In fact, we show that these versions are NP-hard already in bipartite graphs of maximum degree three. In order to achieve these results, we establish a connection between our problems and the problem of construction of special maximum matchings considered in the Master thesis of the author and defended back in 2003.</description>

      <title>Renaming in distributed certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local certification is the area of distributed network computing asking the following question: How to certify to the nodes of a network that a global property holds, if they are limited to a local verification? In this area, it is often essential to have identifiers, that is, unique integers assigned to the nodes. In this short paper, we show how to reduce the range of the identifiers, in three different settings. More precisely, we show how to rename identifiers in the classical local certification setting, when we can (resp. cannot) choose the new identifiers, and we show how a global certificate can help to encode very compactly a new identifier assignment that is not injective in general, but still useful. We conclude with a number of applications of these three results.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of $m$-ary functions and low degree partitions of Hamming graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of complexity measures of Boolean functions led Nisan and Szegedy to state the sensitivity conjecture in 1994, claiming a polynomial relation between degree and sensitivity. This problem remained unsolved until 2019, when Huang proved the conjecture via an equivalent graph theoretical reformulation due to Gotsman and Linial.
  We study $m$-ary functions, i.e., functions $f: T^n \rightarrow T$ where $T\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is a finite alphabet of cardinality $|T| = m $ and extend the notions of degree $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ and sensitivity $s(f)$ to $m$-ary functions and show $s(f)\in O(\mathrm{deg}(f)^2)$. This generalizes results of Nisan and Szegedy. Conversely, we introduce the $m$-ary sensitivity conjecture, claiming a polynomial upper bound for $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ in terms of $s(f)$. Analogously to results of Gotsman and Linial, we provide a formulation of the conjecture in terms of imbalanced partitions of Hamming graphs into low degree subgraphs. Combining this with ideas of Chung, F\"uredi, Graham and Seymour, we show that for any prime $p$ the bound in the $p$-ary sensitivity conjecture has to be at least quadratic: there exist $p$-ary functions $f$ of arbitrarily large degree and $\mathrm{deg}(f)\in \Omega(s(f)^2)$.</description>

      <title>Extending Stable and Popular Matching Algorithms from Bipartite to Arbitrary Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stable and popular matching problems in arbitrary graphs, which are referred to as stable roommates instances. We extend the 3/2-approximation algorithm for the maximum size weakly stable matching problem to the roommates case, which solves a more than 20 year old open question of Irving and Manlove about the approximability of maximum size weakly stable matchings in roommates instances with ties [Irving and Manlove 2002] and has nice applications for the problem of matching residents to hospitals in the presence of couples. We also extend the algorithm that finds a maximum size popular matching in bipartite graphs in the case of strict preferences and the algorithm to find a popular matching among maximum weight matchings. While previous attempts to extend the idea of promoting the agents or duplicating the edges from bipartite instances to arbitrary ones failed, these results show that with the help of a simple observation, we can indeed bridge the gap and extend these algorithms</description>

      <title>On the tractability and approximability of non-submodular cardinality-based $s$-$t$ cut problems in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A minimum $s$-$t$ cut in a hypergraph is a bipartition of vertices that separates two nodes $s$ and $t$ while minimizing a hypergraph cut function. The cardinality-based hypergraph cut function assigns a cut penalty to each hyperedge based on the number of nodes in the hyperedge that are on each side of the split. Previous work has shown that when hyperedge cut penalties are submodular, this problem can be reduced to a graph $s$-$t$ cut problem and hence solved in polynomial time. NP-hardness results are also known for a certain class of non-submodular penalties, though the complexity remained open in many parameter regimes. In this paper we highlight and leverage a connection to Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems to show that the problem is NP-hard for all non-submodular hyperedge cut penalty, except for one trivial case where a 0-cost solution is always possible. We then turn our attention to approximation strategies and approximation hardness results in the non-submodular case. We design a strategy for projecting non-submodular penalties to the submodular region, which we prove gives the optimal approximation among all such projection strategies. We also show that alternative approaches are unlikely to provide improved guarantees, by showing it is UGC-hard to obtain a better approximation in the simplest setting where all hyperedges have exactly 4 nodes.</description>

      <title>Galled Perfect Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting horizontal gene transfers often requires comparative sequence data, but recent work has shown that character-based approaches could also be useful for this task. Notably, perfect transfer networks (PTN) explain the character diversity of a set of taxa for traits that are gained once, rarely lost, but that can be transferred laterally. Characterizing the structure of such characters is an important step towards understanding more complex characters. Although efficient algorithms can infer such networks from character data, they can sometimes predict overly complicated transfer histories. With the goal of recovering the simplest possible scenarios in this model, we introduce galled perfect transfer networks, which are PTNs that are galled trees. Such networks are useful for characters that are incompatible in terms of tree-like evolution, but that do fit in an almost-tree scenario. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for two problems: deciding whether one can add transfer edges to a tree to transform it into a galled PTN, and deciding whether a set of characters are galled-compatible, that is, they can be explained by some galled PTN. We also analyze a real dataset comprising of a bacterial species trees and KEGG functions as characters, and derive several conclusions on the difficulty of explaining characters in a galled tree, which provide several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Conflict-free chromatic index of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is conflict-free $k$-edge-colorable if there exists an assignment of $k$ colors to $E(G)$ such that for every edge $e\in E(G)$, there is a color that is assigned to exactly one edge among the closed neighborhood of $e$. The smallest $k$ such that $G$ is conflict-free $k$-edge-colorable is called the conflict-free chromatic index of $G$, denoted $\chi'_{CF}(G)$. D\c{e}bski and Przyby\a{l}o showed that $2\le\chi'_{CF}(T)\le 3$ for every tree $T$ of size at least two. In this paper, we present an algorithm to determine the conflict-free chromatic index of a tree without 2-degree vertices, in time $O(|V(T)|)$. This partially answer a question raised by Kamyczura, Meszka and Przyby\a{l}o.</description>

Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a coloring of its edges, a subgraph of $G$ is called rainbow if its edges have distinct colors. The rainbow girth of an edge coloring of G is the minimum length of a rainbow cycle in G. A generalization of the famous Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture, proposed by the first author, is that if in an coloring of the edge set of an $n$-vertex graph by $n$ colors, in which each color class is of size $k$, the rainbow girth is at most $\lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil$. In the known examples for sharpness of this conjecture the color classes are stars, suggesting that when the color classes are matchings, the result may be improved. We show that the rainbow girth of $n$ matchings of size at least 2 is $O(\log n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the famous Caccetta--H\"aggkvist conjecture, suggested by Aharoni [Rainbow triangles and the Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture, J. Graph Theory (2019)], is that any family $\mathcal{F}=(F_1, \ldots,F_n)$ of sets of edges in $K_n$, each of size $k$, has a rainbow cycle of length at most $\lceil \frac{n}{k}\rceil$. In [Rainbow cycles for families of matchings, Israel J. Math. (2023)] and [Non-uniform degrees and rainbow versions of the Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture, SIAM J. Discrete Math. (2023)] it was shown that asymptotically this can be improved to $O(\log n)$ if all sets are matchings of size 2, or all are triangles. We show that the same is true in the mixed case, i.e., if each $F_i$ is either a matching of size 2 or a triangle. We also study the case that each $F_i$ is a matching of size 2 or a single edge, or each $F_i$ is a triangle or a single edge, and in each of these cases we determine the threshold proportion between the types, beyond which the rainbow girth goes from linear to logarithmic.</description>

      <title>A Dichotomy Theorem for Linear Time Homomorphism Orbit Counting in Bounded Degeneracy Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counting the number of homomorphisms of a pattern graph H in a large input graph G is a fundamental problem in computer science. There are myriad applications of this problem in databases, graph algorithms, and network science. Often, we need more than just the total count. Especially in large network analysis, we wish to compute, for each vertex v of G, the number of H-homomorphisms that v participates in. This problem is referred to as homomorphism orbit counting, as it relates to the orbits of vertices of H under its automorphisms.
  Given the need for fast algorithms for this problem, we study when near-linear time algorithms are possible. A natural restriction is to assume that the input graph G has bounded degeneracy, a commonly observed property in modern massive networks. Can we characterize the patterns H for which homomorphism orbit counting can be done in near-linear time?
  We discover a dichotomy theorem that resolves this problem. For pattern H, let l be the length of the longest induced path between any two vertices of the same orbit (under the automorphisms of H). If l =&lt; 5, then H-homomorphism orbit counting can be done in near-linear time for bounded degeneracy graphs. If l &gt; 5, then (assuming fine-grained complexity conjectures) there is no near-linear time algorithm for this problem. We build on existing work on dichotomy theorems for counting the total H-homomorphism count. Somewhat surprisingly, there exist (and we characterize) patterns H for which the total homomorphism count can be computed in near-linear time, but the corresponding orbit counting problem cannot be done in near-linear time.</description>

      <title>Posets are easily testable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alon and Shapira proved that every monotone class (closed under taking subgraphs) of undirected graphs is strongly testable, that is, under the promise that a given graph is either in the class or $\varepsilon$-far from it, there is a test using a constant number of samples (depending on $\varepsilon$ only) that rejects every graph not in the class with probability at least one half, and always accepts a graph in the class. However, their bound on the number of samples is quite large since they heavily rely on Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma. We study the case of posets and show that every monotone class of posets is easily testable, that is, a polynomial (of $\varepsilon^{-1}$) number of samples is sufficient. We achieve this via proving a polynomial removal lemma for posets.
  We give a simple classification: for every monotone class of posets, there is an $h$ such that the class is indistinguishable (every large enough poset in one class is $\varepsilon$-close to a poset in the other class) from the class of $C_h$-free posets, where $C_h$ denotes the chain with $h$ elements. This allows us to test every monotone class of posets using $O(\varepsilon^{-1})$ samples. The test has a two-sided error, but it is almost complete: the probability of refuting a poset in the class is polynomially small in the size of the poset.
  The analogous results hold for comparability graphs, too.</description>

      <title>Derandomized Non-Abelian Homomorphism Testing in Low Soundness Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a randomness-efficient homomorphism test in the low soundness regime for functions, $f: G\to \mathbb{U}_t$, from an arbitrary finite group $G$ to $t\times t$ unitary matrices. We show that if such a function passes a derandomized Blum--Luby--Rubinfeld (BLR) test (using small-bias sets), then (i) it correlates with a function arising from a genuine homomorphism, and (ii) it has a non-trivial Fourier mass on a low-dimensional irreducible representation.
  In the full randomness regime, such a test for matrix-valued functions on finite groups implicitly appears in the works of Gowers and Hatami [Sbornik: Mathematics '17], and Moore and Russell [SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics '15]. Thus, our work can be seen as a near-optimal derandomization of their results. Our key technical contribution is a "degree-2 expander mixing lemma'' that shows that Gowers' $\mathrm{U}^2$ norm can be efficiently estimated by restricting it to a small-bias subset. Another corollary is a "derandomized'' version of a useful lemma due to Babai, Nikolov, and Pyber [SODA'08] and Gowers [Comb. Probab. Comput.'08].</description>
