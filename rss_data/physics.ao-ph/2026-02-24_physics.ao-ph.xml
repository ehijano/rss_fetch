      <title>AI-based Regional Emulation for Kilometer-Scale Dynamical Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An AI-based Limited-Area Model (LAM) is developed for dynamical downscaling over the Southern Great Plains and the southeastern United States, with strong generalization abilities under diverse boundary conditions. The model is trained using 0.25-degree, 3-hourly ERA5 as forcings and CONUS404 as targets in 1980--2019, producing 4-km, hourly dynamical downscaling outputs; it is also connected to a post-processing model to derive additional diagnostic variables. The model is evaluated across multiple forcing datasets, time periods, and climate regimes. For present-day downscaling in the 2021--2024 water years, the model produces stable multi-year simulations with no unrealistic drift; its deterministic verification scores are comparable to other weather-forecasting-oriented AI models. The model also generalizes robustly to a 1.0-degree, 6-hourly non-ERA5 forcing dataset, yielding only minor performance changes. Frontal cyclone and hurricane case studies further demonstrate that the model reconstructs realistic, interpretable weather-scale dynamical and thermodynamic structure from coarse boundary information. The AI-based LAM is further tested by downscaling 30-year global climate model runs in 1980--2010 and 2070--2100, and climate model ensembles in 2025-2027. In this application, the model remains stable at hourly downscaling frequencies for all 30 years and effectively captures future climate-change signals, indicating meaningful generalization across different climate regimes. When downscaling ensembles, the model produces well-posed ensemble distributions without collapsing the ensemble spread. Overall, the AI-based LAM of this study offers good downscaling performance and generalization abilities. It provides a practical and transferable example of adapting AI weather prediction models for regional climate applications.</description>

      <title>On Using Medium-Range Ensemble Forecasts for Storm Transposition of Synoptic-Scale Systems in Probable Maximum Precipitation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most methods for estimating probable maximum precipitation (PMP) -- the greatest depth of precipitation that is physically possible over a given area and duration -- rely on storm transposition (ST), the process of transporting a storm, either historically observed or simulated, from its original location to a target basin. Existing ST approaches, whether classical or physically based, involve assumptions and manipulations that can introduce inconsistencies, leaving the physical validity of the transposed storm uncertain. In this study, the internal variability leveraging (IVL) approach is used to transpose an atmospheric river cluster that affected the U.S. West Coast during 20-29 October 2021. Steering the storm toward the target basin and determining its transposition region are achieved by considering an ensemble of plausible storm evolutions and trajectories obtained from archived ECMWF medium-range forecasts. The Willamette River and Nass River watersheds, located approximately 6 deg N, 2 deg W and 16 deg N, 8 deg W, respectively, from the area most affected by the observed precipitation, were selected as target basins. For each basin, the IVL realization yielding the largest 24-h basin-average precipitation depth was identified, and the initial and boundary condition shifting method was subsequently applied to further enhance its impact, producing 24-h precipitation depths of 119 mm for the Willamette and 98 mm for the Nass.</description>

      <title>Koopman Analysis of Sea Surface Temperature with a Signature Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a trajectory-based Koopman method for sea surface temperature (SST) that lifts annual SST segments using a signature kernel -- a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) kernel that compares paths via iterated-integral features -- and learns the one-year shift operator. By operating on annual trajectory segments rather than instantaneous fields, the method encodes finite-time history, which helps capture memory effects in SST-only evolution. The resulting operator improves out-of-sample multi-year forecast skill relative to a climatology baseline and reveals coherent spectral modes. We implement the approach via kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) on signature-kernel Gram matrices, yielding a single pipeline for forecasting and spectral diagnostics of high-dimensional SST dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Monthly Temperature Prediction for Jilin Province: A Multi Model Comparative Study 2000 2026</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jilin Province, a core commercial grain production base in China with a mid-temperate continental monsoon climate and significant temperature fluctuations, relies heavily on temperature for agricultural production and ecological security. Existing temperature prediction studies focus mostly on national/southeastern coastal regions, with few targeting Jilin's specific climatic characteristics, and most models fail to integrate local temperature's spatiotemporal differentiation and seasonal periodicity, limiting prediction accuracy.
  Using 1 km $\times$ 1 km monthly mean temperature raster data (2000--2024) of Jilin Province, we analyzed regional temperature's spatiotemporal variation and constructed a multi-model comparison system including four deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, Transformer) and five traditional machine learning models (Ridge/Lasso Regression, SVR, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting). Model performance was evaluated via RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$.
  Results show Jilin's temperature has obvious latitudinal zonal distribution, significant warming trend, strong seasonal periodicity, and high temporal autocorrelation. The LSTM model achieved optimal performance (test set RMSE=2.26 $^\circ$C, MAE=1.83 $^\circ$C, $R^2$=0.9655), outperforming traditional models and Transformer. Predictions for 2025--2026 indicate stable seasonal temperature fluctuations with an annual mean of ~4.9 $^\circ$C.
  This study enriches mid-latitude cold region temperature prediction research, verifies LSTM's applicability for Jilin's monthly temperature prediction, and provides scientific support for agricultural planning, frost disaster warning, and extreme temperature risk prevention.</description>

      <title>The impact of electron precipitation on Earth's thermospheric NO production and the drag of LEO satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response of space weather events on Earth's upper atmosphere over the polar regions by studying their effect on the drag of the CHAMP and GRACE satellites. Increasing solar activity that results in heating and the expansion of the upper atmosphere threatens low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Auroral events are closely related to the stellar energy deposition of solar EUV radiation and precipitating energetic electrons, which influence photochemical processes such as the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the upper atmosphere. To study the production of NO molecules and their influence on the thermospheric structure and satellite drag, we first model Earth's background thermosphere with the 1D upper atmosphere model Kompot by considering the incident X-ray, EUV, and IR radiation during selected space weather events. To investigate the effect of electron precipitation in the production of NO molecules in the polar thermosphere, we apply a Monte Carlo model accounting for the stochastic nature of collisional scattering of auroral electrons in collisions with the surrounding N$_2$-O$_2$ atmosphere, including the production of suprathermal N atoms. The observed effect of the atmospheric drag on CHAMP and GRACE during the two studied events indicates that a sporadic enhancement of NO molecule production in the polar thermosphere and its IR-cooling capability, which counteracts thermospheric expansion and can lead to an ``overcooling'' with decreased density after the space weather event, can have a protective effect on LEO satellites. Their production efficiency, however, is highly dependent on the energy flux of the precipitating electrons. Our results have direct implications for empirical satellite orbit prediction models, as our simulations highlight the need to consider precipitation-induced NO production to improve the predictive power of these models.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of strong solutions to the non-isentropic compressible primitive equations with vertical diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the absence of dynamical equation in the vertical momentum component of the primitive equations (PEs) of atmospheric dynamics, the vertical component of the velocity can be recovered only from the information on the other physical quantities, while utilizing the hydrostatic balance. This causes one spatial derivative loss while leads to a stronger nonlinearity, comparing to the classic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, the mathematical analysis on the compressible primitive equations is mathematically more challenging than that on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem to the non-isentropic compressible primitive equations with only vertical diffusion for the temperature, but without gravity. Local existence and uniqueness as well as the continuous dependence on the initial data of strong solutions are established for any suitably regular initial data. The initial velocity and pressure are assumed here to be of one order derivative higher regularity than that of the initial density.</description>

      <title>A retrospective on the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season was intermittent, with extended quiet periods separated by three clusters of activity. The broad-scale conditions were often unfavourable for cyclogenesis and common drivers of activity such as La Ni\~na were weak, but well above-average sea temperatures still supported intense storms. Activity was limited by periods of strong vertical shear and a disrupted West African Monsoon, including a lull during the climatological peak of activity in August. During September and October, strong seed disturbances underwent cyclogenesis in the tropical Atlantic, coinciding with Kelvin wave activity and favourable MJO conditions.</description>

      <title>STCast: Adaptive Boundary Alignment for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting (STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns. Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.</description>

      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>
