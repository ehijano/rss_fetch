      <title>Starting vortex strength in an impulsively started airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work characterises the starting vortex and unsteady shear layer generated by an impulsively started airfoil at low angles of attack. The net circulation in the field is accurately predicted by Wagner's function. It is observed that the starting vortex detaches from the shear layer whilst the airfoil is surging. Starting vortex circulation at detachment is presented for a range of surge speeds at pre-stall angles of attack for a given surge distance. Kinematic conditions resulting in starting vortex detachment are examined qualitatively through Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents and quantitatively through a non-dimensional parameter proposed by Sattari et al. (2012). Furthermore, the formation of secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz-type vortices in the shear layer is found to depend on the Reynolds number rather than the detachment of the starting vortex.</description>

      <title>Plane-Symmetric Capillary Turbulence: Five-Wave Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of isotropic capillary turbulence was developed in the late 1960s by Zakharov and Filonenko. To date, the analytical solution of the kinetic equation describing the stationary transfer of energy to small scales due to three-wave resonant interactions, called the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum, has been confirmed with high accuracy. However, in the case of strong anisotropy in wave propagation, where all waves are collinear, the situation changes significantly. In such a degenerate geometry, the conditions of resonant interaction cease to be fulfilled not only for three waves, but also for four interacting waves. In this work, we perform fully nonlinear simulations of plane-symmetric capillary turbulence. We demonstrate that the system of interacting waves evolves into a quasi-stationary state with a direct energy cascade, despite the absence of low-order resonances. The calculated spectra of surface elevations are accurately described by analytical estimates derived dimensionally under the assumption of the dominant influence of five-wave resonant interactions. A detailed study of the statistical characteristics of the weakly turbulent state does not reveal the influence of any coherent or strongly nonlinear structures. The performed high-order correlation analysis indicates a variety of non-trivial five-wave resonances. We show that the process of wave decay into two pairs of counter-propagating waves is responsible for the local energy transfer to small scales. Overall, the calculation results are in good agreement with both the weak turbulence theory and recent experiments made by Ricard and Falco</description>

      <title>Relationship between the power spectral density of the Lagrangian velocity and the hierarchy of coherent vortices in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct direct numerical simulations of developed turbulence in a periodic cube to investigate the formation mechanism of the power spectral density of the Lagrangian velocity. We compare the power spectral density of the Lagrangian velocity of turbulent flows with different forcing methods and Reynolds numbers. This systematic comparison demonstrates that universal behavior is observed in a narrow high-frequency regime, whereas non-universality originating from the forcing method broadly appears in a low-frequency regime. To reveal the formation mechanism of the spectra in terms of the hierarchy of coherent structures in turbulence, we propose a scale-decomposition method for the Lagrangian velocity, which enables us to evaluate the contribution of vortices at different scales. This scale-decomposition analysis directly demonstrates that the largest-scale flows driven by the external force can contaminate the Kolmogorov scaling of the Lagrangian velocity spectra formed by small-scale vortices in the inertial range, thus leading to the narrow Lagrangian inertial range. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this remarkable effect by the largest-scale flows is specific to the Lagrange velocity by demonstrating that the power spectral density of the Eulerian velocity is less sensitive to the forcing method.</description>

      <title>coupledMatrixFoam: a foam-extend-based fully-implicit solver for heterogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of multiphase flows in porous media is fundamental to various fields, including oil recovery, CO2 sequestration, hydrogeology, and others. Accurate predictions of fluid behavior in these systems can enhance process efficiency while mitigating environmental and health risks. In this context, numerical simulation serves as a powerful tool for anticipating complex flow phenomena and optimizing engineering strategies. Both commercial simulators and open-source softwares, such as the porousMultiphaseFoam repository based on the OpenFOAM framework, have been developed to model these processes. However, simulating heterogeneous porous media with complex porosity and permeability distributions poses significant numerical challenges. To address these, we introduce coupledMatrixFoam, a new OpenFOAM-based solver designed for enhanced robustness and numerical stability. coupledMatrixFoam integrates the Eulerian multi-fluid formulation for phase fractions with Darcy's law for porous media flow, employing a fully implicit, block-coupled solution for the governing equations. Built on Foam-extend 5.0, it leverages the latest fvBlockMatrix developments to improve computational efficiency. This approach enables a significant increase in time step sizes, particularly in cases involving capillary pressure effects and other complex physical interactions. This work details the development, implementation, and validation of coupledMatrixFoam, including comparisons with porousMultiphaseFoam to assess performance improvements. Additionally, a scalability analysis is conducted, demonstrating the solver's suitability for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, which are essential for large-scale, real-world simulations.</description>

      <title>Disentangling discrete and continuous spectra of tidally forced internal waves in shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of internal waves driven by barotropic tides over seafloor topography is a central issue in developing mixing and wave drag parameterizations. Traditional analytical methods for calculating the energy conversion rate from barotropic tides to internal waves rely on expanding a wave field into discrete eigenmodes. However, this modal expansion becomes inadequate when a sheared background current is present, as singular solutions accompanied by critical levels emerge. To uncover the distinct roles of regular eigenmodes and singular solutions in tidal energy conversion, this study analytically investigates wave generation over a localized bottom obstacle in the presence of shear flow under a basic irrotational condition. Using horizontal Fourier and temporal Laplace transforms, we identify regions in the topographic wave number and forcing frequency space where unbounded energy growth occurs. These regions coincide with the spectrum of an operator governing free wave propagation and comprise the discrete and continuous parts, which correspond to regular eigenmodes and singular solutions, respectively. Asymptotic evaluation of the Fourier integral reveals that the flow field far from the obstacle consists of standing wave trains associated with the discrete spectrum and evolving wave packets associated with the continuous spectrum. Away from the obstacle, the velocity amplitudes of wave packets decay, but their vertical gradients grow in the horizontal direction--in contrast to a single-wave number solution attracted towards a particular critical level. Finally, we derive a formula for the net barotropic-to-baroclinic energy conversion rate, extending the classical one by incorporating the contributions from both the discrete and continuous spectra.</description>

      <title>Marangoni-driven flow instability accelerates liquid-solid contact on atomically smooth mica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A droplet falling toward a solid surface displaces the surrounding air until it encounters a defect, and contact nucleates. On atomically smooth surfaces devoid of defects, contact can be delayed until the droplet rebounds; however, above a critical impact velocity the droplet always contacts the surface. Here we show that for alcohol droplets in a humid atmosphere, the surface of the droplet above the solid develops patterns as a consequence of an instability; consequently, the liquid approaches the surface more closely in some places than others, accelerating contact formation. We demonstrate the attenuation and even suppression of this instability by varying the liquid composition, and characterize the growth rate and length scale of the patterns on liquid-air interface.</description>

      <title>Computational Assessment of Hemodynamics in Asymmetric-type Lesion of Idealized Coronary Stenoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary artery stenosis, characterized by the narrowing of the lumen, significantly affects blood flow and contributes to the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This study investigates the hemodynamics of coronary artery models with varying stenosis configurations, all maintaining an 80% lumen reduction, to determine how differences in morphology influence flow behavior and mechanical stresses. We employed computational fluid dynamics to analyze five idealized geometries with (10% &amp; 70%), (20% &amp; 60%), (30% &amp; 50%), (40% &amp; 40%), and (0% &amp; 80%) stenosis configurations. Through physiological pulsatile flow conditions, we evaluated key hemodynamic pattern including velocity profiles, wall shear stress, and pressure distribution. Our results reveal that despite the same degree of lumen reduction, each stenosis configuration produced distinct flow patterns and hemodynamic profiles. Asymmetric configurations, such as 10% &amp; 70% and 20% &amp; 60%, exhibited pronounced flow disruptions and higher wall shear stress at the stenosis throats, while symmetric configurations, such as 40% &amp; 40%, demonstrated more uniform flow and reduced vortex. Our findings challenge the practice of generalizing results across stenosis configurations without accounting for morphological variations, which is prevalent in many CFD studies using idealized models. This study emphasizes the importance of considering stenosis-specific morphology in CFD analyses and clinical interpretations to enhance the accuracy of diagnostic tools, improve personalized treatment planning, and guide the design of medical devices such as stents.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Vortex Shedding in Superfluid $^4$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During this internship, the starting vortex and its shedding from the trailing edge of an airfoil moving at constant acceleration in $^4$He has been studied. The airfoil has an angle of attack of 49.1{\deg} and corresponds to the NACA 0012, in contrast to most of the simulations using an angle of attack of 90{\deg} with a flat plate. An optical access combined with force and torque sensors enabled the study of this phenomenon. Particles are added to the fluid andfrom their position and velocity we obtained an estimate of the vorticity field. A tracking algorithm could then detect and track the vortex. From this tracking, we found no difference in the behaviour of the vortices in HeI and HeII. Furthermore, the trajectories do not correspond to the theoretical expectations, exhibiting straight trajectories until the vortex is independant of the airfoil, when a deviation in the trajectory happens. The vortex also moves faster than predicted. The differences are attributed to viscous and 3D effects.</description>

      <title>Comparison of stochastic BGK and FP methods for the simulation of non-equilibrium multi-species molecular gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18599v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to limited possibilities of experimental investigations for non-equilibrium gas flows, numerical results are of highest interest. Although the well-established Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method achieves highly accurate solutions, the computational requirements increase excessively for lower Knudsen regimes. Computationally more efficient simulations can be achieved with stochastic continuum-based methods using either the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) or the Fokker-Planck (FP) approximations where, instead of particle collisions, particle relaxation processes are considered. This paper explains the implementation of different stochastic BGK and FP methods in the open-source particle code PICLas for multi-species molecular gas flows. For verification, the results of different test cases are compared.</description>

      <title>From non-equilibrium Green functions to Lattice Wigner: A toy model for quantum nanofluidics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a dramatic reduction of friction due to the coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum-nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the wavelength of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Image Velocimetry using Direct Displacement Field estimation with Neural Networks for Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important tool for experimental fluids mechanics research is Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Several robust methodologies have been proposed to perform the estimation of velocity field from the images, however, alternative methods are still needed to increase the spatial resolution of the results. This work presents a novel approach for estimating fluid flow fields using neural networks and the optical flow equation to predict displacement vectors between sequential images. The result is a continuous representation of the displacement, that can be evaluated on the full spatial resolution of the image. The methodology was validated on synthetic and experimental images. Accurate results were obtained in terms of the estimation of instantaneous velocity fields, and of the determined time average turbulence quantities and power spectral density. The methodology proposed differs of previous attempts of using machine learning for this task: it does not require any previous training, and could be directly used in any pair of images.</description>

      <title>Turbulence: A Nonequilibrium Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tools of quantum and statistical field theories have ben successfully ported to turbulence. Here, we review the key results of turbulence field theory. Thermalized spectrally-truncated Euler equation is described by \textit{equilibrium field theory}, in which the equipartitioned Fourier modes generate zero energy flux. In contrast, modelling of hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT), which has small viscosity, requires \textit{nonequilibrium field theory}. In HDT, the viscosity is renormalized using field theory that leads to wavenumber-dependent viscosity and energy spectrum. Field theory calculations also yields nonzero energy flux for HDT. These field theory computations have been generalized to other systems, e.g., passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics. In this review, we cover these aspects, along with a brief coverage of weak turbulence and intermittency.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Liouville models of multiphase flows with randomly forced inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eulerian-Lagrangian models of particle-laden (multiphase) flows describe fluid flow and particle dynamics in the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks respectively. Regardless of whether the flow is turbulent or laminar, the particle dynamics is stochastic because the suspended particles are subjected to random forces. We use a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), rather than a postulated constitutive law, to capture structural and parametric uncertainties in the particles' forcing. The stochastic particle dynamics is described by a joint probability density function (PDF) of a particle's position and velocity and random coefficients in the PCE. We deploy the method of distributions (MoD) to derive a deterministic (Liouville-type) partial-differential equation for this PDF. We reformulate this PDF equation in a Lagrangian form, obtaining PDF flow maps and tracing events and their probability in the phase space. That is accomplished via a new high-order spectral scheme, which traces, marginalizes and computes moments of the high-dimensional joint PDF and comports with high-order carrier-phase solvers. Our approach has lower computational cost than either high-order Eulerian solvers or Monte Carlo methods, is not subjected to a CFL condition, does not suffer from Gibbs oscillations and does not require (order-reducing) filtering and regularization techniques. These features are demonstrated on several test cases.</description>

      <title>Covariant algebraic Reynolds stress modelling of curvature effects in high-Reynolds-number Taylor--Couette turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generally covariant expressions of algebraic Reynolds stress models (ARSMs) for rotating or curved turbulent flows have been discussed. Nearly constant mean angular momentum profiles, which are widely observed in curved turbulent flows including the bulk region of Taylor--Couette (TC) flows, are employed to evaluate the performance of Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models. For high-Reynolds-number TC flows where the inner and outer cylinders are weakly counter-rotating and co-rotating, both the bulk and boundary layers become turbulent without Taylor rolls, referred to as the featureless ultimate regime (UR). Thus, we can examine the RANS models as a one-dimensional problem in the featureless UR of the TC turbulence. High-Reynolds-number experiments of TC turbulence are performed for reference, where the radius ratio is $\eta = r_\mathrm{in}/r_\mathrm{out} = 0.732$ and the angular velocity ratio $a = -\omega_\mathrm{out}/\omega_\mathrm{in}$ is in the range $-0.5 \le a \le 0.1$. Verification of the RANS based on the conventional ARSM suggests that convection of the Reynolds stress is essential for predicting the angular momentum profile. We introduce the Jaumann derivative as a covariant time derivative to develop ARSMs that incorporate the convection effect in a covariant manner. The proposed ARSM using the Jaumann derivative of the term composed of the strain and vorticity tensors successfully predicts the nearly constant mean angular momentum for a wide range of angular velocity ratios in the co-rotating case. The modelling approach incorporating time-derivative terms is a candidate for expressing curvature effects while satisfying the covariance of the Reynolds stress tensor.</description>

Detailed derivation shows the proposed equations have super-Burnett order for small Knudsen numbers, and the moment equations enjoy a symmetric structure. A new modification of Onsager boundary conditions is proposed to ensure stability as well as the removal of undesired boundary layers. Numerical examples of one-dimensional channel flows is conducted to verified our model.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric Dynamos Sustained by a Modified Ohm's Law in a Toroidal Volume</title>

Abstract: This work tackles a significant challenge in dynamo theory: the possibility of long-term amplification and maintenance of an axisymmetric magnetic field. We introduce a novel model that allows for non-trivial axially-symmetric steady-state solutions for the magnetic field, particularly when the dynamo operates primarily within a ``nearly-spherical'' toroidal volume inside a fluid shell surrounding a solid core. In this model, Ohm's law is generalized to include the dissipative force, arising from electron collisions, that tends to align the velocity of the shell with the rotational speed of the inner core and outer mantle. Our findings reveal that, in this context, Cowling's theorem and the neutral point argument are modified, leading to magnetic energy growth for a suitable choice of toroidal flow. The global equilibrium magnetic field that emerges from our model exhibits a dipolar character. The central insight of the model developed here is that if an additional force is incorporated into Ohm's law, symmetric dynamos become possible.</description>

      <title>Variational Multiscale Evolve and Filter Strategies for Convection-Dominated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolve-filter (EF) model is a filter-based numerical stabilization for under-resolved convection-dominated flows. EF is a simple, modular, and effective strategy for both full-order models (FOMs) and reduced-order models (ROMs). It is well-known, however, that when the filter radius is too large, EF can be overdiffusive and yield inaccurate results. To alleviate this, EF is usually supplemented with a relaxation step. The relaxation parameter, however, is very sensitive with respect to the model parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to alleviate the EF overdiffusivity for a large filter radius. Specifically, we leverage the variational multiscale (VMS) framework to separate the large resolved scales from the small resolved scales in the evolved velocity, and we use the filtered small scales to correct the large scales. Furthermore, in the new VMS-EF strategy, we use two different ways to decompose the evolved velocity: the VMS Evolve-Filter-Filter-Correct (VMS-EFFC) and the VMS Evolve-Postprocess-Filter-Correct (VMS-EPFC) algorithms. The new VMS-based algorithms yield significantly more accurate results than the standard EF in both the FOM and the ROM simulations of a flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 1000.</description>
