      <title>Disentangling spin excitation continua in classical and quantum magnets using 2D nonlinear spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) has traditionally been one of the primary methods for investigating quantum magnets, particularly in identifying a continuum of excitations as a hallmark of spin fractionalization in quantum spin liquids (QSLs). However, INS faces severe limitations due to its inability to distinguish between such QSL signatures and similar excitation continua arising from highly frustrated magnetic orders with large unit cells or classical spin liquids. In contrast, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nonlinear excitation dynamics, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these broad spectral features. In this paper, we utilize classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to explore the 2DCS responses of frustrated magnets with dominant Kitaev interactions. Comparing the classical and quantum versions of the pure Kitaev model our results indicate both clear similarities, in the form of sharp line features, and clear distinctions, in the locations of these features and in selection rules. Moreover, in the extended $K\Gamma\Gamma'$ model, we show that the 2DCS response of the Kitaev spin liquid is completely distinct from that of large unit cell magnetic orders, despite both generating a broad continuum in INS. Additionally, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of classical 2DCS to thermal fluctuations and discuss the potential significance of quantum coherence in experimental settings. Overall, our work illustrates the potential of 2DCS in resolving the complex physics underlying ambiguous spin excitation continua, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics in these frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Higgs Phases and Boundary Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work connecting Higgs phases to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, we investigate the interplay of gauge redundancy and global symmetry in lattice gauge theories with Higgs fields in the presence of a boundary. The core conceptual point is that a global symmetry associated to a Higgs field, which is pure-gauge in a closed system, acts physically at the boundary under boundary conditions which allow electric flux to escape the system. We demonstrate in both Abelian and non-Abelian models that this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the Higgs regime, implying the presence of gapless edge modes. Starting with the U(1) Abelian Higgs model in 4D, we demonstrate a boundary phase transition in the 3D XY universality class separating the bulk Higgs and confining regimes. Varying the boundary coupling while preserving the symmetries shifts the location of the boundary phase transition. We then consider non-Abelian gauge theories with fundamental and group-valued Higgs matter, and identify the analogous non-Abelian global symmetry acting on the boundary generated by the total color charge. For SU($N$) gauge theory with fundamental Higgs matter we argue for a boundary phase transition in the O($2N$) universality class, verified numerically for $N=2,3$. For group-valued Higgs matter, the boundary theory is a principal chiral model exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate this mechanism in theories with higher-form Higgs fields. We show how the higher-form matter symmetry acts at the boundary and can spontaneously break, exhibiting a boundary confinement-deconfinement transition. We also study the electric-magnetic dual theory, demonstrating a dual magnetic defect condensation transition at the boundary. We discuss some implications and extensions of these findings and what they may imply for the relation between Higgs and SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Exchange Interactions in Rare-earth Magnets $A_2$PrO$_3$ ($A$= alkali metals): Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth materials hold promise to realize exotic magnetic states owing to synergy between electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling. Recently, quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb magnets $A_2$PrO$_3$ ($A$ = alkali metals) were predicted to be good candidates for Kitaev quantum spin liquids, as the Kitaev-type bond-dependent anisotropic interactions dominate over bond-independent isotropic Heisenberg ones. However, experimental observations are negative, questioning the energy hierarchy in Pr$^{4+}$ ions assumed in the conjecture on the basis of the conventional Russell-Saunders coupling scheme. We here revisit the exchange interactions in these Pr compounds, by explicitly taking into account the ionic states beyond the assumption. We show that, while increasing the octahedral crystal field splitting, which was assumed to be negligibly small, relative to the spin-orbit coupling, the Kitaev-type interactions are suppressed to be subdominant compared to prevailing Heisenberg ones. Our finding compromises the contradiction as arising from the peculiar ionic state of the high valence Pr$^{4+}$.</description>

      <title>Six magnetization plateau phases in a kagome antiferromagnet with $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$-type distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently discovered kagome antiferromagnet $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ has attracted significant interest due to its unique kagome lattice structure and magnetic properties. Two separate studies have proposed distinct sets of exchange interaction parameters for this compound. In this study, we investigate the ground state of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg kagome model with three types of nearest-neighbor exchange interactions under a magnetic field by exact diagonalization using the Lanczos method. We reveal that clear magnetization plateaus at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9 are present under both parameter sets, which are identified as magnon crystal states based on their spin structures. Our findings suggest that these plateaus could potentially be experimentally confirmed with magnetization measurements on $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ under a magnetic field of approximately 300 T. Due to the uncertainty in the exchange interactions of $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$, we perform additional calculations by varying these interactions. Consequently, we discover additional plateau phases at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9, each distinctly different from the magnon crystal states.</description>

      <title>Weyl nodes in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ revealed by dynamical mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental studies have found unusual transport properties in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ which are potentially a consequence of the interplay between band-structure topology and electronic correlations. Based on these measurements, the existence of Weyl points in strongly renormalized, flat quasiparticle bands has been postulated. However, so far, there has been neither a direct spectroscopic observation of these, nor a calculation from first principles that would confirm their existence close to the Fermi energy. Here, we present density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations and study the low-energy excitations and their topological properties. We find that the Kondo effect promotes two out of the six angular momentum $J=5/2$ states, with the other four pushed to higher energies. Further, we find Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy as previously suggested for explaining the observed giant spontaneous Hall effect in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$, as well as nodal lines.</description>

      <title>Detailed dynamics of a moving magnetic skyrmion lattice in MnSi observed using a small-angle neutron scattering under an alternating electric current flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice formation of swirling textures is ubiquitous in solid-state materials, such as a magnetic skyrmion lattice in chiral magnets. In the magnetic skyrmion lattices, their moving states and dynamics under external perturbations are still unrevealed, although a detailed understanding of the dynamics is crucial to realizing spintronic applications, such as magnetic domain-wall racetrack memory. Here, we report in detail on the transient state of a moving magnetic skyrmion lattice in bulk single-crystalline MnSi under alternating current (AC) using small-angle neutron scattering. A rotation and concomitant broadening of the spot width in the azimuthal direction of the magnetic skyrmion reflections originating from the plastic deformation of the magnetic skyrmion lattice were found only at low AC frequencies, whereas above the threshold AC frequency (ft ~ 0.12 Hz) the rotation was not observed, and the spot width becomes sharper. The observed complex response of the magnetic skyrmion reflections can be explained by the change in dislocation density in the magnetic skyrmion lattice. At frequencies higher than ft, the magnetic skyrmions oscillate removing the dislocations, indicating that the dislocation density is controlled by the AC frequency.</description>

      <title>Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify (\emph{herald}) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.</description>

      <title>Finite-Depth Preparation of Tensor Network States from Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although tensor network states constitute a broad range of exotic quantum states, their realization is challenging and often requires resources whose depth scales with system size. In this work, we explore criteria on the local tensors for enabling deterministic state preparation via a single round of measurements and on-site unitary feedback. We use these criteria to construct families of measurement-preparable states in one and two dimensions, tuning between distinct symmetry-breaking, symmetry-protected, and intrinsic topological phases of matter. For instance, in one dimension we chart out a three-parameter family of preparable states which interpolate between the AKLT, cluster, GHZ and other states of interest. Our protocol even allows one to engineer preparable quantum states with a range of desired correlation lengths and entanglement properties. In addition to such constructive approaches, we present diagnostics for verifying whether a given tensor network state is preparable using measurements. We conclude by charting out generalizations, such as considering multiple rounds of measurements, implementing matrix product operators, and using incomplete basis measurements.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Anomalies of QCD$_3$ and QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetry provide powerful tool to constrain the dynamics of quantum systems, such as anomaly matching in the renormalization group flow and obstruction to symmetric mass generation. In this note we compute the anomalies in 2+1d time-reversal symmetric gauge theories with massless fermions in the fundamental and rank-two tensor representations, where the gauge groups are $SU(N),SO(N),Sp(N),U(1)$. The fermion parity is part of the gauge group and the theories are bosonic. The time-reversal symmetry satisfies $T^2=1$ or $T^2={\cal M}$ where ${\cal M}$ is an internal magnetic symmetry.
  We show that some of the bosonic gauge theories have time-reversal anomaly with $c_-\neq 0$ mod 8 that is absent in fermionic systems. The anomalies of the gauge theories can be nontrivial even when the number of Majorana fermions is a multiple of 16 and $\nu=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the vestigial phase with broken time-reversal symmetry above the superconducting transition temperature of a two-component superconductor in two spatial dimensions. We show that, in contrast to 3D, a vestigial phase is in general allowed within Ginzburg-Landau theory. The vestigial phase occupies an increasing temperature region if the parameters in the Ginzburg-Landau theory gives a larger energy difference between the broken time reversal symmetry phase and the other ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Walking behavior induced by $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking in a non-Hermitian $\rm XY$ model with clock anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum system governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian may exhibit zero temperature phase transitions that are driven by interactions, just as its Hermitian counterpart, raising the fundamental question how non-Hermiticity affects quantum criticality. In this context we consider a non-Hermitian system consisting of an $\rm XY$ model with a complex-valued four-state clock interaction that may or may not have parity-time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. When the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is broken, and time-evolution becomes non-unitary, a scaling behavior similar to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition ensues, but in a highly unconventional way, as the line of fixed points is absent. From the analysis of the $d$-dimensional RG equations, we obtain that the unconventional behavior in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken regime follows from the collision of two fixed points in the $d\to 2$ limit, leading to walking behavior or pseudocriticality. For $d=2+1$ the near critical behavior is characterized by a correlation length exponent $\nu=3/8$, a value smaller than the mean-field one. These results are in sharp contrast with the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case where only one fixed point arises for $2&lt;d&lt;4$ and in $d=1+1$ three lines of fixed points occur with a continuously varying critical exponent $\nu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials feature multiple electronic orbitals which are crucial to accurately understand their many-body properties, from cuprate materials to twisted bilayer graphene. In such multi-band models, quantum interference can lead to dispersionless bands whose large degeneracy gives rise to itinerant magnetism even with weak interactions. Here, we report on signatures of a ferrimagnetic state realized in a Lieb lattice at half-filling, characterized by antialigned magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic correlations, concomitant with a finite spin polarization. We demonstrate its robustness when increasing repulsive interactions from the non-interacting to the Heisenberg regime, and study its emergence when continuously tuning the lattice unit cell from a square to a Lieb geometry. Our work paves the way towards exploring exotic phases in related multi-orbital models such as quantum spin liquids in kagome lattices and heavy fermion behavior in Kondo models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by discrepancies between recent cold atom experiments and the associated theory, we explore the effect of immobile holes on the quantum dynamics of $x$-$z$ spin helices in the one-dimensional $XX$ model. We calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with nearest neighbor interactions. Based on matrix product state simulations and symmetry considerations, we find evidence that, with ferromagnetic isotropic couplings, the model realizes a chiral spin liquid, characterized by a possible $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ chiral topological order. This is supported by simulations on both cylinder and strip geometries. On infinitely long cylinders with various widths, scaling analysis of entanglement entropy and maximal correlation length suggests that the model has a gapped 2D bulk. The topological entanglement entropy is extracted and found to be in agreement with the $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ topological order. On infinitely long strips with moderate widths, we find the model is critical with a central charge consistent with the chiral edge theory of the $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ topological phase. We conclude by discussing several open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elementary point charge excitations in 3+1D topological phases can condense along a line and form a descendant excitation called the Cheshire string. Unlike the elementary flux loop excitations in the system, Cheshire strings do not have to appear as the boundary of a 2d disc and can exist on open line segments. On the other hand, Cheshire strings are different from trivial excitations that can be created with local unitaries in 0d and finite depth quantum circuits in 1d and higher. In this paper, we show that to create a Cheshire string, one needs a linear depth circuit that acts sequentially along the length of the string. Once a Cheshire string is created, its deformation, movement and fusion can be realized by finite depths circuits. This circuit depth requirement applies to all nontrivial descendant excitations including symmetry-protected topological chains and the Majorana chain.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions out of quantum Hall states in moir\'e materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10903v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental breakthroughs in observing Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in moir\'e materials, we propose and study various unconventional phase transitions between quantum Hall phases and Fermi liquids or charge ordered phases upon tuning the bandwidth. At a fixed rational lattice filling $\nu$, we describe a quantum Ginzburg-Landau theory to describe the intertwinement between the FQAH and Charge Density Wave (CDW) orders. We use this theory to describe phase transitions between the FQAH and a CDW insulator. The critical theory for a direct second order transition resembles that of the familiar deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) but with an additional Chern-Simons term. At filling -1/2, we study the possibility of a continuous transition between the composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and the Fermi liquid (FL) building on and refining previous work by Barkeshli and McGreevy. Crucially we show that filling constraints ignored in that work ensure that translation symmetry alone is enough to enable a second order CFL-FL transition. We argue that there must be critical CDW fluctuations though neither phase has long range CDW order. We present experimental signatures the most striking of which is a universal jump of both longitudinal and Hall resistivities at the critical point. With disorder, we argue that the CDW order gets pinned and the CFL-FL evolution happens through an intermediate electrically insulating phase with mobile neutral fermions. A clean analog of this insulating phase with long range CDW order and a neutral fermi surface can potentially also exist. We also present a critical theory for the CFL to FL transition at filling -3/4. Our work opens up a new avenue to realize deconfined criticality and fractionalized phases beyond familiar Landau level physics in the moire Chern band system.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Magnon-Polariton spectroscopy of strongly hybridized electro-nuclear spin excitations in LiHoF4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first present a formalism that incorporates the input-output formalism and the linear response theory to employ cavity-magnon-polariton coupling as a spectroscopic tool for investigating strongly hybridized electro-nuclear spin excitations. A microscopic relation between the generalized susceptibility and the scattering parameter |S11| in strongly hybridized cavity-magnon-polariton systems has been derived without resorting to semi-classical approximations. The formalism is then applied to both analyze and simulate a specific systems comprising a model quantum Ising magnet (LiHoF4) and a high-finesse 3D re-entrant cavity resonator. Quantitative information on the electro-nuclear spin states in LiHoF4 is extracted, and the experimental observations across a broad parameter range were numerically reproduced, including an external magnetic field titraversing a quantum critical point. The method potentially opens a new avenue not only for further studies on the quantum phase transition in LiHoF4 but also for a wide range of complex magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Continuum excitations in a spin-supersolid on a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic, thermodynamic, neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering are used to study spin correlations in the easy-axis XXZ triangular lattice magnet K2Co(SeO3)2. Despite the presence of quasi-2D "supersolid" magnetic order, the low-energy excitation spectrum contains no sharp modes and is instead a broad and structured multi-particle continuum. Applying a weak magnetic field drives the system into an m = 1/3 fractional magnetization plateau phase and restores sharp spin wave modes. To some extent, the behavior at zero field can be understood in terms of spin wave decay. However, the presence of clear excitation minima at the M-points of the Brillouin zone suggest that the spinon language may provide a more adequate description, and signals a possible proximity to a Dirac spin liquid state.</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation of topological chiral spin liquids via Floquet engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In condensed matter, Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Quantum Hall states (in the continuum) or Fractional Chern Insulators (on the lattice). As the latter, CSL are remarquable states of matter, exhibiting topological order and chiral edge modes. Preparing CSL on quantum simulators like cold atom platforms is still an open challenge. Here we propose a simple setup on a finite cluster of spin-1/2 located at the sites of a square lattice. Using a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) non-chiral spin liquid as initial state on which fast time-modulations of strong nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings are applied, following different protocols (out-of-equilibrium quench or semi-adiabatic ramping of the drive), we show the slow emergence of such a CSL phase. An effective Floquet dynamics, obtained from a high-frequency Magnus expansion of the drive Hamiltonian, provides a very accurate and simple framework fully capturing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. An analysis of the resulting prepared states in term of Projected Entangled Pair states gives further insights on the topological nature of the chiral phase. Finally, we discuss possible applications to quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The effect of Coulomb assisted hopping on STM signal: extended two site Hubbard model analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study STM signal in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping. We perform an extended two site Hubbard model analysis between the atom on the tip and the atom in the sample nearest to each other. We show that in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping the STM signal depends on several spectral functions thereby complicating its interpretation. Furthermore in the broadband tip limit there are now three different competing rates for the total current (instead of one for the usual two site Hubbard model analysis used in the literature so far). We find an exact (within the Fermi golden rule - that is in the limit of weak coupling between tip and sample) expression for the current as a function of the bias voltage. As an example we apply our calculations to the case of free fermions with a uniform density of states. Even in this simple case there are non-trivial corrections - where the $dI/d\mathcal{V}$ (the rate of change of the current with respect to bias voltage) is not uniform as a two site (non-extended) Hubbard model analysis would predict. We also show that for realistic conditions the corrections predicted here are order one.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach for cluster perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach (ChePSMPS) as a solver for cluster perturbation theory (CPT), crucial for simulating spectral functions in two-dimensional electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling systems. ChePSMPS distinguishes itself from conventional exact diagonalization solvers by supporting larger clusters, thereby significantly mitigating finite-size effects. Free from the fermion sign problem, ChePSMPS enhances its ability to explore $e$-ph effects and generate high-resolution spectral functions in doped Mott insulators. We use this method to simulate the spectra for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein models, highlighting its superiority over other methods. Our findings validate ChePSMPS as a powerful and reliable Green's function solver. In conjunction with embedding methods, ChePSMPS emerges as an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated $e$-ph coupling systems.</description>

      <title>Direct transition from a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with the same Hall conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance and broken translational symmetry has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling $\nu$ = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Engineering underdoped CuO$_2$ nanoribbons in nm-thick $a$-axis YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In underdoped cuprate high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductors, various local orders and symmetry breaking states, in addition to superconductivity, reside in the CuO$_2$ planes. The confinement of the CuO$_2$ planes can therefore play a fundamental role in modifying the hierarchy between the various orders and their intertwining with superconductivity. Here we present the growth of $a$-axis oriented YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films, spanning the whole underdoped side of the phase diagram. In these samples, the CuO$_2$ planes are confined by the film thickness, effectively forming unit-cell-thick nanoribbons. The unidirectional confinement at the nanoscale enhances the in-plane anisotropy of the films. By X-ray diffraction and resistance vs temperature measurements, we have discovered the suppression of the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition at low dopings, and a very high anisotropy of the normal state resistance in the $b$-$c$ plane, the latter being connected to a weak coupling between adjacent CuO$_2$ nanoribbons. These findings show that the samples we have grown represent a novel system, different from the bulk, where future experiments can possibly shed light on the rich and mysterious physics occurring within the CuO$_2$ planes.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we propose an exotic quantum state which does not order at zero temperature in a Rydberg atom array with antiblockade mechanism. By performing an unbiased large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate a minimal model with facilitated excitation in a disorder-free system. At zero temperature, this model exhibits a heterogeneous structure of liquid and glass mixture. This state, dubbed quantum slush state, features a quasi-long-range order with an algebraic decay for its correlation function, and is different from most well-established quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>An Effective Theory for Graphene Nanoribbons with Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum electronics. In this scenario, qubits are realised by localised states that can emerge on junctions in hybrid ribbons formed by two armchair nanoribbons of different widths. We derive an effective theory based on a tight-binding ansatz for the description of hybrid nanoribbons and use it to make accurate predictions of the energy gap and nature of the localisation in various hybrid nanoribbon geometries. We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that the effective theory remains applicable in the presence of Hubbard interactions. We discover, in addition to the well known localisations on junctions, which we call `Fuji', a new type of `Kilimanjaro' localisation smeared out over a segment of the hybrid ribbon. We show that Fuji localisations in hybrids of width $N$ and $N+2$ armchair nanoribbons occur around symmetric junctions if and only if $N\pmod3=1$, while edge-aligned junctions never support strong localisation. This behaviour cannot be explained relying purely on the topological $Z_2$ invariant, which has been believed the origin of the localisations to date.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>
