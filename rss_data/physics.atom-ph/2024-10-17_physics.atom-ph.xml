      <title>Molecular Quantum Control Algorithm Design by Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of polyatomic molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in a single, pure quantum state. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated in the case of a CaH$^+$ ion, with up to 96 thermally populated eigenstates and under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. We expect that the method developed, with physics-informed learning, will be directly implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>

      <title>Realization of three and four-body interactions between momentum states in a cavity through optical dressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paradigmatic spin Hamiltonians in condensed matter and quantum sensing typically utilize pair-wise or 2-body interactions between constituents in the material or ensemble. However, there is growing interest in exploring more general $n$-body interactions for $n &gt;2$, with examples including more efficient quantum gates or the realization of exotic many-body fracton states. Here we realize an effective $n=3$-body Hamiltonian interaction using an ensemble of laser-cooled atoms in a high finesse optical cavity with the pseudo-spin 1/2 encoded by two atomic momentum states. To realize this interaction, we apply two dressing tones that coax the atoms to exchange photons via the cavity to realize a virtual 6-photon process, while the lower-order interactions destructively interfere. The resulting photon mediated interactions are not only $n&gt;2$-body but also all-to-all(-to-all) and therefore of great interest for fast entanglement generation and quantum simulation of exotic phases such as the long sought but not yet observed charge-Qe superconductors, with $Q=2n$ . The versatility of our experimental system can also allow for extending to 3-body interactions in multi-level systems or to higher-order interactions, such as the signature of a $n=4$-body interaction mediated by a virtual eight photon process that we also observe.</description>

      <title>Mitigating higher-band heating in Floquet-Hubbard lattices via two-tone driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-photon resonances to high-lying energy levels represent an unavoidable source of Floquet heating in strongly driven quantum systems. In this work, we extend the recently developed two-tone approach of 'cancelling' multi-photon resonances to shaken lattices in the Hubbard regime. Our experiments show that even for strong lattice shaking the inclusion of a weak second drive leads to cancellation of multi-photon heating resonances. Surprisingly, the optimal cancelling amplitude depends on the Hubbard interaction strength $U$, in qualitative agreement with exact diagonalisation calculations. Our results call for novel analytical approaches to capture the physics of strongly-driven-strongly-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical self-organization in a mesoscopic atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in modern physics is bridging the gap between an exact description of few-body microscopic systems and the emergent description of many-body macroscopic systems. This gap may be bridged by tracing the properties of well-controlled intermediate-size mesoscopic systems. Here, we study mesoscopic signatures of a spatial self-organization phase transition in deterministically prepared arrays of between 10 and 22 atoms inside an optical cavity. Through precise engineering of the atom-cavity interactions, we reveal how critical behavior depends on atom number. We identify characteristic dynamical behaviors related to symmetry breaking and system size in the self-organized regime, and observe a finite optomechanical susceptibility at the critical point. This work opens the door to probing particle-number- and time-resolved properties of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency based laser lock to Zeeman sublevels with 0.6 GHz scanning range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a technique for frequency locking a laser to the Zeeman sublevel transitions between the 5P$_{3/2}$ intermediate and 32D$_{5/2}$ Rydberg states in $^{87}$Rb. This method allows for continuous frequency tuning over 0.6 GHz by varying an applied external magnetic field. In the presence of the applied field, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of an atomic vapor splits via the Zeeman effect according to the strength of the magnetic field and the polarization of the pump and probe lasers. We show that the 480 nm pump laser, responsible for transitions between the Zeeman sublevels of the intermediate state and the Rydberg state, can be locked to the Zeeman-split EIT peaks. The short-term frequency stability of the laser lock is 0.15 MHz and the long-term stability is within 0.5 MHz. The linewidth of the laser lock is ~0.8 MHz and ~1.8 MHz in the presence and in the absence of the external magnetic field, respectively. In addition, we show that in the absence of an applied magnetic field and adequate shielding, the frequency shift of the lock point has a peak-to-peak variation of 1.6 MHz depending on the polarization of the pump field, while when locked to Zeeman sublevels this variation is reduced to 0.6 MHz. The proposed technique is useful for research involving Rydberg atoms, where large continuous tuning of the laser frequency with stable locking is required.</description>

      <title>Primary quantum thermometry of mm-wave blackbody radiation via induced state transfer in Rydberg states of cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg states of alkali atoms are highly sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the GHz-to-THz regime because their transitions have large electric dipole moments. Consequently, environmental blackbody radiation (BBR) can couple Rydberg states together at $\mu$s timescales. Here, we track the BBR-induced transfer of a prepared Rydberg state to its neighbors and use the evolution of these state populations to characterize the BBR field at the relevant wavelengths, primarily at 130 GHz. We use selective field ionization readout of Rydberg states with principal quantum number $n\sim30$ in $^{85}$Rb and substantiate our ionization signal with a theoretical model. With this detection method, we measure the associated blackbody-radiation-induced time dynamics of these states, reproduce the results with a simple semi-classical population transfer model, and demonstrate that this measurement is temperature sensitive with a statistical sensitivity to the fractional temperature uncertainty of 0.09 Hz$^{-1/2}$, corresponding to 26 K$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ at room temperature. This represents a calibration-free SI-traceable temperature measurement, for which we calculate a systematic fractional temperature uncertainty of 0.006, corresponding to 2 K at room temperature when used as a primary temperature standard.</description>

      <title>Collisional Cooling of Ultracold Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.09630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the original work on Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum degenerate gases of atoms have allowed the quantum emulation of important systems from condensed matter and nuclear physics, as well as the study of novel many-body states with no analog in other fields of physics. Ultracold molecules in the micro- and nano-Kelvin regimes promise to bring powerful new capabilities to quantum emulation and quantum computing, thanks to their rich internal degrees of freedom compared to atoms. They also open new possibilities for precision measurement and the study of quantum chemistry. Quantum gases of atoms were made possible by collision-based cooling schemes, such as evaporative cooling. For ultracold molecules, thermalization and collisional cooling have not been realized. With other techniques such as supersonic jets and cryogenic buffer gases, studies have been limited to temperatures above 10 mK. Here we show cooling of NaLi molecules at micro- and nano-Kelvin temperatures through collisions with ultracold Na atoms, both prepared in their stretched hyperfine spin states. We find a lower bound on the elastic to inelastic collision ratio between molecules and atoms greater than 50 -- large enough to support sustained collisional cooling. By employing two stages of evaporation, we increase the phase-space density (PSD) of the molecules by a factor of 20, achieving temperatures as low as 220 nK. The favorable collisional properties of a Na and NaLi mixture show great promise for making deeply quantum degenerate dipolar molecules and suggest the potential for such cooling in other systems.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cavity Resonator with Electromagnetic Induced Absorption to Enable a Test of the Electric-Scalar Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cylindrical microwave cavity resonator operating in the TM$_{0,1,0}$ mode was excited using an interferometric configuration that allowed manipulation of the electric field and potential within the resonator by adjusting the phase and amplitude in the two interferometer arms driving the resonator. With precise tuning of the phase and amplitude, 25 dB suppression of the electric field at the resonance frequency was achieved while simultaneously resonantly enhancing the amplitude of the time-varying electric-scalar potential. Under these balanced conditions, the system demonstrated electromagnetically induced absorption in the cavity response due to the annulment of the electric field at the resonance frequency. This phenomena can be regarded as a form of extreme dispersion, and led to a measured increase in the cavity phase response by an order of magnitude. This work presents an experimental setup with the features that will allow the electric-scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect to be tested under conditions involving a time-varying electric-scalar potential, without the presence of an electric field or magnetic vector potential, an experiment that has not yet been realised.</description>
