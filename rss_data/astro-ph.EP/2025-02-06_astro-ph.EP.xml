      <title>Development of Radar and Optical Tracking of Near-Earth Asteroids at the University of Tasmania</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail the use of the University of Tasmania's (UTAS) optical and radio telescopes to conduct observations of near-Earth asteroids from 2021 to 2024. The Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex transmitted a radio signal at 7159.45 MHz, with the radar echo detected by the UTAS radio telescopes. The method of accounting for the Doppler shift between the stations and the near-Earth object is described so that others can implement a similar program. We present our results, with confirmed detections of 1994 PC1 and 2003 UC20 asteroids using the Hobart and Katherine 12-m antennas, demonstrating the feasibility of using small radio telescopes for these observations. Additionally, the recently upgraded Ceduna 30 m antenna was used to detect 2024 MK. Data collected from other observatories, such as Tidbinbilla, as well as the UTAS radar tracking of the moon are also presented in the context of demonstrating the means of applying these Doppler corrections and the accuracy of each method. Optical observations conducted in this period are also detailed as they complement radar observations and aid in refining the orbit parameters.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Bouncing Barrier with Collision Simulations of Compressed Dust Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of Interstellar Material Delivery: {\alpha} Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar material has been discovered in our Solar System, yet its origins and details of its transport are unknown. Here we present $\alpha$ Centauri as a case study of the delivery of interstellar material to our Solar System. $\alpha$ Centauri is a mature triple star system that likely harbours planets and is moving towards us with the point of closest approach approximately 28,000 years in the future. Assuming a current ejection model for the system, we find that such material can reach our Solar System and may currently be present here. The material that does reach us is mostly a product of low ($&lt;2$ km/s) ejection velocities, and the rate at which it enters our Solar System is expected to peak around the time of $\alpha$ Centauri 's closest approach. If $\alpha$ Centauri ejects material at a rate comparable to our own Solar System, we estimate the current number of $\alpha$ Centauri particles larger than 100 m in diameter within our Oort Cloud to be $10^{6}$, and during $\alpha$ Centauri 's closest approach, this will increase by an order of magnitude. However, the observable fraction of such objects remains low as there is only a probability of $10^{-6}$ that one of them is within 10 au of the Sun. A small number ($\sim 10$) meteors greater than 100 micrometers from $\alpha$ Centauri may currently be entering Earth's atmosphere every year: this number is very sensitive to the assumed ejected mass distribution, but the flux is expected to increase as $\alpha$ Centauri approaches.</description>

      <title>Configuration of Single Giant Planet Systems Generating `Oumuamua-Like Interstellar Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first discovered interstellar small object, `Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1), presents unique physical properties of extremely elongated geometric shape and dual characteristics of an asteroid and a comet. These properties suggest a possible origin through tidal fragmentation, which posits that `Oumuamua was produced through intensive tidal fragmentation during a close encounter with a star or a white dwarf, resulting in its shape and ejection from its natal system. According to this mechanism, a high initial orbit eccentricity and a small pericentre of the parent body are necessary to produce `Oumuamua-like objects. To verify whether this mechanism can occur in single giant planet systems, we conduct long-term numerical simulations of systems with a low-mass ($0.5M_\odot$) host star and a giant planet in this study. We determine that an eccentric orbit ($e_\mathrm{p}\sim0.2$) and a Jupiter-mass ($M_\mathrm{p}\sim M_\mathrm{J}$) of the planet appears to be optimal to generate sufficient perturbations for the production of `Oumuamua-like objects. When the planetary semi-major axis $a_\mathrm{p}$ increases, the proportion of planetesimals ejected beyond the system $P(\mathrm{ej})$ increases accordingly, while the possibilities of ejected planetesimals undergoing stellar tidal fragmentation $P(\mathrm{tidal}|\mathrm{ej})$ remains relatively constant at $\sim0.6\%$. Focusing on stellar tidal fragmentation alone, the ratio of extremely elongated interstellar objects to all interstellar objects is $P_\mathrm{e}\sim3\%$.</description>

      <title>Classical 1/3 Nusselt number scaling in highly turbulent compressible convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary and stellar convection, which are compressible and turbulent, remain poorly understood. In this paper, we report numerical results on the scaling of Nusselt number ($\mathrm{Nu}$) and Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re}$) for extreme convection. Using computationally-efficient MacCormack-TVD finite difference method, we simulate compressible turbulent convection in a two-dimensional Cartesian box up to $\mathrm{Ra} = 10^{16}$, the highest $\mathrm{Ra}$ achieved so far, and in a three-dimensional box up to $\mathrm{Ra} = 10^{11}$. We show adiabatic temperature drop in the bulk flow, leading to the Reynolds number scaling $\mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$. More significantly, we show classical $1/3$ Nusselt number scaling: $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{0.32}$ in 2D, and $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{0.31}$ in 3D up to the highest $\mathrm{Ra}$.</description>

      <title>Earth Detecting Earth: At what distance could Earth's constellation of technosignatures be detected with present-day technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) searches for ``technosignatures'' that could provide the first detection of life beyond Earth through the technology that an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) may have created. Any given SETI survey, if no technosignatures are detected, should set upper limits based on the kinds of technosignatures it should have been able to detect; the sensitivity of many SETI searches requires that their target sources (e.g., Dyson spheres or Kardashev II/III level radio transmitters) emit with power far exceeding the kinds of technology humans have developed. In this paper, we instead turn our gaze Earthward, minimizing the axis of extrapolation by only considering transmission and detection methods commensurate with an Earth-2024 level. We evaluate the maximum distance of detectability for various present-day Earth technosignatures -- radio transmissions, atmospheric technosignatures, optical and infrared signatures, and objects in space or on planetary surfaces -- using only present-day Earth instruments, providing one of the first fully cross-wavelength comparisons of the growing toolbox of SETI techniques. In this framework, we find that Earth's space-detectable signatures span 13 orders of magnitude in detectability, with intermittent, celestially-targeted radio transmission (i.e., planetary radar) beating out its nearest non-radio competitor by a factor of $10^3$ in detection distance. This work highlights the growing range of ways that exoplanet technosignatures may be expressed, the growing complexity and visibility of the human impact upon our planet, and the continued importance of the radio frequencies in SETI.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning as a profound manifestation of the Dark Matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ball lighting (BL) has been observed for centuries. There are large number of books, review articles, and original scientific papers devoted to different aspects of BL phenomenon. Yet, the basic features of this phenomenon have never been explained by known physics. The main problem is the source which could power the dynamics of the BL. We advocate an idea that the dark matter in form of the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate the required power. The corresponding macroscopically large object in form of the AQN behaves as {\it chameleon}: it does not interact with the surrounding material in dilute environment and serves as perfect cold DM candidate. However, AQN becomes strongly interacting object in sufficiently dense environment. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to the BL physics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the observed similarity $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ between visible and DM components. This relation represents a very generic feature of this framework, not sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with the same set of parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to address the key elements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the energy powering the BL events. In particular, we argue that the visible size of BL, its typical life time, the frequency of appearance , etc are all consistent with suggested proposal when BL represents a profound manifestation of the DM physics represented by the AQN objects. We also formulate a unique possible test which can refute or unambiguously substantiate this unorthodox proposal on nature of BL.</description>

      <title>Changing disc compositions via internal photoevaporation I: Solar-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chemical evolution of protoplanetary discs is not fully understood, several factors influence the final distribution of disc material. One such factor are inward drifting and evaporating pebbles that enrich the inner disc with vapour. In particular, it is first enriched with water vapour, resulting in a low C/O ratio, before carbon-rich gas from the outer disc is transported inwards elevating the C/O ratio again. However, it is unclear how internal photoevaporation, which carries away gas and opens gaps that block inward drifting pebbles, affects the chemical composition of the disc. We aim to study these effects in discs around solar-like stars, where we especially focus on the C/O ratio and the water content. The simulations are carried out using a semi-analytical 1D disc model. Our code chemcomp includes viscous evolution and heating, pebble growth and drift, pebble evaporation and condensation, and a simple chemical partitioning model. We show that internal photoevaporation plays a major role in the (chemical) evolution of protoplanetary discs: As it opens a gap, inward drifting pebbles are stopped and cannot contribute to the volatile content any more. In addition, gas from the outer disc is carried away by photoevaporative winds. Consequently, the C/O ratio in the inner disc is low. In contrast, gaps opened by giant planets allow the gas to pass, resulting in an elevated C/O ratio, similar to viscous discs without internal photoevaporation. This will enable us to distinguish observationally between these two scenarios when measuring the C/O ratio, implying that we can infer the cause of gap structures in disc observations. In the case of a photoevaporative disc, we additionally find an elevated water content in the inner disc as the water vapour and ice undergo a cycle of evaporation/re-condensation, preventing its inward accretion onto the star.</description>

      <title>Use the 4S (Signal-Safe Speckle Subtraction): Explainable Machine Learning reveals the Giant Exoplanet AF Lep b in High-Contrast Imaging Data from 2011</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main challenge of exoplanet high-contrast imaging (HCI) is to separate the signal of exoplanets from their host stars, which are many orders of magnitude brighter. HCI for ground-based observations is further exacerbated by speckle noise originating from perturbations in Earth's atmosphere and imperfections in the telescope optics. Various data post-processing techniques are used to remove this speckle noise and reveal the faint planet signal. Often, however, a significant part of the planet signal is accidentally subtracted together with the noise. In the present work, we use explainable machine learning to investigate the reason for the loss of the planet signal for one of the most used post-processing methods: principal component analysis (PCA). We find that PCA learns the shape of the telescope point spread function for high numbers of PCA components. This representation of the noise captures not only the speckle noise but also the characteristic shape of the planet signal. Building on these insights, we develop a new post-processing method (4S) that constrains the noise model to minimize this signal loss. We apply our model to 11 archival HCI datasets from the VLT-NACO instrument in the L'-band and find that our model consistently outperforms PCA. The improvement is largest at close separations to the star ($\leq 4 \lambda /D$) providing up to 1.5 magnitudes deeper contrast. This enhancement enables us to detect the exoplanet AF Lep b in data from 2011, 11 years before its subsequent discovery. We present updated orbital parameters for this object.</description>

      <title>Hidden under a warm blanket: If planets existed in protostellar disks, they would hardly produce observable substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The onset of planet formation is actively under debate. Recent mass measurements of disks around protostars suggest an early start of planet formation in the Class 0/I disks. However, dust substructures, one possible signature of forming planets, are rarely observed in the young Class 0/I disks, while they are ubiquitous in the mature Class II disks. It is not clear whether the lack of dust substructures in the Class 0/I disks indicates absence of planets or whether it is due to other physical effects such as temperature and dust opacity. Here we consider the effect of temperature on the ability of planets to produce dust substructures. We prescribe the evolution of the disk and the protostar from Class 0 to Class II phase and calculate the disk temperature using radiative transfer models at various stages of the evolution. We use the mid-plane temperature to calculate the disk scale height and the minimum planet mass needed to open observable dust gaps using the thermal criterion. We find that this minimum planet mass decreases as a function of time. Particularly, we find that if a planet up to ${\sim}5$ M$_{\oplus}$ in the inner ${\sim}5$ au or up to ${\sim}10-50$ M$_{\oplus}$ at radii ${\gtrsim}5$ au was already formed in the early protostellar phase ($t&lt; 2\times 10^5$ yr) it would barely produce any dust substructures. We conclude that a major contribution to the observed lack of substructures (if produced by planets) in the early protostellar phase - lowering their frequency by ${\sim}50\%$ - could be elevated temperatures rather than the absence of planets.</description>

      <title>A 16 Myr super-Neptune in Upper-Centaurus Lupus and a preliminary survey of transiting planets in Sco-Cen with TESS</title>

Abstract: Measuring the properties of planets younger than about 50 Myr helps to test different planetary formation and evolution models. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed nearly the entire sky, including a wide range of star-forming regions and young stellar clusters, expanding our census of the newborn planet population. In this work, we present the discovery of the TIC 88785435 planetary system located in the Upper-Centaurus Lupus (UCL) region of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) and a preliminary survey of the planet population within Sco-Cen. TIC 88785435 is a pre-main sequence, K7V dwarf ($M_\star = 0.72M_\odot$, $R_\star = 0.91R_\odot$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 3998K, V = 11.7 mag) located within the bounds of UCL. We investigate the distribution of rotation periods measured from the TESS long-cadence data and the Halpha and Li abundances from the spectra of TIC 88785435. TESS long-candence data reveal that TIC 88785435 hosts a transiting super-Neptune ($R_b = 5.03R_\oplus$, P = 10.51 days), TIC 88785435 b. Ground-based follow-up validates the planetary nature of TIC 88785435 b. Using the TESS data, we perform a preliminary survey to investigate how TIC 88785435 b compares to the population of newly born planets located within Sco-Cen.</description>
