      <title>Notes on Deterministic and Stochastic Approaches in Electromagnetic Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the Number of Degrees of Freedom ($N_{\rm DoF}$) of the field in deterministic and stochastic source models within Electromagnetic Information Theory (EIT). Our findings demonstrate a fundamental connection between these two approaches. Specifically, we show that a deterministic model and a stochastic model with a spatially incoherent and homogeneous source yield not only the same $N_{\rm DoF}$ but also identical eigenvalues and basis functions for field representation. This key equivalence not only explains the effectiveness of deterministic approaches in EIT but also corroborates the use of classical electromagnetic methods within this new discipline.</description>

      <title>A Practical Approach to the Design of an S-Band Image-Rejecting Dual-Conversion Super-Heterodyne RF Chain of a Receiver Considering Spur Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a typical design of the RF section of a radar receiver, the chain within a superheterodyne dual-conversion architecture. A significant challenge in this framework is the occurrence of spur signals, which negatively impact the dynamic range of the RF chain. When addressing this issue, the paper introduces an innovative approach to mitigate (or even wipe out) these undesired effects, utilizing two mutually verifying MATLAB codes. These codes have been tested with two distinct commercial mixers and could be applied to any superheterodyne configuration with various mixers. The presented method makes the Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) of the chain the least different from the dynamic range of the chain. Also, the selection of other components gets optimized to align with spurious signals consideration, with explanations provided for these choices. Moreover, two filters of the RF chain, the second and the third, have been designed to reduce implementation costs. Various Microwave software and full-wave analyses were employed for detailed design and analysis, with the results compared to evaluate their performance.</description>

      <title>Dual Orthogonal Projections-Based Multiuser Interference Cancellation for mmWave Beamforming in XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates multiuser interference (MUI) cancellation for millimeter-wave (mmWave) beamforming in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communication systems. We propose a linear algorithm, termed iterative dual orthogonal projections (DOP), which alternates between two orthogonal projections: one to eliminate MUI and the other to refine combiners, ensuring a monotonic increase in spectral efficiency. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that, with each iteration, the signal power for each user increases monotonically, the equivalent noise power after receive combining decreases monotonically, and the spectral efficiency improves accordingly and converges rapidly, closely approaching the theoretical optimum determined by dirty paper coding (DPC), outperforming existing linear algorithms in spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spatially Correlated Blockage Aware Placement of RIS in IIoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of deploying reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in mitigating coverage gaps and enhancing transmission reliability in an industrial internet of things (IIoT) network. First, we consider a single blockage scenario and characterize the correlation between blocking events of the base station (BS)-user and the RIS-user links and study its impact on the probability of establishing a viable reflected link. Then, by considering multiple blockages, we derive the distribution of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) as a function of data size, blockage density, the number of RISs, and the deployment area. We analyze the impact of normalized blockage radius and identify the threshold beyond which the assumption of independent blockages deviates from the ground truth of correlated blocking. Finally, we compare the outage performance of this RIS-assisted system with that operated with network- controlled relays, and demonstrate that while the relays provide a higher reliability beyond a certain blockage threshold, increasing the number of RISs may help mitigate this effect. These insights offer valuable design guidelines for deploying RIS-aided IIoT networks in dense blockage environments.</description>

      <title>Radio Frequency Identification: Decades at a Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we briefly review the history of the use of radio signals to identify objects, and of the key Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) standards for ultra-high-frequency (UHF) and near-field communications that enabled broad use of these technologies in daily life. We will compare the vision for the future presented by the Auto-ID Lab in the early 21st century with the reality we see today, two decades and a little after. We will review some of the applications in which UHF RFID technology has become hugely successful, others where High Frequency Near-field Communications (HF NFC) is preferred, and applications where optical identification or active wireless communications are dominant.
  We will then examine some possible future paths for RFID technology. We anticipate that UHF read capability will become widely available for cellphones, making it as universal as NFC and Bluetooth are today. We will look at more sophisticated radio interfaces, such as multiple-antenna phased arrays for readers, and tunnel diode reflection for tags. We will discuss the integration of information from Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based image processing, barcodes, NFC and UHF tags, into a digital twin of the real environment experienced by the human user. We will examine the role of RFID with sensing in improving the management of perishable goods. The role that RFID might play in a truly circular economy, with intelligent recycling and reuse, will be discussed. Finally, we survey the many hazards and obstacles that obstruct the path to an RF-informed future.</description>

      <title>Graphon Signal Processing for Spiking and Biological Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Signal Processing (GSP) extends classical signal processing to signals defined on graphs, enabling filtering, spectral analysis, and sampling of data generated by networks of various kinds. Graphon Signal Processing (GnSP) develops this framework further by employing the theory of graphons. Graphons are measurable functions on the unit square that represent graphs and limits of convergent graph sequences. The use of graphons provides stability of GSP methods to stochastic variability in network data and improves computational efficiency for very large networks. We use GnSP to address the stimulus identification problem (SIP) in computational and biological neural networks. The SIP is an inverse problem that aims to infer the unknown stimulus s from the observed network output f. We first validate the approach in spiking neural network simulations and then analyze calcium imaging recordings. Graphon-based spectral projections yield trial-invariant, lowdimensional embeddings that improve stimulus classification over Principal Component Analysis and discrete GSP baselines. The embeddings remain stable under variations in network stochasticity, providing robustness to different network sizes and noise levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of GnSP to biological neural networks, opening new avenues for graphon-based analysis in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Toward Multi-Functional LAWNs with ISAC: Opportunities, Challenges, and the Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned as a foundational technology for future low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), enabling real-time environmental perception and data exchange across aerial-ground systems. In this article, we first explore the roles of ISAC in LAWNs from both node-level and network-level perspectives. We highlight the performance gains achieved through hierarchical integration and cooperation, wherein key design trade-offs are demonstrated. Apart from physical-layer enhancements, emerging LAWN applications demand broader functionalities. To this end, we propose a multi-functional LAWN framework that extends ISAC with capabilities in control, computation, wireless power transfer, and large language model (LLM)-based intelligence. We further provide a representative case study to present the benefits of ISAC-enabled LAWNs and the promising research directions are finally outlined.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Integrated Imaging and Communication in Distributed MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a general framework for wireless imaging in distributed MIMO wideband communication systems, considering multi-view non-isotropic targets and near-field propagation effects. For indoor scenarios where the objective is to image small-scale objects with high resolution, we propose a range migration algorithm (RMA)-based scheme using three kinds of array architectures: the full array, boundary array, and distributed boundary array. With non-isotropic near-field channels, we establish the Fourier transformation (FT)-based relationship between the imaging reflectivity and the distributed spatial-domain signals and discuss the corresponding theoretical properties. Next, for outdoor scenarios where the objective is to reconstruct the large-scale three-dimensional (3D) environment with coarse resolution, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based algorithm to solve the multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem, which further addresses the non-isotropic reflectivity across different subcarriers. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in acquiring high-resolution small objects and accurately reconstructing large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>Steerable Invariant Beamformer Using a Differential Line Array of Omnidirectional and Directional Microphones with Null Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line differential microphone arrays have attracted attention for their ability to achieve frequency-invariant beampatterns and high directivity. Recently, the Jacobi-Anger expansion-based approach has enabled the design of fully steerable-invariant differential beamformers for line arrays combining omnidirectional and directional microphones. However, this approach relies on the analytical expression of the ideal beam pattern and the proper selection of truncation order, which is not always practical. This paper introduces a null-constraint-based method for designing frequency- and steerable-invariant differential beamformers using a line array of omnidirectional and directional microphones. The approach employs a multi-constraint optimisation framework, where the reference filter and ideal beam pattern are first determined based on specified nulls and desired direction. Subsequently, the white noise gain constraint is derived from the reference filter, and the beampattern constraint is from the ideal beam pattern. The optimal filter is then obtained by considering constraints related to the beampattern, nulls, and white noise gain. This method achieves a balance between white noise gain and mean square error, allowing robust, frequency- and steerableinvariant differential beamforming performance. It addresses limitations in beam pattern flexibility and truncation errors, offering greater design freedom and improved practical applicability. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms the Jacobi-Anger expansion-based approach in three key aspects: an extended effective range, improved main lobe and null alignment, and greater flexibility in microphone array configuration and beam pattern design, requiring only steering direction and nulls instead of an analytic beam pattern expression.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Radio and Vision Fusion for Robust Localization in Urban V2I Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization is critical for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication systems, especially in urban areas where GPS signals are often obstructed by tall buildings, leading to significant positioning errors, necessitating alternative or complementary techniques for reliable and precise positioning in applications like autonomous driving and smart city infrastructure. This paper proposes a multimodal contrastive learning regression based localization framework for V2I scenarios that combines channel state information (CSI) with visual information to achieve improved accuracy and reliability. The approach leverages the complementary strengths of wireless and visual data to overcome the limitations of traditional localization methods, offering a robust solution for V2I applications. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSI and vision fusion model significantly outperforms traditional methods and single modal models, achieving superior localization accuracy and precision in complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>Symbol Detection Using an Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-driven sampling is a promising alternative to uniform sampling methods, particularly for systems constrained by power and hardware cost. A notable example of this sampling approach is the integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (IF-TEM), which encodes an analog signal into a sequence of time stamps by generating an event each time the integral of the input signal reaches a fixed threshold. In this paper, we propose a receiver architecture that estimates the sequence of transmitted symbols directly from the encoded time stamps, called time encodings, produced by the IF-TEM sampler on the received signal. We show that waveform reconstruction from time encodings is not necessary for symbol detection. We develop an analytical approximation for the symbol error probability (SEP) of the proposed IF-TEM-based receiver and show that it closely matches the SEP results obtained through Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate that narrowing the 3 dB bandwidth of the transmit pulse shaping filter degrades the proposed IF-TEM receiver's performance, highlighting a trade-off between spectral efficiency and error resilience.</description>

      <title>Blind Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted Millimeter Wave Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the research of RIS-assisted communication systems, channel estimation is a problem of vital importance for further performance optimization. In order to reduce the pilot overhead to the greatest extent, blind channel estimation methods are required, which can estimate the channel and the transmit signals at the same time without transmitting pilot sequence. Different from existing researches in traditional MIMO systems, the RIS-assisted two-hop channel brings new challenges to the blind channel estimation design. Hence, a novel blind channel estimation method based on compressed sensing for RIS-assisted multiuser millimeter wave communication systems is proposed for the first time in this paper. Specifically, for accurately estimating the RIS-assisted two-hop channel without transmitting pilots, we propose a block-wise transmission scheme. Among different blocks of data transmission, RIS elements are reconfigured for better estimating the cascade channel. Inside each block, data for each user are mapped to a codeword for realizing the transmit signal recovery and equivalent channel estimation simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve a considerable accuracy of channel estimation and transmit signal recovery.</description>

      <title>EEG-FM-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for the Systematic Evaluation of EEG Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models are poised to significantly advance brain signal analysis by learning robust representations from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. However, their rapid proliferation has outpaced the development of standardized evaluation benchmarks, which complicates direct model comparisons and hinders systematic scientific progress. This fragmentation fosters scientific inefficiency and obscures genuine architectural advancements. To address this critical gap, we introduce EEG-FM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for the systematic and standardized evaluation of EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets from canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and evaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark prominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive baseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we perform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights into model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive experiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction, multitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a unified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench seeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of more robust and generalizable EEG-FMs. Code is released at https://github.com/xw1216/EEG-FM-Bench.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Lifelong Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with energy harvesting (EH) are expected to play a vital role in intelligent 6G systems, especially in industrial sensing and control, where continuous operation and sustainable energy use are critical. Given limited energy resources, WSNs must operate efficiently to ensure long-term performance. Their deployment, however, is challenged by dynamic environments where EH conditions, network scale, and traffic rates change over time. In this work, we address system dynamics that yield different learning tasks, where decision variables remain fixed but strategies vary, as well as learning domains, where both decision space and strategies evolve. To handle such scenarios, we propose a cross-domain lifelong reinforcement learning (CD-L2RL) framework for energy-efficient WSN design. Our CD-L2RL algorithm leverages prior experience to accelerate adaptation across tasks and domains. Unlike conventional approaches based on Markov decision processes or Lyapunov optimization, which assume relatively stable environments, our solution achieves rapid policy adaptation by reusing knowledge from past tasks and domains to ensure continuous operations. We validate the approach through extensive simulations under diverse conditions. Results show that our method improves adaptation speed by up to 35% over standard reinforcement learning and up to 70% over Lyapunov-based optimization, while also increasing total harvested energy. These findings highlight the strong potential of CD-L2RL for deployment in dynamic 6G WSNs.</description>

      <title>Compressed Learning for Nanosurface Deficiency Recognition Using Angle-resolved Scatterometry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale manufacturing requires high-precision surface inspection to guarantee the quality of the produced nanostructures. For production environments, angle-resolved scatterometry offers a non- invasive and in-line compatible alternative to traditional surface inspection methods, such as scanning electron microscopy. However, angle-resolved scatterometry currently suffers from long data acquisition time. Our study addresses the issue of slow data acquisition by proposing a compressed learning framework for the accurate recognition of nanosurface deficiencies using angle-resolved scatterometry data. The framework uses the particle swarm optimization algorithm with a sampling scheme customized for scattering patterns. This combination allows the identification of optimal sampling points in scatterometry data that maximize the detection accuracy of five different levels of deficiency in ZnO nanosurfaces. The proposed method significantly reduces the amount of sampled data while maintaining a high accuracy in deficiency detection, even in noisy environments. Notably, by sampling only 1% of the data, the method achieves an accuracy of over 86%, which further improves to 94% when the sampling rate is increased to 6%. These results demonstrate a favorable balance between data reduction and classification performance. The obtained results also show that the compressed learning framework effectively identifies critical sampling areas.</description>

      <title>Synchrosqueezed X-Ray Wavelet-Chirplet Transform for Accurate Chirp Rate Estimation and Retrieval of Modes from Multicomponent Signals with Crossover Instantaneous Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the chirplet transform and wavelet-chirplet transform (WCT) have enabled the estimation of instantaneous frequencies (IFs) and chirprates, as well as mode retrieval from multicomponent signals with crossover IF curves. However, chirprate estimation via these approaches remains less accurate than IF estimation, primarily due to the slow decay of the chirplet transform or WCT along the chirprate direction. To address this, the synchrosqueezed chirplet transform (SCT) and multiple SCT methods were proposed, achieving moderate improvements in IF and chirprate estimation accuracy. Nevertheless, a novel approach is still needed to enhance the transform's decay along the chirprate direction.
  This paper introduces an X-ray transform-based wavelet-chirprate transform, termed the X-ray wavelet-chirplet transform (XWCT), which exhibits superior decay along the chirprate direction compared to the WCT. Furthermore, third-order synchrosqueezed variants of the WCT and XWCT are developed to yield sharp time-frequency-chirprate representations of signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the XWCT achieves significantly faster decay along the chirprate axis, while the third-order synchrosqueezed XWCT enables accurate IF and chirprate estimation, as well as mode retrieval, without requiring multiple synchrosqueezing operations.</description>

      <title>A Unified Transformer Architecture for Low-Latency and Scalable Wireless Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified Transformer-based architecture for wireless signal processing tasks, offering a low-latency, task-adaptive alternative to conventional receiver pipelines. Unlike traditional modular designs, our model integrates channel estimation, interpolation, and demapping into a single, compact attention-driven architecture designed for real-time deployment. The model's structure allows dynamic adaptation to diverse output formats by simply modifying the final projection layer, enabling consistent reuse across receiver subsystems. Experimental results demonstrate strong generalization to varying user counts, modulation schemes, and pilot configurations, while satisfying latency constraints imposed by practical systems. The architecture is evaluated across three core use cases: (1) an End-to-End Receiver, which replaces the entire baseband processing pipeline from pilot symbols to bit-level decisions; (2) Channel Frequency Interpolation, implemented and tested within a 3GPP-compliant OAI+Aerial system; and (3) Channel Estimation, where the model infers full-band channel responses from sparse pilot observations. In all cases, our approach outperforms classical baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work presents a deployable, data-driven alternative to hand-engineered PHY-layer blocks, and lays the foundation for intelligent, software-defined signal processing in next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Positioning via Probabilistic Graphical Models in RIS-Aided Systems with Channel Estimation Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a 6D Bayesian-based localization framework to estimate the position and rotation angles of a mobile station (MS) within an indoor reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system. This framework relies on a probabilistic graphical model to represent the joint probability distribution of random variables through their conditional dependencies and employs the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) to approximate the posterior distribution based on the estimated channel parameters. Our framework estimates both the position and rotation of the mobile station (MS), in the presence of channel parameter estimation errors. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the proposed scenario and use it to evaluate the system's position error bound (PEB) and rotation error bound (REB). We compare the system performances with and without RIS. The results demonstrate that the RIS can enhance positioning accuracy significantly.</description>

      <title>Relative Navigation and Dynamic Target Tracking for Autonomous Underwater Proximity Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating a target's 6-DoF motion in underwater proximity operations is difficult because the chaser lacks target-side proprioception and the available relative observations are sparse, noisy, and often partial (e.g., Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) positions). Without a motion prior, factor-graph maximum a posteriori estimation is underconstrained: consecutive target states are weakly linked and orientation can drift. We propose a generalized constant-twist motion prior defined on the tangent space of Lie groups that enforces temporally consistent trajectories across all degrees of freedom; in SE(3) it couples translation and rotation in the body frame. We present a ternary factor and derive its closed-form Jacobians based on standard Lie group operations, enabling drop-in use for trajectories on arbitrary Lie groups. We evaluate two deployment modes: (A) an SE(3)-only representation that regularizes orientation even when only position is measured, and (B) a mode with boundary factors that switches the target representation between SE(3) and 3D position while applying the same generalized constant-twist prior across representation changes. Validation on a real-world dynamic docking scenario dataset shows consistent ego-target trajectory estimation through USBL-only and optical relative measurement segments with an improved relative tracking accuracy compared to the noisy measurements to the target. Because the construction relies on standard Lie group primitives, it is portable across state manifolds and sensing modalities.</description>

      <title>Localization using Angle-of-Arrival Triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization is a long-standing challenge in mobile computing, with significant implications for enabling location-aware and intelligent applications within smart environments such as homes, offices, and retail spaces. As AI assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Nest become increasingly pervasive, microphone-equipped devices are emerging as key components of everyday life and home automation. This paper introduces a passive, infrastructure-light system for localizing human speakers using speech signals captured by two or more spatially distributed smart devices. The proposed approach, GCC+, extends the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) method to estimate the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of audio signals at each device and applies robust triangulation techniques to infer the speaker's two-dimensional position. To further improve temporal resolution and localization accuracy, feature-space expansion and subsample interpolation techniques are employed for precise Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) estimation. The system operates without requiring hardware modifications, prior calibration, explicit user cooperation, or knowledge of the speaker's signal content, thereby offering a highly practical solution for real-world deployment. Experimental evaluation in a real-world home environment yields a median AoA estimation error of 2.2 degrees and a median localization error of 1.25 m, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of audio-based localization for enabling context-aware, privacy-preserving ambient intelligence.</description>

      <title>TSPC-PFD: TSPC-Based Low-Power High-Resolution CMOS Phase Frequency Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase Frequency Detectors (PFDs) are essential components in Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) and Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) systems, responsible for comparing phase and frequency differences and generating up/down signals to regulate charge pumps and/or, consequently, Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCOs). Conventional PFD designs often suffer from significant dead zones and blind zones, which degrade phase detection accuracy and increase jitter in high-speed applications. This paper addresses PFD design challenges and presents a novel low-power True Single-Phase Clock (TSPC)-based PFD. The proposed design eliminates the blind zone entirely while achieving a minimal dead zone of 40 ps. The proposed PFD, implemented using TSMC 28 nm technology, demonstrates a low-power consumption of 4.41 uW at 3 GHz input frequency with a layout area of $10.42\mu m^2$.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Control in RIS-Aided Wireless Communications: A Predictive Physics-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) into wireless communication systems is a promising approach for enhancing coverage and data rates by intelligently redirecting signals, through a process known as beamforming. However, the process of RIS beamforming (or passive beamforming) control is associated with multiple latency-inducing factors. As a result, by the time the beamforming is effectively updated, the channel conditions may have already changed. For example, the low update rate of localization systems becomes a critical limitation, as a mobile UE's position may change significantly between two consecutive measurements. To address this issue, this work proposes a practical and scalable physics-based solution that is effective across a wide range of UE movement models. Specifically, we propose a kinematic observer and predictor to enable proactive RIS control. From low-rate position estimates provided by a localizer, the kinematic observer infers the UE's speed and acceleration. These motion parameters are then used by a predictor to estimate the UE's future positions at a higher rate, allowing the RIS to adjust promptly and compensate for inherent delays in both the RIS control and localization systems. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating real-time RIS adjustments with low computational complexity, even in scenarios involving rapid UE movement.</description>

Abstract: Coded wavefront sensing (Coded-WFS) is a snapshot quantitative phase imaging (QPI) technique that has been shown to successfully leverage the memory effect to retrieve the phase of biological specimens. In this paper, we perform QPI on static silica beads and dynamic HEK cells using Coded-WFS. The accuracy of the retrieved phase map is validated using digital holographic microscopy (DHM) for the same specimens.

      <title>Enhancing Energy and Spectral Efficiency in IoT-Cellular Networks via Active SIM-Equipped LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system enhanced by an active stacked intelligent metasurface (ASIM), mounted on the backplate of the satellite solar panels to efficiently utilize limited onboard space and reduce the main satellite power amplifier requirements. The system serves multiple ground users via rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and IoT devices through a symbiotic radio network. Multi-layer sequential processing in the ASIM improves effective channel gains and suppresses inter-user interference, outperforming active RIS and beyond-diagonal RIS designs. Three optimization approaches are evaluated: block coordinate descent with successive convex approximation (BCD-SCA), model-assisted multi-agent constraint soft actor-critic (MA-CSAC), and multi-constraint proximal policy optimization (MCPPO). Simulation results show that BCD-SCA converges fast and stably in convex scenarios without learning, MCPPO achieves rapid initial convergence with moderate stability, and MA-CSAC attains the highest long-term spectral and energy efficiency in large-scale networks. Energy-spectral efficiency trade-offs are analyzed for different ASIM elements, satellite antennas, and transmit power. Overall, the study demonstrates that integrating multi-layer ASIM with suitable optimization algorithms offers a scalable, energy-efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation LEO satellite communications.</description>

      <title>Random-phase Gaussian Wave Splatting for Computer-generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for virtual and augmented reality systems, but rely on advanced computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns that can be displayed on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS) has recently emerged as a powerful CGH paradigm that allows for the conversion of Gaussians, a state-of-the-art neural 3D representation, into holograms. However, GWS assumes smooth-phase distributions over the Gaussian primitives, limiting their ability to model view-dependent effects and reconstruct accurate defocus blur, and severely under-utilizing the space-bandwidth product of the SLM. In this work, we propose random-phase GWS (GWS-RP) to improve bandwidth utilization, which has the effect of increasing eyebox size, reconstructing accurate defocus blur and parallax, and supporting time-multiplexed rendering to suppress speckle artifacts.
  At the core of GWS-RP are (1) a fundamentally new wavefront compositing procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme specifically designed for random-phase Gaussian primitives, ensuring physically correct color reconstruction and robust occlusion handling. Additionally, we present the first formally derived algorithm for applying random phase to Gaussian primitives, grounded in rigorous statistical optics analysis and validated through practical near-eye display applications. Through extensive simulations and experimental validations, we demonstrate that these advancements, collectively with time-multiplexing, uniquely enables full-bandwith light field CGH that supports accurate accurate parallax and defocus, yielding state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for next-generation near-eye displays.</description>

      <title>In-Memory Computing Enabled Deep MIMO Detection to Support Ultra-Low-Latency Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks imposes unprecedented latency and reliability demands on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a key enabler of high-speed radio access. Recently, deep unfolding-based detectors, which map iterative algorithms onto neural network architectures, have emerged as a promising approach, combining the strengths of model-driven and data-driven methods to achieve high detection accuracy with relatively low complexity. However, algorithmic innovation alone is insufficient; software-hardware co-design is essential to meet the extreme latency requirements of 6G (i.e., 0.1 milliseconds). This motivates us to propose leveraging in-memory computing, which is an analog computing technology that integrates memory and computation within memristor circuits, to perform the intensive matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations inherent in deep MIMO detection at the nanosecond scale. Specifically, we introduce a novel architecture, called the deep in-memory MIMO (IM-MIMO) detector, characterized by two key features. First, each of its cascaded computational blocks is decomposed into channel-dependent and channel-independent neural network modules. Such a design minimizes the latency of memristor reprogramming in response to channel variations, which significantly exceeds computation time. Second, we develop a customized detector-training method that exploits prior knowledge of memristor-value statistics to enhance robustness against programming noise. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the IM-MIMO detector's performance, evaluating detection accuracy, processing latency, and hardware complexity. Our study quantifies detection error as a function of various factors, including channel noise, memristor programming noise, and neural network size.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Change Point Detection on Manifolds with Robust Centroid Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function (robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the beamforming optimization for sensing a point-like scatterer using a bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar, which could be part of a joint communication and sensing system. The goal is to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound on the target position's estimation error, where the radar already knows an approximate position that is taken into account in the optimization. The optimization considers multiple subcarriers, and permits beamforming with more than one beam per subcarrier. We discuss the properties of optimal beamforming solutions, including the case of a known channel gain. Numerical results show that beamforming with at most one beam per subcarrier is optimal for certain parameters, but for other parameters, optimal solutions need two beams on some subcarriers. In addition, the degree of freedom which end of the bistatic radar should transmit and receive in a bidirectional radar is considered.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Edge-State Tracking for Resilient Affine Formation Control</title>

Abstract: Affine formation control (AFC) is a subset of formation control methods that enables coordinated multiagent movement while preserving affine relationships, and has recently gained increasing popularity due to its broad applicability across diverse applications. AFC is inherently distributed, where each agent's local controller relies on the relative displacements of neighboring agents. The unavailability of these measurements in practice, due to node or communication failures, leads to a change in the underlying graph topology and subsequently causes instability or sub-optimal performance. In this work, each edge in the graph is modeled using a state-space framework, allowing the corresponding edge-states to be estimated with or without up-to-date measurements. We then propose a Kalman-based estimation framework where we fuse both temporal information from agents' dynamics and spatial information, which is derived from the geometry of the affine formations. We give convergence guarantees and optimality analysis on the proposed algorithm, and numerical validations show the enhanced resilience of AFC against these topology changes in several practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Likelihood Estimation Based on Diffusion Model For Wireless Communications</title>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, with their powerful feature learning capabilities, have been applied in many fields. In mobile wireless communications, GenAI can dynamically optimize the network to enhance the user experience. Especially in signal detection and channel estimation tasks, due to digital signals following a certain random distribution, GenAI models can fully utilize their distribution learning characteristics. For example, diffusion models (DMs) and normalized flow models have been applied to related tasks. However, since the DM cannot guarantee that the generated results are the maximum-likelihood estimation points of the distribution during the data generation process, the successful task completion rate is reduced. Based on this, this paper proposes a Maximum-Likelihood Estimation Inference (MLEI) framework. The framework uses the loss function in the forward diffusion process of the DM to infer the maximum-likelihood estimation points in the discrete space. Then, we present a signal detection task in near-field communication scenarios with unknown noise characteristics. In experiments, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework has better performance than state-of-the-art signal estimators.</description>

      <title>Sliding DFT-based Signal Recovery for Modulo ADC with 1-bit Folding Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modulo analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a promising solution to resolve the limited dynamic range (DR) issue of conventional ADCs and achieve an enhanced digital resolution given a fixed quantization bit budget. However, a modulo ADC requires an unfolding scheme to correct the nonlinear distortion introduced by the modulo operation. This paper presents a sliding discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based method for fast signal reconstruction given the modulo ADC output sequence and a 1-bit folding information sequence. In contrast to existing DFT-based signal recovery techniques for modulo ADCs, our proposed sliding DFT method reduces the required observation time and minimizes the spectral leakage effects via proper choice of window function parameters. A mean squared error (MSE) performance guarantee is established for the proposed signal recovery algorithm. More precisely, we derive sufficient conditions for the oversampling factor ($\mathrm{OF}$) and the number of quantization bits ($b$) to obtain a specific MSE performance. Our numerical results demonstrate that modulo ADCs equipped with our proposed recovery method can outperform conventional ADCs without modulo for $\mathrm{OF} \geq 4$ and $b \geq 4$. Moreover, the proposed sliding DFT-based recovery method outperforms higher-order difference-based recovery in terms of MSE, particularly in the low-sampling-rate and low-resolution regime. The impact of spectral leakage on the MSE performance of the proposed sliding DFT recovery method is also quantified.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air DPD and Reciprocity Calibration in Massive MIMO and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-linear transceivers and non-reciprocity of downlink and uplink channels are two major challenges in the deployment of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We consider an over-the-air (OTA) approach for digital pre-distortion (DPD) and reciprocity calibration to jointly address these issues. In particular, we consider a memory-less non-linearity model for the base station (BS) transmitters, and we propose a method to perform both linearization and reciprocity calibration based on mutual coupling OTA measurements between BS antennas. We show that, by using only the OTA-based data, we can linearize the transmitters and design the calibration to compensate for both the non-linearity and non-reciprocity of BS transceivers. This allows alleviating the requirement to have dedicated hardware modules for transceiver linearization. Moreover, the proposed reciprocity calibration method is solely based on closed-form linear transformations, achieving a significant complexity reduction over state-of-the-art reciprocity methods, which assume linear transceivers, and rely on iterative methods. Simulation results showcase the potential of our approach in terms of the calibration matrix estimation error and downlink data-rates when applying zero-forcing (ZF) precoding after using our OTA-based DPD and reciprocity calibration method.</description>

      <title>A Wearable Strain-Sensor-Based Shoulder Patch for Fatigue Detection in Bicep Curls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common challenge in home-based rehabilitation is muscle compensation induced by pain or fatigue, where patients with weakened primary muscles recruit secondary muscle groups to assist their movement, causing issues such as delayed rehabilitation progress or risk of further injury. In a home-based setting, the subtle compensatory actions may not be perceived since physiotherapists cannot directly observe patients. To address this problem, this study develops a novel wearable strain sensor-based shoulder patch to detect fatigue-induced muscle compensation during bicep curl exercises. Built on an observation that the amplitude of a strain sensor's resistance is correlated to the motion of a joint that the sensor is attached to, we develop an algorithm that can robustly detect the state when significant changes appear in the shoulder joint motion, which indicates fatigue-induced muscle compensation in bicep curls. The developed shoulder patch is tested on 13 subjects who perform bicep curl exercises with a 5 kg dumbbell until reaching fatigue. During the experiment, the performance of the shoulder patch is also benchmarked with optical tracking sensors and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors. Results reveal that the proposed wearable sensor and detection methods effectively monitor fatigue-induced muscle compensation during bicep curl exercises in both Real-Time and Post Hoc modes. This development marks a significant step toward enhancing the effectiveness of home-based rehabilitation by providing physiotherapists with a tool to monitor and adjust treatment plans remotely.</description>

      <title>Data-Importance-Aware Power Allocation for Adaptive Semantic Communication in Computer Vision Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Life-transformative applications such as immersive extended reality are revolutionizing wireless communications and computer vision (CV). This paper presents a novel framework for importance-aware adaptive data transmissions, designed specifically for real-time CV applications where task-specific fidelity is critical. A novel importance-weighted mean square error (IMSE) metric is introduced as a task-oriented measure of reconstruction quality, considering sub-pixel-level importance (SP-I) and semantic segment-level importance (SS-I) models. To minimize IMSE under total power constraints, data-importance-aware waterfilling approaches are proposed to optimally allocate transmission power according to data importance and channel conditions, prioritizing sub-streams with high importance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform margin-adaptive waterfilling and equal power allocation strategies. The data partitioning that combines both SP-I and SS-I models is shown to achieve the most significant improvements, with normalized IMSE gains exceeding $7\,$dB and $10\,$dB over the baselines at high SNRs ($&gt;10\,$dB). These substantial gains highlight the potential of the proposed framework to enhance data efficiency and robustness in real-time CV applications, especially in bandwidth-limited and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal IoT Node for Energy-Efficient Environmental Monitoring with Edge AI Processing</title>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has significantly advanced environmental monitoring (EM) by enabling cost-effective and scalable sensing solutions. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are introducing powerful tools for the efficient and accurate analysis of complex environmental data. However, current IoT platforms for environmental sensing are typically limited to a narrow set of sensors, preventing a comprehensive assessment of environmental conditions and lacking sufficient computational capabilities to support the deployment of advanced ML and AI algorithms on the edge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a compact (17x38 mm2), multi-modal, MCU-based environmental IoT node integrating 11 sensors, including CO2 concentration, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), light intensity, UV radiation, pressure, temperature, humidity, visual sensing via an RGB camera, and precise geolocation through a GNSS module. It features GAP9, a parallel ultra-low-power system-on-chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient edge processing of advanced ML models directly on-device. We implemented a YOLOv5-based occupancy detection pipeline (0.3 M parameters, 42 MOP per inference), demonstrating 42% energy savings over raw data streaming. Additionally, we present a smart indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring setup that combines occupancy detection with adaptive sample rates, achieving operational times of up to 143 h on a single compact 600 mAh, 3.7 V battery. Our platform lays the groundwork for innovative applications such as predictive indoor IAQ, enabling efficient AI-driven on-edge forecasting for energy-efficient and autonomous, proactive pollution-mitigation control strategies</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization for Movable Antenna-aided Cell-Free ISAC with Time Synchronization Errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) system, which effectively mitigates intra-cell interference and provides precise sensing accuracy, is a promising technology for future 6G networks. However, to fully capitalize on the potential of CF-ISAC, accurate time synchronization (TS) between access points (APs) is critical. Due to the limitations of current synchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in the development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel CF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial diversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce the impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the worst-case Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Subsequently, we develop a joint optimization framework for AP beamforming and MA positions to satisfy communication rate constraints while improving sensing accuracy. A robust optimization framework is designed for the highly complex and non-convex problem. Specifically, we employ manifold optimization (MO) to solve the worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem. Then, we propose an MA-enabled meta-reinforcement learning (MA-MetaRL) to design optimization variables while satisfying constraints on MA positions, communication rate, and transmit power, thereby improving sensing accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust optimization algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of the detection and is strong against TS errors. Moreover, compared to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) technologies, the proposed MA-aided CF-ISAC architecture achieves higher system capacity, thus validating its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) architecture is a promising enabler for 6G, offering spectrum efficiency and ubiquitous coverage. However, real deployments suffer from hardware impairments, especially nonlinear distortion from power amplifiers (PAs), which degrades both communication and sensing. To address this, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-aided CF-ISAC system that mitigates distortion and enhances robustness. The PAs nonlinearities are modeled by a third-order memoryless polynomial, where the third-order distortion coefficients (3RDCs) vary across access points (APs) due to hardware differences, aging, and environmental conditions. We design a distributed distortion-aware worst-case robust optimization framework that explicitly incorporates uncertainty in 3RDCs. First, we analyze the worst-case impact of PA distortion on both the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and communication rate. Then, to address the resulting non-convexity, we apply successive convex approximation (SCA) for estimating the 3RDCs. With these, we jointly optimize beamforming and MA positions under transmit power and sensing constraints. To efficiently solve this highly non-convex problem, we develop an MA-enabled self-attention convolutional graph neural network (SACGNN) algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the communication-sensing trade-off under distortion and outperforms fixed-position antenna baselines in terms of robustness and capacity, thereby highlighting the advantages of MA-aided CF-ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Particle Filtering for RSS-Based Target Localization under Varying Noise Levels and Sensor Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target localization is a critical task in various applications, such as search and rescue, surveillance, and wireless sensor networks. When a target emits a radio frequency (RF) signal, spatially distributed sensors can collect signal measurements to estimate the target's location. Among various measurement modalities, received signal strength (RSS) is particularly attractive due to its low cost, low power consumption, and ease of deployment. While particle filtering has previously been applied to RSS-based target localization, few studies have systematically analyzed its performance under varying sensor geometries and RSS noise levels. This paper addresses this gap by designing and evaluating a particle filtering algorithm for localizing a stationary target. The proposed method is compared with a conventional RSS-based trilateration approach across different sensor configurations and noise conditions. Simulation results indicate that particle filtering provides more accurate target localization than trilateration, particularly in scenarios with unfavorable sensor geometries and high RSS noise.</description>

      <title>Negative Spin $\Delta_T$ noise Induced by Spin-Flip Scattering and Andreev Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14072v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study charge $\Delta_T$ noise, followed by an examination of spin $\Delta_T$ noise, in the normal metal-spin flipper-normal metal-insulator-superconductor (N-sf-N-I-S) junction. Our analysis reveals a key contrast: while charge $\Delta_T$ noise remains strictly positive, spin $\Delta_T$ noise undergoes a sign reversal from positive to negative, driven by the interplay between spin-flip scattering as well as Andreev reflection. In contrast, charge quantum shot noise remains positive and sign-definite, which is valid for spin quantum shot noise also. The emergence of negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise has two major implications. First, it establishes a clear distinction between spin resolved $\Delta_T$ noise and quantum shot noise: the former is dominated by opposite-spin correlations, whereas the latter is led by same-spin correlations. Second, it provides access to scattering mechanisms that are not captured by quantum shot noise alone. Thus, negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise serves as a unique probe of the cooperative effects of Andreev reflection and spin flipping. We further place our results in context by comparing them with earlier reports of negative $\Delta_T$ noise in strongly correlated systems, such as fractional quantum Hall states, and in multiterminal hybrid superconducting junctions. Overall, this work offers new insights into the mechanisms governing sign reversals in $\Delta_T$ noise and highlights their role as distinctive fingerprints of spin-dependent scattering in superconducting hybrid devices.</description>

Abstract: Condition monitoring is essential for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of modern industrial systems. With the increasing complexity of industrial processes, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for fault detection and diagnosis, attracting growing interest from both academia and industry. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of intelligent condition monitoring methods, with a particular emphasis on chemical plants and the widely used Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) benchmark. State-of-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are reviewed, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability to industrial fault detection and diagnosis. Special attention is given to key challenges, including imbalanced and unlabeled data, and to strategies by which models can address these issues. Furthermore, comparative analyses of algorithm performance are presented to guide method selection in practical scenarios. This survey is intended to benefit both newcomers and experienced researchers by consolidating fundamental concepts, summarizing recent advances, and outlining open challenges and promising directions for intelligent condition monitoring in industrial plants.</description>

      <title>Soundscape Captioning using Sound Affective Quality Network and Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We live in a rich and varied acoustic world, which is experienced by individuals or communities as a soundscape. Computational auditory scene analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events, focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal characteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the affective soundscape captioning (ASSC) task, which enables automated soundscape analysis, thus avoiding labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in conventional methods. With soundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions are generated for soundscape by capturing the acoustic scenes (ASs), audio events (AEs) information, and the corresponding human affective qualities (AQs). To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) system composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet, and a large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about ASs, AEs, and perceived AQs, while the LLM describes the soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with SoundAQnet. SoundSCaper is assessed by two juries of 32 people. In expert evaluation, the average score of SoundSCaper-generated captions is slightly lower than that of two soundscape experts on the evaluation set D1 and the external mixed dataset D2, but not statistically significant. In layperson evaluation, SoundSCaper outperforms soundscape experts in several metrics. In addition to human evaluation, compared to other automated audio captioning systems with and without LLM, SoundSCaper performs better on the ASSC task in several NLP-based metrics. Overall, SoundSCaper performs well in human subjective evaluation and various objective captioning metrics, and the generated captions are comparable to those annotated by soundscape experts.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Microwave Polarization Switching Antenna for Covert Communication Implemented With Directed Surface Acoustic Waves in an Artificial Multiferroic Magnonic Crystal</title>

Abstract: Polarization switches are of great technological interest because of their many applications in long distance electromagnetic communication (e.g., polarization division multiplexing). Binary bits can be encoded in the two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave that they transmit. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically &gt; 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension, ~5 nm thickness) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial multiferroic magnonic crystal (AMMC)" is reported. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites confined spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, which then radiate electromagnetic waves in space via magnon-photon coupling. In some particular direction(s), determined by the AMMC parameters, the polarization of the beam at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by switching the direction of SAW propagation in the piezoelectric substrate between two mutually orthogonal directions via activation of two different pairs of SAW launching electrodes. By aligning the transmitter and the receiver along such a direction (known only to authorized users), one can communicate covertly from point to point, without the need for encryption or cryptography.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pain Recognition via Respiration Signals: A Single Cross-Attention Transformer Multi-Window Fusion Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21886</link>

Abstract: Pain is a complex condition that affects a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain and supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring, aid clinical decision-making, and aim to reduce distress while preventing functional decline. This study has been submitted to the Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN). The proposed method introduces a pipeline that employs respiration as the input signal and integrates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer with a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration serves as a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Furthermore, results show that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can deliver strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window strategy effectively captures short-term and long-term features, along with global characteristics, enhancing the model's representational capacity.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Model Enabled Semantic Communication Based on Robust Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented Photon-Trapping Spectrometer-on-a-Chip on Silicon Platform with Extended Near-Infrared Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a compact, noise-resilient reconstructive spectrometer-on-a-chip that achieves high-resolution hyperspectral imaging across an extended near-infrared (NIR) range up to 1100nm. The device integrates monolithically fabricated silicon photodiodes enhanced with photon-trapping surface textures (PTST), enabling improved responsivity in the low-absorption NIR regime. Leveraging a fully connected neural network, we demonstrate accurate spectral reconstruction from only 16 uniquely engineered detectors, achieving &lt;0.05 RMSE and 8nm resolution over a wide spectral range of 640nm to 1100nm. Our system outperforms conventional spectrometers, maintaining signal-to-noise ratio above 30dB even with 40dB of added detector noise; extending functionality to longer wavelengths up to 1100nm, while the traditional spectrometers fail to perform beyond 950nm due to poor detector efficiency and noise performance. With a footprint of 0.4mm2, dynamic range of 50dB, ultrafast time response (57ps), and high photodiode gain (&gt;7000), this AI-augmented silicon spectrometer is well-suited for portable, real-time, and low-light applications in biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing. The results establish a pathway toward fully integrated, high-performance hyperspectral sensing in a CMOS-compatible platform.</description>
