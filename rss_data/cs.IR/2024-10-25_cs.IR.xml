      <title>CUPID: A Real-Time Session-Based Reciprocal Recommendation System for a One-on-One Social Discovery Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces CUPID, a novel approach to session-based reciprocal recommendation systems designed for a real-time one-on-one social discovery platform. In such platforms, low latency is critical to enhance user experiences. However, conventional session-based approaches struggle with high latency due to the demands of modeling sequential user behavior for each recommendation process. Additionally, given the reciprocal nature of the platform, where users act as items for each other, training recommendation models on large-scale datasets is computationally prohibitive using conventional methods. To address these challenges, CUPID decouples the time-intensive user session modeling from the real-time user matching process to reduce inference time. Furthermore, CUPID employs a two-phase training strategy that separates the training of embedding and prediction layers, significantly reducing the computational burden by decreasing the number of sequential model inferences by several hundredfold. Extensive experiments on large-scale Azar datasets demonstrate CUPID's effectiveness in a real-world production environment. Notably, CUPID reduces response latency by more than 76% compared to non-asynchronous systems, while significantly improving user engagement.</description>

      <title>Liver Cancer Knowledge Graph Construction based on dynamic entity replacement and masking strategies RoBERTa-BiLSTM-CRF model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Liver cancer ranks as the fifth most common malignant tumor and the second most fatal in our country. Early diagnosis is crucial, necessitating that physicians identify liver cancer in patients at the earliest possible stage. However, the diagnostic process is complex and demanding. Physicians must analyze a broad spectrum of patient data, encompassing physical condition, symptoms, medical history, and results from various examinations and tests, recorded in both structured and unstructured medical formats. This results in a significant workload for healthcare professionals. In response, integrating knowledge graph technology to develop a liver cancer knowledge graph-assisted diagnosis and treatment system aligns with national efforts toward smart healthcare. Such a system promises to mitigate the challenges faced by physicians in diagnosing and treating liver cancer.
  Methods: This paper addresses the major challenges in building a knowledge graph for hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis, such as the discrepancy between public data sources and real electronic medical records, the effective integration of which remains a key issue. The knowledge graph construction process consists of six steps: conceptual layer design, data preprocessing, entity identification, entity normalization, knowledge fusion, and graph visualization. A novel Dynamic Entity Replacement and Masking Strategy (DERM) for named entity recognition is proposed.
  Results: A knowledge graph for liver cancer was established, including 7 entity types such as disease, symptom, and constitution, containing 1495 entities. The recognition accuracy of the model was 93.23%, the recall was 94.69%, and the F1 score was 93.96%.</description>

      <title>$M^3EL$: A Multi-task Multi-topic Dataset for Multi-modal Entity Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal Entity Linking (MEL) is a fundamental component for various downstream tasks. However, existing MEL datasets suffer from small scale, scarcity of topic types and limited coverage of tasks, making them incapable of effectively enhancing the entity linking capabilities of multi-modal models. To address these obstacles, we propose a dataset construction pipeline and publish $M^3EL$, a large-scale dataset for MEL. $M^3EL$ includes 79,625 instances, covering 9 diverse multi-modal tasks, and 5 different topics. In addition, to further improve the model's adaptability to multi-modal tasks, We propose a modality-augmented training strategy. Utilizing $M^3EL$ as a corpus, train the $\textit{CLIP}_{\textit{ND}}$ model based on $\textit{CLIP} (\textit{ViT}-\textit{B}-\textit{32})$, and conduct a comparative analysis with an existing multi-modal baselines. Experimental results show that the existing models perform far below expectations (ACC of 49.4%-75.8%), After analysis, it was obtained that small dataset sizes, insufficient modality task coverage, and limited topic diversity resulted in poor generalisation of multi-modal models. Our dataset effectively addresses these issues, and the $\textit{CLIP}_{\textit{ND}}$ model fine-tuned with $M^3EL$ shows a significant improvement in accuracy, with an average improvement of 9.3% to 25% across various tasks. Our dataset is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/M3EL.</description>

      <title>RRADistill: Distilling LLMs' Passage Ranking Ability for Document Re-Ranking of Long-Tail Queries in a Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding the semantic relationships between queries and documents, even with lengthy and complex long-tail queries. These queries are challenging for feedback-based rankings due to sparse user engagement and limited feedback, making LLMs' ranking ability highly valuable. However, the large size and slow inference of LLMs necessitate the development of smaller, more efficient models (sLLMs). Recently, integrating ranking label generation into distillation techniques has become crucial, but existing methods underutilize LLMs' capabilities and are cumbersome. Our research, RRADistill: Re-Ranking Ability Distillation, propose an efficient label generation pipeline and novel sLLM training methods for both encoder and decoder models. We introduce an encoder-based method using a Term Control Layer to capture term matching signals and a decoder-based model with a ranking layer for enhanced understanding. A/B testing on a Korean-based search platform, validates the effectiveness of our approach in improving re-ranking for long-tail queries.</description>

      <title>Improving Embedding Accuracy for Document Retrieval Using Entity Relationship Maps and Model-Aware Contrastive Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present APEX-Embedding-7B (Advanced Processing for Epistemic eXtraction), a 7-billion parameter decoder-only text Feature Extraction Model, specifically designed for Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks. Our approach employs two training techniques that yield an emergent improvement in factual focus: (1) Pre-convergence interrupted fine-tuning using Structured Entity Relationship Maps as training data input: designed to shift the model's attention and create a bias towards factual content rather than semantic style - this enhances plain text performance despite not being directly trained for it; and (2) Model-Aware Contrastive Sampling, creating a balanced and evenly distributed collation map of hard and soft negatives directly informed by the base model's competency. This combined methodology yields significant improvements, enhancing plain text query/document pair retrieval to achieve an absolute rank@1 accuracy of 90.86% (an increase of 6.26% compared to the next leading model) in our evaluation, and reducing training data input context size by an average of 37.71% compared to plain text for both queries and document texts. Based on our evaluations, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art standard in text feature extraction for longer context document retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Data Efficiency for Large Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large recommendation models (LRMs) are fundamental to the multi-billion dollar online advertising industry, processing massive datasets of hundreds of billions of examples before transitioning to continuous online training to adapt to rapidly changing user behavior. The massive scale of data directly impacts both computational costs and the speed at which new methods can be evaluated (R&amp;D velocity).
  This paper presents actionable principles and high-level frameworks to guide practitioners in optimizing training data requirements. These strategies have been successfully deployed in Google's largest Ads CTR prediction models and are broadly applicable beyond LRMs. We outline the concept of data convergence, describe methods to accelerate this convergence, and finally, detail how to optimally balance training data volume with model size.</description>

      <title>Yesterday's News: Benchmarking Multi-Dimensional Out-of-Distribution Generalisation of Misinformation Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces misinfo-general, a benchmark dataset for evaluating misinformation models' ability to perform out-of-distribution generalisation. Misinformation changes rapidly, much quicker than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation models need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalisation, an understudied problem in existing datasets. We identify 6 axes of generalisation-time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type-and design evaluation procedures for each. We also analyse some baseline models, highlighting how these fail important desiderata.</description>

      <title>Tethering Broken Themes: Aligning Neural Topic Models with Labels and Authors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic models are a popular approach for extracting semantic information from large document collections. However, recent studies suggest that the topics generated by these models often do not align well with human intentions. While metadata such as labels and authorship information is available, it has not yet been effectively incorporated into neural topic models. To address this gap, we introduce FANToM, a novel method for aligning neural topic models with both labels and authorship information. FANToM allows for the inclusion of this metadata when available, producing interpretable topics and author distributions for each topic. Our approach demonstrates greater expressiveness than conventional topic models by learning the alignment between labels, topics, and authors. Experimental results show that FANToM improves upon existing models in terms of both topic quality and alignment. Additionally, it identifies author interests and similarities.</description>

      <title>SmartRAG: Jointly Learn RAG-Related Tasks From the Environment Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAG systems consist of multiple modules to work together. However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</description>

      <title>NexusIndex: Integrating Advanced Vector Indexing and Multi-Model Embeddings for Robust Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of fake news on digital platforms has underscored the need for robust and scalable detection mechanisms. Traditional methods often fall short in handling large and diverse datasets due to limitations in scalability and accuracy. In this paper, we propose NexusIndex, a novel framework and model that enhances fake news detection by integrating advanced language models, an innovative FAISSNexusIndex layer, and attention mechanisms. Our approach leverages multi-model embeddings to capture rich contextual and semantic nuances, significantly improving text interpretation and classification accuracy. By transforming articles into high-dimensional embeddings and indexing them efficiently, NexusIndex facilitates rapid similarity searches across extensive collections of news articles. The FAISSNexusIndex layer further optimizes this process, enabling real-time detection and enhancing the system's scalability and performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that NexusIndex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and accuracy across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>Probing Ranking LLMs: Mechanistic Interpretability in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer networks, especially those with performance on par with GPT models, are renowned for their powerful feature extraction capabilities. However, the nature and correlation of these features with human-engineered ones remain unclear. In this study, we delve into the mechanistic workings of state-of-the-art, fine-tuning-based passage-reranking transformer networks.
  Our approach involves a probing-based, layer-by-layer analysis of neurons within ranking LLMs to identify individual or groups of known human-engineered and semantic features within the network's activations. We explore a wide range of features, including lexical, document structure, query-document interaction, advanced semantic, interaction-based, and LLM-specific features, to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive ranking decisions in LLMs.
  Our results reveal a set of features that are prominently represented in LLM activations, as well as others that are notably absent. Additionally, we observe distinct behaviors of LLMs when processing low versus high relevance queries and when encountering out-of-distribution query and document sets. By examining these features within activations, we aim to enhance the interpretability and performance of LLMs in ranking tasks. Our findings provide valuable insights for the development of more effective and transparent ranking models, with significant implications for the broader information retrieval community. All scripts and code necessary to replicate our findings are made available.</description>

      <title>Smart ETL and LLM-based contents classification: the European Smart Tourism Tools Observatory experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Our research project focuses on improving the content update of the online European Smart Tourism Tools (STTs) Observatory by incorporating and categorizing STTs. The categorization is based on their taxonomy, and it facilitates the end user's search process. The use of a Smart ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process, where \emph{Smart} indicates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is central to this endeavor.
  Methods: The contents describing STTs are derived from PDF catalogs, where PDF-scraping techniques extract QR codes, images, links, and text information. Duplicate STTs between the catalogs are removed, and the remaining ones are classified based on their text information using Large Language Models (LLMs). Finally, the data is transformed to comply with the Dublin Core metadata structure (the observatory's metadata structure), chosen for its wide acceptance and flexibility.
  Results: The Smart ETL process to import STTs to the observatory combines PDF-scraping techniques with LLMs for text content-based classification. Our preliminary results have demonstrated the potential of LLMs for text content-based classification.
  Conclusion: The proposed approach's feasibility is a step towards efficient content-based classification, not only in Smart Tourism but also adaptable to other fields. Future work will mainly focus on refining this classification process.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Training for Recommendation with Language-based User Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many online platforms maintain user profiles for personalization. Unfortunately, these profiles are typically not interpretable or easily modifiable by the user. To remedy this shortcoming, we explore natural language-based user profiles, as they promise enhanced transparency and scrutability of recommender systems. While existing work has shown that language-based profiles from standard LLMs can be effective, such generalist LLMs are unlikely to be optimal for this task. In this paper, we introduce LangPTune, the first end-to-end learning method for training LLMs to produce language-based user profiles that optimize recommendation effectiveness. Through comprehensive evaluations of LangPTune across various training configurations and benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing profile-based methods. In addition, it approaches performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art, less transparent recommender systems, providing a robust and interpretable alternative to conventional systems. Finally, we validate the relative interpretability of these language-based user profiles through user studies involving crowdworkers and GPT-4-based evaluations. Implementation of LangPTune can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/LangPTune.</description>

      <title>Context-Augmented Code Generation Using Programming Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code-LLMs (CLLMs) have significantly improved code generation, but, they frequently face difficulties when dealing with challenging and complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the inference time. However, retrieval models often fail to find most relevant context, and generation models, with limited context capacity, can hallucinate when given irrelevant data. We present a novel framework that leverages a Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code. This approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most relevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning technique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more hallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two retrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing context granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our method improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 34% on MBPP. Our contributions include PKG-based retrieval, tree pruning to enhance retrieval precision, a re-ranking method for robust solution selection and a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) enhancer module for automatic code augmentation with relevant comments and docstrings.</description>

      <title>Link, Synthesize, Retrieve: Universal Document Linking for Zero-Shot Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent advancements in information retrieval (IR), zero-shot IR remains a significant challenge, especially when dealing with new domains, languages, and newly-released use cases that lack historical query traffic from existing users. For such cases, it is common to use query augmentations followed by fine-tuning pre-trained models on the document data paired with synthetic queries. In this work, we propose a novel Universal Document Linking (UDL) algorithm, which links similar documents to enhance synthetic query generation across multiple datasets with different characteristics. UDL leverages entropy for the choice of similarity models and named entity recognition (NER) for the link decision of documents using similarity scores. Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the UDL across diverse datasets and IR models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot cases.

      <title>Little Giants: Synthesizing High-Quality Embedding Data at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation has become an increasingly popular way of training models without the need for large, manually labeled datasets. For tasks like text embedding, synthetic data offers diverse and scalable training examples, significantly reducing the cost of human annotation. However, most current approaches rely heavily on proprietary models like GPT-4, which are expensive and inefficient for generating large-scale embedding data. In this paper, we introduce SPEED, a framework that aligns open-source small models (8B) to efficiently generate large-scale synthetic embedding data. Through supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and self-improvement, SPEED enables small open-source models to produce high-quality data. Remarkably, SPEED uses only less than 1/10 of the GPT API calls, outperforming the state-of-the-art embedding model E5_mistral when both are trained solely on their synthetic data. Using this efficient generator, we conduct a comprehensive study on how various factors within the alignment pipeline impact data quality and reveal the scaling law for synthetic embedding data.</description>

      <title>Attention-based Citywide Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Prediction Approach Considering Urban Region and Dynamic Influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicle charging demand prediction is important for vacant charging pile recommendation and charging infrastructure planning, thus facilitating vehicle electrification and green energy development. The performance of previous spatio-temporal studies is still far from satisfactory because the traditional graphs are difficult to model non-pairwise spatial relationships and multivariate temporal features are not adequately taken into account. To tackle these issues, we propose an attention-based heterogeneous multivariate data fusion approach (AHMDF) for citywide electric vehicle charging demand prediction, which incorporates geo-based clustered hypergraph and multivariate gated Transformer to considers both static and dynamic influences. To learn non-pairwise relationships, we cluster service areas by the types and numbers of points of interest in the areas and develop attentive hypergraph networks accordingly. Graph attention mechanisms are used for information propagation between neighboring areas. Additionally, we improve the Transformer encoder utilizing gated mechanisms so that it can selectively learn dynamic auxiliary information and temporal features. Experiments on an electric vehicle charging benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with a broad range of competing baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of dynamic influences on prediction results in different areas of the city and the effectiveness of our clustering method.</description>

      <title>CoLLM: Integrating Collaborative Embeddings into Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models as Recommenders (LLMRec) has gained significant attention and introduced fresh perspectives in user preference modeling. Existing LLMRec approaches prioritize text semantics, usually neglecting the valuable collaborative information from user-item interactions in recommendations. While these text-emphasizing approaches excel in cold-start scenarios, they may yield sub-optimal performance in warm-start situations. In pursuit of superior recommendations for both cold and warm start scenarios, we introduce CoLLM, an innovative LLMRec methodology that seamlessly incorporates collaborative information into LLMs for recommendation. CoLLM captures collaborative information through an external traditional model and maps it to the input token embedding space of LLM, forming collaborative embeddings for LLM usage. Through this external integration of collaborative information, CoLLM ensures effective modeling of collaborative information without modifying the LLM itself, providing the flexibility to employ various collaborative information modeling techniques. Extensive experiments validate that CoLLM adeptly integrates collaborative information into LLMs, resulting in enhanced recommendation performance. We release the code and data at https://github.com/zyang1580/CoLLM.</description>

      <title>Post-Training Attribute Unlearning in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing privacy concerns in recommender systems, recommendation unlearning is getting increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly use training data, i.e., model inputs, as unlearning target. However, attackers can extract private information from the model even if it has not been explicitly encountered during training. We name this unseen information as \textit{attribute} and treat it as unlearning target. To protect the sensitive attribute of users, Attribute Unlearning (AU) aims to make target attributes indistinguishable. In this paper, we focus on a strict but practical setting of AU, namely Post-Training Attribute Unlearning (PoT-AU), where unlearning can only be performed after the training of the recommendation model is completed. To address the PoT-AU problem in recommender systems, we propose a two-component loss function. The first component is distinguishability loss, where we design a distribution-based measurement to make attribute labels indistinguishable from attackers. We further extend this measurement to handle multi-class attribute cases with efficient computational overhead. The second component is regularization loss, where we explore a function-space measurement that effectively maintains recommendation performance compared to parameter-space regularization. We use stochastic gradient descent algorithm to optimize our proposed loss. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Safe machine learning model release from Trusted Research Environments: The SACRO-ML package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SACRO-ML, an integrated suite of open source Python tools to facilitate the statistical disclosure control (SDC) of machine learning (ML) models trained on confidential data prior to public release. SACRO-ML combines (i) a SafeModel package that extends commonly used ML models to provide ante-hoc SDC by assessing the vulnerability of disclosure posed by the training regime; and (ii) an Attacks package that provides post-hoc SDC by rigorously assessing the empirical disclosure risk of a model through a variety of simulated attacks after training. The SACRO-ML code and documentation are available under an MIT license at https://github.com/AI-SDC/SACRO-ML</description>

      <title>GPT vs RETRO: Exploring the Intersection of Retrieval and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have become popular methods for adapting large language models while minimizing compute requirements. In this paper, we apply PEFT methods (P-tuning, Adapters, and LoRA) to a modified Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) and a baseline GPT model across several sizes, ranging from 823 million to 48 billion parameters. We show that RETRO models outperform GPT models in zero-shot settings due to their unique pre-training process but GPT models have higher performance potential with PEFT. Additionally, our study indicates that 8B parameter models strike an optimal balance between cost and performance and P-tuning lags behind other PEFT techniques. We further provide a comparative analysis between applying PEFT to an Instruction-tuned RETRO model and base RETRO model. This work presents the first comprehensive comparison of various PEFT methods integrated with RAG, applied to both GPT and RETRO models, highlighting their relative performance.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,384 real-world queries spanning diverse domains, such as economics, psychology, mathematics, and coding. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring and carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023), which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10, produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.3 on BRIGHT. We show that incorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from the top-performing retriever boosts question-answering performance by over 6.6 points. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings.</description>

      <title>Disjointness Violations in Wikidata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disjointness checks are among the most important constraint checks in a knowledge base and can be used to help detect and correct incorrect statements and internal contradictions. Wikidata is a very large, community-managed knowledge base. Because of both its size and construction, Wikidata contains many incorrect statements and internal contradictions. We analyze the current modeling of disjointness on Wikidata, identify patterns that cause these disjointness violations and categorize them. We use SPARQL queries to identify each ``culprit'' causing a disjointness violation and lay out formulas to identify and fix conflicting information. We finally discuss how disjointness information could be better modeled and expanded in Wikidata in the future.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Correlation-Aware Table Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of data lakes for managing relational data necessitates efficient, open storage formats that provide high scan performance and competitive compression ratios. While existing formats achieve fast scans through lightweight encoding techniques, they have reached a plateau in terms of minimizing storage footprint. Recently, correlation-aware compression schemes have been shown to reduce file sizes further. Yet, current approaches either incur significant scan overheads or require manual specification of correlations, limiting their practicability. We present $\texttt{Virtual}$, a framework that integrates seamlessly with existing open formats to automatically leverage data correlations, achieving substantial compression gains while having minimal scan performance overhead. Experiments on data-gov datasets show that $\texttt{Virtual}$ reduces file sizes by up to 40% compared to Apache Parquet.</description>
