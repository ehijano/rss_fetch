      <title>Statistical Inference in Tensor Completion: Optimal Uncertainty Quantification and Statistical-Computational Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet efficient method for statistical inference of tensor linear forms with incomplete and noisy observations. Under the Tucker low-rank tensor model, we utilize an appropriate initial estimate, along with a debiasing technique followed by a one-step power iteration, to construct an asymptotic normal test statistic. This method is suitable for various statistical inference tasks, including confidence interval prediction, inference under heteroskedastic and sub-exponential noises, and simultaneous testing. Furthermore, the approach reaches the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for statistical estimation on Riemannian manifolds, indicating its optimality for uncertainty quantification. We comprehensively discusses the statistical-computational gaps and investigates the relationship between initialization and bias-correlation approaches. The findings demonstrate that with independent initialization, statistically optimal sample sizes and signal-to-noise ratios are sufficient for accurate inferences. Conversely, when initialization depends on the observations, computationally optimal sample sizes and signal-to-noise ratios also guarantee asymptotic normality without the need for data-splitting. The phase transition of computational and statistical limits is presented. Numerical simulations results conform to the theoretical discoveries.</description>

      <title>Impact of existence and nonexistence of pivot on the coverage of empirical best linear prediction intervals for small areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advance the theory of parametric bootstrap in constructing highly efficient empirical best (EB) prediction intervals of small area means. The coverage error of such a prediction interval is of the order $O(m^{-3/2})$, where $m$ is the number of small areas to be pooled using a linear mixed normal model. In the context of an area level model where the random effects follow a non-normal known distribution except possibly for unknown hyperparameters, we analytically show that the order of coverage error of empirical best linear (EBL) prediction interval remains the same even if we relax the normality of the random effects by the existence of pivot for a suitably standardized random effects when hyperpameters are known. Recognizing the challenge of showing existence of a pivot, we develop a simple moment-based method to claim non-existence of pivot. We show that existing parametric bootstrap EBL prediction interval fails to achieve the desired order of the coverage error, i.e. $O(m^{-3/2})$, in absence of a pivot. We obtain a surprising result that the order $O(m^{-1})$ term is always positive under certain conditions indicating possible overcoverage of the existing parametric bootstrap EBL prediction interval. In general, we analytically show for the first time that the coverage problem can be corrected by adopting a suitably devised double parametric bootstrap. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed single bootstrap method performs reasonably well when compared to rival methods.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference for ergodic diffusion with Markovian switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a Gaussian quasi-likelihood approach for estimating parameters of diffusion processes with Markovian regime switching. Assuming the ergodicity under high-frequency sampling, we will show the asymptotic normality of the unknown parameters contained in the drift and diffusion coefficients and present a consistent explicit estimator for the generator of the Markov chain. Simulation experiments are conducted to illustrate the theoretical results obtained.</description>

      <title>On the lack of weak continuity of Chatterjee's correlation coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chatterjee's correlation coefficient has recently been proposed as a new association measure for bivariate random vectors that satisfies a number of desirable properties. Among these properties is the feature that the coefficient equals one if and only if one of the variables is a measurable function of the other. As already observed in Mikusinski, Sherwood and Taylor (Stochastica, 13(1):61-74, 1992), this property implies that Chatterjee's coefficient is not continuous with respect to weak convergence. We discuss a number of negative consequences for statistical inference. In particular, we show that asymptotic tests for stochastic independence based on Chatterjee's empirical correlation coefficient, or boosted versions thereof, have trivial power against certain alternatives for which the population coefficient is one.</description>

      <title>Measure estimation on a manifold explored by a diffusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the observation of a diffusion path $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ on a compact connected $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ without boundary, we consider the problem of estimating the stationary measure $\mu$ of the process. Wang and Zhu (2023) showed that for the Wasserstein metric $W_2$ and for $d\ge 5$, the convergence rate of $T^{-1/(d-2)}$ is attained by the occupation measure of the path $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ when $(X_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ is a Langevin diffusion. We extend their result in several directions. First, we show that the rate of convergence holds for a large class of diffusion paths, whose generators are uniformly elliptic. Second, the regularity of the density $p$ of the stationary measure $\mu$ with respect to the volume measure of $M$ can be leveraged to obtain faster estimators: when $p$ belongs to a Sobolev space of order $\ell&gt;0$, smoothing the occupation measure by convolution with a kernel yields an estimator whose rate of convergence is of order $T^{-(\ell+1)/(2\ell+d-2)}$. We further show that this rate is the minimax rate of estimation for this problem.</description>

      <title>Models for spatiotemporal data with some missing locations and application to emergency calls models calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two classes of models for spatiotemporal data: one without covariates and one with covariates. If $\mathcal{T}$ is a partition of time and $\mathcal{I}$ a partition of the studied area into zones and if $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of arrival types, we assume that the process of arrivals for time interval $t \in \mathcal{T}$, zone $i \in \mathcal{I}$, and arrival type $c \in \mathcal{C}$ is Poisson with some intensity $\lambda_{c,i,t}$. We discussed the calibration and implementation of such models in \cite{laspatedpaper, laspatedmanual} with corresponding software LASPATED (Library for the Analysis of SPAtioTEmporal Discrete data) available on GitHub at https://github.com/vguigues/LASPATED. In this paper, we discuss the extension of these models when some of the locations are missing in the historical data. We propose three models to deal with missing locations and implemented them both in Matlab and C++. The corresponding code is available on GitHub as an extension of LASPATED at https://github.com/vguigues/LASPATED/Missing_Data. We tested our implementation using the process of emergency calls to an Emergency Health Service where many calls come with missing locations and show the importance and benefit of using models that consider missing locations, rather than discarding the calls with missing locations for the calibration of statistical models for such calls.</description>

      <title>Which Spaces can be Embedded in $L_p$-type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space? A Characterization via Metric Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11116v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a novel connection between the metric entropy growth and the embeddability of function spaces into reproducing kernel Hilbert/Banach spaces. Metric entropy characterizes the information complexity of function spaces and has implications for their approximability and learnability. Classical results show that embedding a function space into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) implies a bound on its metric entropy growth. Surprisingly, we prove a \textbf{converse}: a bound on the metric entropy growth of a function space allows its embedding to a $L_p-$type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space (RKBS). This shows that the ${L}_p-$type RKBS provides a broad modeling framework for learnable function classes with controlled metric entropies. Our results shed new light on the power and limitations of kernel methods for learning complex function spaces.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Theory for Estimation of the Husler-Reiss Distribution via Block Maxima Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The H\"usler-Reiss distribution describes the limit of the pointwise maxima of a bivariate normal distribution. This distribution is defined by a single parameter, $\lambda$. We provide asymptotic theory for maximum likelihood estimation of $\lambda$ under a block maxima approach. Our work assumes independent and identically distributed bivariate normal random variables, grouped into blocks where the block size and number of blocks increase simultaneously. With these assumptions our results provide conditions for the asymptotic normality of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). We characterize the bias of the MLE, provide conditions under which this bias is asymptotically negligible, and discuss how to choose the block size to minimize a bias-variance trade-off. The proofs are an extension of previous results for choosing the block size in the estimation of univariate extreme value distributions (Dombry and Ferreria 2019), providing a potential basis for extensions to multivariate cases where both the marginal and dependence parameters are unknown. The proofs rely on the Argmax Theorem applied to a localized loglikelihood function, combined with a Lindeberg-Feller Central Limit Theorem argument to establish asymptotic normality. Possible applications of the method include composite likelihood estimation in Brown-Resnick processes, where it is known that the bivariate distributions are of H\"usler-Reiss form.</description>

      <title>Bivariate dynamic conditional failure extropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nair and Sathar (2020) introduced a new metric for uncertainty known as dynamic failure extropy, focusing on the analysis of past lifetimes. In this study, we extend this concept to a bivariate context, exploring various properties associated with the proposed bivariate measure. We show that bivariate conditional failure extropy can uniquely determine the joint distribution function. Additionally, we derive characterizations for certain bivariate lifetime models using this measure. A new stochastic ordering, based on bivariate conditional failure extropy, is also proposed, along with some established bounds. We further develop an estimator for the bivariate conditional failure extropy using a smoothed kernel and empirical approach. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated through simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Structured Optimal Variational Inference for Dynamic Latent Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a latent space model for dynamic networks, where our objective is to estimate the pairwise inner products plus the intercept of the latent positions. To balance posterior inference and computational scalability, we consider a structured mean-field variational inference framework, where the time-dependent properties of the dynamic networks are exploited to facilitate computation and inference. Additionally, an easy-to-implement block coordinate ascent algorithm is developed with message-passing type updates in each block, whereas the complexity per iteration is linear with the number of nodes and time points. To certify the optimality, we demonstrate that the variational risk of the proposed variational inference approach attains the minimax optimal rate with only a logarithm factor under certain conditions. To this end, we first derive the minimax lower bound, which might be of independent interest. In addition, we show that the posterior under commonly adopted Gaussian random walk priors can achieve the minimax lower bound with only a logarithm factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such a throughout theoretical analysis of Bayesian dynamic latent space models. Simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology and the efficiency of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Efficient Fusion of Individual Data and Summary Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00200v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose we have individual data from an internal study and various summary statistics from relevant external studies. External summary statistics have the potential to improve statistical inference for the internal population; however, it may lead to efficiency loss or bias if not used properly. We study the fusion of individual data and summary statistics in a semiparametric framework to investigate the efficient use of external summary statistics. Under a weak transportability assumption, we establish the semiparametric efficiency bound for estimating a general functional of the internal data distribution, which is no larger than that using only internal data and underpins the potential efficiency gain of integrating individual data and summary statistics. We propose a data-fused efficient estimator that achieves this efficiency bound. In addition, an adaptive fusion estimator is proposed to eliminate the bias of the original data-fused estimator when the transportability assumption fails. We establish the asymptotic oracle property of the adaptive fusion estimator. Simulations and application to a Helicobacter pylori infection dataset demonstrate the promising numerical performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Limit Distribution Theory for Quantum Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimation of quantum relative entropy and its R\'{e}nyi generalizations is a fundamental statistical task in quantum information theory, physics, and beyond. While several estimators of these divergences have been proposed in the literature along with their computational complexities explored, a limit distribution theory which characterizes the asymptotic fluctuations of the estimation error is still premature. As our main contribution, we characterize these asymptotic distributions in terms of Fr\'{e}chet derivatives of elementary operator-valued functions. We achieve this by leveraging an operator version of Taylor's theorem and identifying the regularity conditions needed. As an application of our results, we consider an estimator of quantum relative entropy based on Pauli tomography of quantum states and show that the resulting asymptotic distribution is a centered normal, with its variance characterized in terms of the Pauli operators and states. We utilize the knowledge of the aforementioned limit distribution to obtain asymptotic performance guarantees for a multi-hypothesis testing problem.</description>
