      <title>Buoyancy torques prevent low-mass planets from stalling in low-turbulence radiative disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass planets migrating inwards in laminar protoplanetary disks (PPDs) experience a dynamical corotation torque, which is expected to slow down migration to a stall. However, baroclinic effects can reduce or even reverse this effect, leading to rapid inward migration. In the radiatively inefficient inner disk, one such mechanism is the buoyancy response of the disk to an embedded planet. Recent work has suggested that radiative cooling can quench this response, but for parameters that are not necessarily representative of the inner regions of PPDs. We perform global three dimensional inviscid radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet-disk interaction to investigate the effect of radiative cooling on the buoyancy-driven torque in a more realistic disk model. We find that the buoyancy response exerts a negative dynamical corotation torque -- albeit partially damped due to radiative cooling -- resulting in sustained, rapid inward migration. Models that adopt a local cooling prescription significantly overestimate the impact of the buoyancy response, highlighting the importance of a realistic treatment of radiation transport that includes radiative diffusion. Our results suggest that low-mass planets should migrate inwards faster than has been previously expected in radiative disks, with implications for the formation and orbital distribution of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes at intermediate distances from their host stars, unless additional physical processes that can slow down migration are considered.</description>

      <title>High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of warm Jupiters: An ESPRESSO sample with predictions for ANDES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm Jupiters are ideal laboratories for testing the limitations of current tools for atmospheric studies. The cross-correlation technique is a commonly used method to investigate the atmospheres of close-in planets, leveraging their large orbital velocities to separate the spectrum of the planet from that of the star. Warm Jupiter atmospheres predominantly consist of molecular species, notably water, methane and carbon monoxide, often accompanied by clouds and hazes muting their atmospheric features. In this study, we investigate the atmospheres of six warm Jupiters K2-139 b, K2-329 b, TOI- 3362 b, WASP-130 b, WASP-106 b, and TOI-677 b to search for water absorption using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, reporting non-detections for all targets. These non-detections are partially attributed to planets having in-transit radial velocity changes that are typically too small to distinguish between the different components (star, planet, Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and telluric contamination), as well as the relatively weak planetary absorption lines as compared to the S/N of the spectra. We simulate observations for the upcoming high-resolution spectrograph ANDES at the Extremely Large Telescope for the two favourable planets on eccentric orbits, TOI-3362b and TOI-677 b, searching for water, carbon monoxide, and methane. We predict a significant detection of water and CO, if ANDES indeed covers the K-band, in the atmospheres of TOI-677 b and a tentative detection of water in the atmosphere of TOI-3362b. This suggests that planets on highly eccentric orbits with favourable orbital configurations present a unique opportunity to access cooler atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Composition Tracking for Collisions Between Differentiated Bodies in REBOUND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research suggests that impacts between planetary embryos and planetesimals during the late stages of planet formation can often determine the percentages of core and mantle material that compose the newly formed planets in a system. Previous studies have attempted to include the composition-changing effects of these collisions in N-body simulations of planet formation, often as post-processing codes. In this paper, we present the Differentiated Body Composition Tracker, a new post-processing tool that uses collisional data collected from the N-body integrator REBOUND to determine the amount of core and mantle material that is transferred between colliding objects and the resulting fragments during an impact. We demonstrate how this code works using the data from 50 REBOUND simulations of planet formation and explore how the parameters in the code affect the core mass fractions of the remaining objects from these simulations. We then investigate how non-uniform distributions of core material across an initial disc affect the final core mass fractions of planets. Under ideal conditions, we find that a combination of giant impacts and planetary embryos enriched in core material could create some of the iron-rich planets that have been discovered.</description>

      <title>Satellite Drag Analysis During the May 2024 Geomagnetic Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between May 10-12, 2024, Earth saw its largest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years. Since the last major storm in 2003, the population of satellites in low Earth orbit has surged following the commercialization of space services and the ongoing establishment of proliferated LEO constellations. In this note, we investigate the various impacts of the geomagnetic storm on satellite operations. A forecast performance assessment of the geomagnetic index ap shows that the magnitude and duration of the storm were poorly predicted, even one day in advance. Total mass density enhancements in the thermosphere are identified by tracking satellite drag decay characteristics. A history of two-line element (TLE) data from the entire NORAD catalog in LEO is used to observe large-scale trends. Better understanding how geomagnetic storms impact satellite operations is critical for maintaining satellite safety and ensuring long-term robust sustainability in LEO.</description>

      <title>Forming the Trappist-1 system in two steps during the recession of the disc inner edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trappist-1 hosts 7 planets where period ratios of neighbouring pairs are close to the 8:5, 5:3, 3:2, 3:2, 4:3, and 3:2 ratios in increasing distance from the star. The Laplace angles associated with neighbouring triplets are observed to be librating, proving the resonant nature of the system. This compact, resonant configuration is a manifest sign of disc-driven migration; however, the preferred outcome of such evolution is the establishment of first-order resonances, not the high-order resonances observed in the inner system. Here, we explain the observed orbital configuration in a model that is largely independent on the specific disc migration and orbital circularisation efficiencies. Together with migration, the two key elements of our model are: i) the inner border of the protoplanetary disc receded with time; and ii) the system was initially separated in two sub-systems. Specifically, the inner b, c d and e planets were initially placed in a 3:2 resonance chain and then evolved to the 8:5 -- 5:3 commensurability between planets b, c and d under the effect of the recession of the inner edge of the disc, whereas the outer planets migrated to the inner edge at a later time, establishing the remaining resonances. Our results pivot on the dynamical role of the presently unobservable recession of the inner edge of protoplanetary discs. They also reveal the role of recurring phases of convergent migration followed by resonant repulsion with associated orbital circularisation when resonant chains interact with migration barriers.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the formation history and composition of Kepler planets from their distribution of orbital period ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kepler high-precision planetary sample has revealed a radius valley, separating compact super-Earths from sub-Neptunes with lower density. Super-Earths are generally assumed to be rocky planets that were probably born in-situ, while the composition and origin of sub-Neptunes remains debated. To provide more constraints on the formation history and composition, based on the planetary sample of Kepler multiple planet systems, we derive the distributions of orbital period ratios of sub-Neptune and super-Earth planet pairs and calculate the normalised fraction of near-first-order mean motion resonances. Using synthetic planetary systems generated by the Generation III Bern Model, we also obtain theoretical predictions of period ratio distributions of planet pairs of different compositions and origins. We find that actual Kepler sub-Neptune pairs show a normalised fraction smaller (larger) than the model predictions for water-rich (water-poor) pairs with confidence levels of about two sigma. The derived normalised fraction of actual Kepler Super-Earth pairs is generally consistent with that of water-poor model planet pairs but significantly smaller than that of synthetic water-rich planet pairs. Based on the distributions of orbital period ratios, we conclude that orbital migration has been more important for sub-Neptunes than for super-Earths, suggesting a partial ex situ formation of the former and an origin of the radius valley caused in part by distinct formation pathways. However, the model comparisons also show that sub-Neptunes in actual Kepler multiple systems are not likely to be all water-rich/ex situ planets but a mixture of the two (in situ/ex situ) pathways. Whereas, Kepler super-Earth planets are predominantly composed by of water-poor planets that were born inside the ice line, likely through a series of giant impacts without large scale migration.</description>

      <title>TOI-837 b: characterisation, formation and evolutionary history of an infant warm Saturn-mass planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to determine the fundamental properties of the $\sim$35 Myr old star TOI-837 and its close-in Saturn-sized planet, and to investigate the system's formation and evolutionary history. We analysed TESS photometry and HARPS spectroscopic data, measured stellar and planetary parameters, and characterised the stellar activity. We performed population synthesis simulations to track the formation history of TOI-837 $b$, and to reconstruct its possible internal structure. We investigated the planetary atmospheric evolution through photo-evaporation, and quantified the prospects for atmospheric characterisation with JWST. TOI-837 $b$ has radius and mass similar to those of Saturn ($r_b$=9.71$^{+0.93}_{-0.60}$ \rearth, $m_b$=116$^{+17}_{-18}$ M$_\odot$, and $\rho_b$=0.68$^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$ gcm$^{-3}$), on a primordial circular orbit. Population synthesis and early migration simulations suggest that the planet could have originated between 2-4 au, and have either a large and massive core, or a smaller Saturn-like core, depending on the opacity of the protoplanetary gas and on the growth rate of the core. We found that photo-evaporation produced negligible effects even at early ages (3-10 Myr). Transmission spectroscopy with JWST is very promising, and expected to provide constraints on atmospheric metallicity, abundance of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ molecules, and to probe the presence of refractory elements. TOI-837 offers valuable prospects for follow-up observations, which are needed for a thorough characterisation. JWST will help to better constraining the formation and evolution history of the system, and understand whether TOI-837 $b$ is a Saturn-analogue.</description>

      <title>A formation pathway for terrestrial planets with moderate water content involving atmospheric-volatile recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the many recently discovered terrestrial exoplanets, some are expected to harbor moderate water mass fractions of a few percent. The formation pathways that can produce planets with these water mass fractions are not fully understood. Here, we use the code chemcomp, which consists of a semi-analytical 1D protoplanetary disk model harboring a migrating and accreting planet, to model the growth and composition of planets with moderate water mass fractions by pebble accretion in a protoplanetary disk around a TRAPPIST-1 analog star. This star is accompanied by seven terrestrial planets, of which the outer four planets likely contain water mass fractions of between 1\% and 10\%. We adopt a published model that considers the evaporation of pebbles in the planetary envelope, from where recycling flows can transport the volatile vapor back into the disk. We find that with this model, the planetary water content depends on the influx rate of pebbles onto the planet. A decreasing pebble influx with time reduces the envelope temperature and consequently allows the formation of planets with moderate water mass fractions as inferred for the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets for a number of different simulation configurations. This is further evidence that the recycling of vapor is an important component of planet formation needed to explain the vast and diverse population of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Probing atmospheric escape through metastable He I triplet lines in 15 exoplanets observed with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several years, the metastable helium triplet line has been successfully used as a tracer to probe atmospheric escape in transiting exoplanets. This absorption in the near-infrared (1083.3 nm) can be observed from the ground using high-resolution spectroscopy, providing new constraints on the mass-loss rate and the temperature characterizing the upper atmosphere of close-in exoplanets.
  The aim of this work is to search for the He triplet signature in 15 transiting exoplanets -- ranging from super-Earths to ultrahot Jupiters -- observed with SPIRou, a high-resolution (R~70 000) near-infrared spectropolarimeter at the CFHT, in order to bring new constraints or to improve existing ones regarding atmospheric escape through a homogeneous study.
  We developed a full data processing and analysis pipeline to correct for the residual telluric and stellar contributions. We then used two different 1D models based on the Parker-wind equations and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer to interpret the observational results.
  We confirm published He triplet detections for HAT-P-11 b, HD 189733 b, and WASP-69 b. We tentatively detect the signature of escaping He in HD 209458 b, GJ 3470 b, and WASP-76 b. We report new constraints on the mass-loss rate and temperature for our three detections and set upper limits for the tentative and nondetections. We notably report improved constraints on the mass-loss rate and temperature of the escaping gas for TOI-1807 b, and report a nondetection for the debated atmospheric escape in GJ 1214 b. We also conducted the first search for the He signature in GJ 486 b since its discovery and report a nondetection of the He triplet. Finally, we studied the impact of important model assumptions on our retrieved parameters, notably the limitations of 1D models and the influence of the H/He ratio on the derived constraints.</description>

      <title>The CUISINES Framework for Conducting Exoplanet Model Intercomparison Projects, Version 1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As JWST begins to return observations, it is more important than ever that exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly predict the observability of exoplanets, retrieval of their data, and interpretation of planetary environments from that data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial role in this context, especially now when few data are available to validate model predictions. The CUISINES Working Group of NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) supports a systematic approach to evaluating the performance of exoplanet models, and provides here a framework for conducting community-organized exoplanet Model Intercomparison Projects (exoMIPs). The CUISINES framework adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for the needs of exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of model types, planetary targets, and parameter space studies. It is intended to help researchers to work collectively, equitably, and openly toward common goals. The CUISINES framework rests on five principles: 1) Define in advance what research question(s) the exoMIP is intended to address. 2) Create an experimental design that maximizes community participation, and advertise it widely. 3) Plan a project timeline that allows all exoMIP members to participate fully. 4) Generate data products from model output for direct comparison to observations. 5) Create a data management plan that is workable in the present and scalable for the future. Within the first years of its existence, CUISINES is already providing logistical support to 10 exoMIPs, and will continue to host annual workshops for further community feedback and presentation of new exoMIP ideas.</description>

      <title>Different Planetary Eccentricity-Period (PEP) Distributions of Small- and Giant-Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used the database of $1040$ short-period ($1 \leq P &lt; 200$ days) exoplanets radial-velocity (RV) orbits to study the planetary eccentricity-period (PEP) distribution. We first divided the sample into low- and high-mass exoplanet sub-samples based on the distribution of the (minimum) planetary masses, which displays a clear two-Gaussian distribution, separated at $0.165M_J$. We then selected $216$ orbits, low- and high-mass alike, with eccentricities significantly distinct from circular orbits. The $131$ giant-planet eccentric orbits display a clear upper envelope, which we model quantitatively, rises monotonically from zero eccentricity and reaches an eccentricity of $0.8$ at $P \sim 100$ days. Conversely, the $85$ low-mass planetary orbits display a flat eccentricity distribution between $0.1$ and $0.5$, with almost no dependence on the orbital period. We show that the striking difference between the two PEP distributions is not a result of the detection technique used. The upper envelope of the high-mass planets, also seen in short-period binary stars, is a clear signature of tidal circularization, which probably took place inside the planets, while the small-planet PEP distribution suggests that the circularization was not effective, probably due to dynamical interactions with neighboring planets.</description>

      <title>More Likely Than You Think: Inclination-Driving Secular Resonances are Common in Known Exoplanet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-planet systems face significant challenges to detection. For example, further orbiting planets have reduced signal-to-noise ratio in radial velocity detection methods, and small mutual inclinations between planets can prevent them from all transiting. One mechanism to excite mutual inclination between planets is secular resonance, where the nodal precession frequencies of the planets align such as to greatly increase the efficiency of angular momentum transport between planets. These resonances can significantly misalign planets from one another, hindering detection, and typically can only occur when there are three or more planets in the system. Naively, systems can only be in resonance for particular combinations of planet semimajor axes and masses; however, effects that alter the nodal precession frequencies of the planets, such as the decay of stellar oblateness, can significantly expand the region of parameter space where resonances occur. In this work, we explore known three-planet systems, determine whether they are in (or were in) secular resonance due to evolving stellar oblateness, and demonstrate the implications of resonance on their detectability and stability. We show that about 20% of a sample of three planet transiting systems seem to undergo these resonances early in their lives.</description>

      <title>Spatially variable crater morphology on the dwarf planet Haumea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haumea, thought to be the Kuiper Belt's 3rd most massive object, has a fast 3.92 hr rotational period, resulting in its shape as a triaxial ellipsoid. Here, we make the first detailed predictions of Haumea's surface morphology, considering in particular effects stemming from its unique shape. Given observations have indicated Haumea's surface to be predominantly inert water ice, we predict crater characteristics, with craters likely to be the predominant surface feature on Haumea. In calculating Haumea's surface gravity, we find that g varies by almost two orders of magnitude, from a minimum of 0.0126 m/s^2 at the location of the equatorial major axis, to 1.076 m/s^2 at the pole. We also find a non-monotonic decrease in g with latitude. The simple to complex crater transition diameter varies from 36.2 km at Haumea's location of minimum surface gravity to 6.1 km at the poles. Equatorial craters are expected to skew to larger volumes, have depths greater by a factor of &gt; 2, and have thicker ejecta when compared with craters at high latitudes. Considering implications for escape of crater ejecta, we calculate that Haumea's escape velocity varies by 62% from equator to pole. Despite higher escape velocities at the poles, impacts there are expected to have a higher mass fraction of ejecta escape from Haumea's gravitational well. Haumea may be unique among planet-sized objects in the solar system in possessing dramatic variations in crater morphology across its surface, stemming solely from changes in the magnitude of its surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Follow-up LOFAR observations of the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Observing the radio emission from exoplanets is among the most promising methods to detect their magnetic fields and a measurement of an exoplanetary magnetic field will help constrain the planet's interior structure, star-planet interactions, atmospheric escape and dynamics, and habitability. Recently, circularly polarized bursty and slow emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis ($\tau$ Boo) exoplanetary system was tentatively detected using LOFAR (LOW-Frequency ARray) beamformed observations. If confirmed, this detection will be a major contribution to exoplanet science. However, follow-up observations are required to confirm this detection.
  Aims. Here, we present such follow-up observations of the $\tau$ Boo system using LOFAR. These observations cover 70$\%$ of the orbital period of $\tau$ Boo b including the orbital phases of the previous tentative detections.
  Methods. We used the BOREALIS pipeline to mitigate radio frequency interference and to search for bursty and slowing varying radio signals. BOREALIS was previously used to find the tentative radio signals from $\tau$ Boo.
  Results. Our new observations do not show any signs of bursty or slow emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system.
  Conclusions. The cause for our non-detection is currently degenerate. It is possible that the tentative radio signals were an unknown instrumental systematic or that we are observing variability in the planetary radio emission due to changes in its host star. More radio data (preferably multi-site) and ancillary observations (e.g. magnetic maps) are required to further investigate the potential radio emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system.</description>

      <title>Binary asteroid candidates in Gaia DR3 astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asteroids with companions constitute an excellent sample for studying the collisional and dynamical evolution of minor planets. The currently known binary population were discovered by different complementary techniques that produce, for the moment, a strongly biased distribution, especially in a range of intermediate asteroid sizes (approximately 20 to 100 km) where both mutual photometric events and high-resolution adaptive optic imaging are poorly efficient. A totally independent technique of binary asteroid discovery, based on astrometry, can help to reveal new binary systems and populate a range of sizes and separations that remain nearly unexplored. In this work, we describe a dedicated period detection method and its results for the Gaia DR3 data set. This method looks for the presence of a periodic signature in the orbit post-fit residuals. After conservative filtering and validation based on statistical and physical criteria, we are able to present a first sample of astrometric binary candidates, to be confirmed by other observation techniques such as photometric light curves and stellar occultations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178b. Constraints on atmospheric chemistry and dynamics from a joint retrieval of VLT/CRIRES$^+$ and space photometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in the spectroscopic characterization of individual exoplanets, the atmospheres of key ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) still lack comprehensive investigations. These include WASP-178b, one of the most irradiated UHJs known to date. We observed the dayside emission signal of this planet with CRIRES$^+$ in the spectral K-band. By applying the cross-correlation technique and a Bayesian retrieval framework to the high-resolution spectra, we identified the emission signature of $^{12}$CO (S/N = 8.9) and H$_2$O (S/N = 4.9), and a strong atmospheric thermal inversion. A joint retrieval with space-based secondary eclipse measurements from TESS and CHEOPS allows us to refine our results on the thermal profile and thus to constrain the atmospheric chemistry, yielding a solar to super-solar metallicity (1.4$\pm$1.6 dex) and a solar C/O ratio (0.6$\pm$0.2). We infer a significant excess of spectral line broadening and identify a slight Doppler-shift between the $^{12}$CO and H$_2$O signals. These findings provide strong evidence for a super-rotating atmospheric flow pattern and suggest the possible existence of chemical inhomogeneities across the planetary dayside hemisphere. In addition, the inclusion of photometric data in our retrieval allows us to account for stellar light reflected by the planetary atmosphere, resulting in an upper limit on the geometric albedo (0.23). The successful characterization of WASP-178b's atmosphere through a joint analysis of CRIRES$^+$, TESS, and CHEOPS observations highlights the potential of combined studies with space- and ground-based instruments and represents a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The atmospheric composition of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178 b observed with ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for atmospheric constituents for the UHJ WASP-178 b with two ESPRESSO transits using the narrow-band and cross-correlation techniques, focusing on the detections of NaI, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, MgI, FeI and FeII. Additionally, we show parallel photometry used to obtain updated and precise stellar, planetary and orbital parameters. We report the resolved line detections of NaI (5.5 and 5.4 $\sigma$), H$\alpha$ (13 $\sigma$), H$\beta$ (7.1 $\sigma$), and tentatively MgI (4.6 $\sigma$). In cross-correlation, we confirm the MgI detection (7.8 and 5.8 $\sigma$) and additionally report the detections of FeI (12 and 10 $\sigma$) and FeII (11 and 8.4 $\sigma$), on both nights separately. The detection of MgI remains tentative, however, due to the differing results between both nights, as well as compared with the narrow-band derived properties. None of our resolved spectral lines probing the mid- to upper atmosphere show significant shifts relative to the planetary rest frame, however H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ exhibit line broadenings of 39.6 $\pm$ 2.1 km/s and 27.6 $\pm$ 4.6 km/s, respectively, indicating the onset of possible escape. WASP-178 b differs from similar UHJ with its lack of strong atmospheric dynamics in the upper atmosphere, however the broadening seen for FeI (15.66 $\pm$ 0.58 km/s) and FeII (11.32 $\pm$ 0.52 km/s) could indicate the presence of winds in the mid-atmosphere. Future studies on the impact of the flux variability caused by the host star activity might shed more light on the subject. Previous work indicated the presence of SiO cloud-precursors in the atmosphere of WASP-178 b and a lack of MgI and FeII. However, our results suggest that a scenario where the planetary atmosphere is dominated by MgI and FeII is more likely. In light of our results, we encourage future observations to further elucidate these atmospheric properties.</description>

      <title>NIRPS first light and early science: breaking the 1 m/s RV precision barrier at infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher or NIRPS is a precision radial velocity spectrograph developed through collaborative efforts among laboratories in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil, France, Portugal and Spain. NIRPS extends to the 0.98-1.8 $\mu$m domain of the pioneering HARPS instrument at the La Silla 3.6-m telescope in Chile and it has achieved unparalleled precision, measuring stellar radial velocities in the infrared with accuracy better than 1 m/s. NIRPS can be used either stand-alone or simultaneously with HARPS. Commissioned in late 2022 and early 2023, NIRPS embarked on a 5-year Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program in April 2023, spanning 720 observing nights. This program focuses on planetary systems around M dwarfs, encompassing both the immediate solar vicinity and transit follow-ups, alongside transit and emission spectroscopy observations. We highlight NIRPS's current performances and the insights gained during its deployment at the telescope. The lessons learned and successes achieved contribute to the ongoing advancement of precision radial velocity measurements and high spectral fidelity, further solidifying NIRPS' role in the forefront of the field of exoplanets.</description>
