      <title>Connected components of generalized strata of meromorphic differentials with residue conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized strata of meromorphic differentials are loci within the usual strata of differentials where certain sets of residues sum to zero. They naturally appear in the boundary of the multi-scale compactification of the usual strata. The classification of generalized strata is a key step towards understanding the irreducible components of the boundary strata of the multi-scale compactification. The connected components of generalized strata of residueless differentials were classified in \cite{lee2023connected}. In the present paper, we classify the connected components of generalized strata of meromorphic differentials in full generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a somewhat informal introduction to the integrable systems approach to the Schottky problem, explaining how the theta functions of Jacobians can be used to provide solutions of the KP equation, and culminating with the exposition of Krichever's proof of Welters' trisecant conjecture in the most degenerate (flex line) case.</description>

      <title>Hassett--Keel Program in genus four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hassett--Keel program seeks to give a modular interpretation to the steps of the log minimal model program of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_g$. The goal of this paper is to complete the Hassett--Keel program in genus four, supplementing earlier results of Casalaina-Martin--Jensen--Laza and Alper--Fedorchuk--Smyth--van der Wyck. The main tools we use are wall crossing for moduli spaces of pairs in the sense of K-stability and KSBA stability, and the recently constructed moduli spaces of boundary polarized Calabi--Yau surface pairs. We also give a construction of the hyperelliptic flip using a stackified Chow quotient which is expected to generalize to higher genus.</description>

      <title>Prekosmic Grothendieck/Galois Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a generalized version of the duality between groups and the categories of their representations on sets. Given an abstract symmetric monoidal category $K$ called Galois prekosmos, we define pre-Galois objects in $K$ and study the categories of their representations internal to $K$. The motivating example of $K$ is the cartesian monoidal category $\textit{Set}$ of sets, and pre-Galois objects in $\textit{Set}$ are groups. We present an axiomatic definition of pre-Galois $K$-categories, which is a complete abstract characterization of the categories of representations of pre-Galois objects in $K$. The category of covering spaces over a well-connected topological space is a prototype of a pre-Galois $\textit{Set}$-category. We establish a perfect correspondence between pre-Galois objects in $K$ and pre-Galois $K$-categories pointed with pre-fiber functors.
  We also establish a generalized version of the duality between flat affine group schemes and the categories of their linear representations. Given an abstract symmetric monoidal category $K$ called Grothendieck prekosmos, we define what are pre-Grothendieck objects in $K$ and study the categories of their representations internal to $K$. The motivating example of $K$ is the symmetric monoidal category $\textit{Vec}_k$ of vector spaces over a field $k$, and pre-Grothendieck objects in $\textit{Vec}_k$ are affine group $k$-schemes. We present an axiomatic definition of pre-Grothendieck $K$-categories, which is a complete abstract characterization of the categories of representations of pre-Grothendieck objects in $K$. The indization of a neutral Tannakian category over a field $k$ is a prototype of a pre-Grothendieck $\textit{Vec}_k$-category. We establish a perfect correspondence between pre-Grothendieck objects in $K$ and pre-Grothendieck $K$-categories pointed with pre-fiber functors.</description>

      <title>Type A algebraic coherence conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pappas-Rapoport coherence conjecture, proved by Zhu, states that the dimensions of spaces of sections of certain line bundles coincide. The two sides of the equality correspond to the line bundles on spherical Schubert varieties in the affine Grassmannians and to the line bundles on unions of Schubert varieties in affine flag varieties. Algebraically the claim can be reformulated as an equality between dimensions of certain Demazure modules and certain sums of Demazure modules. The goal of this paper is to formulate an algebraic construction providing an explicit link between the above mentioned Demazure modules. Our construction works only in type A, but it is applicable to a much wider class of representations than whose popping up in the geometric coherence conjecture. In the general case one side of conjectural equality involves the affine Kostant-Kumar modules.</description>

Abstract: This paper shows that a Poisson algebra is nilpotent if and only if it is both associative and Lie nilpotent and examines various properties of the nilradical and the solvable radical.

      <title>On the Grothendieck ring of varieties in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.02614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves two theorems (1) Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. I prove (Theorem 2.1.1) that if, $p &gt; 13$ or $p = 11$, then the isomorphism class of any supersingular elliptic curve is a zero divisor in the ring of smooth, complete $k$-varieties and Bittner relations. In particular, this ring contains zero divisors. The proof proceeds via establishing (in Theorem 2.2.1) that the Albanese variety functor is a motivic measure. (2) I prove (Theorem 3.1) that the etale fundamental group of a smooth, proper variety over any alg. clsoed field k (in any characteristic) also provides a motivic measure on this ring. In particular, the etale fundamental group is a motivic measure on the Grothendieck ring of varieties over complex numbers.</description>

Abstract: We classify algebraic curves in $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ ($n \geq 2$) that are invariant under an infinite subgroup of $\operatorname{PGL}(n+1,\mathbb{C})$. In particular, we prove that any irreducible, non-degenerate, one-dimensional algebraic set in $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ invariant under an infinite subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{CP}^{n})$ must be projectively equivalent to a monomial curve.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the deformation theory of an object in an $n$-category is controlled by the its $n$-fold endomorphism algebra. This recovers Lurie's results on deforming objects and categories. We also generalize a previous result by Blanc et al. on deforming a category and an object simultaneously to the case of $n$-categories.</description>

      <title>On the stack of 0-dimensional coherent sheaves: motivic aspects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety. In this survey, we study (decompositions of) the motivic class, in the Grothendieck ring of stacks, of the stack $\mathscr{C}oh^n(X)$ of $0$-dimensional coherent sheaves of length $n$ on $X$. To do so, we review the construction of the support map $\mathscr{C}oh^n(X) \to \mathrm{Sym}^n(X)$ to the symmetric product and we prove that, for any closed point $p \in X$, the motive of the punctual stack $\mathscr{C}oh^n(X)_p$ parametrising sheaves supported at $p$ only depends on a formal neighbourhood of $p$. We perform the same analysis for the Quot-to-Chow morphism $\mathrm{Quot}_X(\mathcal E,n) \to \mathrm{Sym}^n(X)$, for a fixed sheaf $\mathcal E \in \mathrm{Coh}(X)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider two $S$-dual hyperspherical varieties of the group $G_2 \times \text{SL}(2)$: an equivariant slice for $G_2$, and the symplectic representation of $G_2 \times \text{SL}_2$ in the odd part of the basic classical Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}(3)$. For these varieties we check the equality of numbers of irreducible components of their Lagrangian subvarieties (zero levels of the moment maps of Borel subgroups' actions) conjectured in arXiv:2310.19770.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any algebraic connection on a vector bundle on a smooth complex algebraic curve determines an irregular class and in turn a fission tree at each puncture. The fission trees are the discrete data classifying the admissible deformation classes. Here we explain how to count the fission trees with given slope and number of leaves, in the untwisted case. This also leads to a clearer picture of the ``periodic table'' of the atoms that play the role of building blocks in 2d gauge theory.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the coherence conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherence conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport, proved by Zhu, asserts the equality of dimensions for the global sections of a line bundle over a spherical Schubert variety in the affine Grassmannian and those of another line bundle over a certain union of Schubert varieties in a partial affine flag variety. In this paper, we enhance this equality of dimensions to an isomorphism of representations, which leads to interesting consequences in the setting of affine Demazure modules. Zhu's proof of coherence conjcture and our comparison theorem are established by introducing a parahoric Bruhat-Tits group scheme $\mathcal{G}$ over the affine line that is ramified at $0$. We further strengthen this comparison by equipping any line bundle on the global affine Grassmannian of $\mathcal{G}$ with a unique equivariant structure under the global jet group scheme of $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We coin the term \emph{$T$-trivial varieties} to denote smooth proper schemes over ground fields $k$ whose tangent sheaf is free. Over the complex numbers, this are precisely the abelian varieties. However, Igusa observed that in characteristic $p\leq 3$ certain bielliptic surfaces are $T$-trivial. We show that $T$-trivial varieties $X$ separably dominated by abelian varieties $A$ can exist only for $p\leq 3$. Furthermore, we prove that every $T$-trivial variety, after passing to a finite \'etale covering, is fibered in $T$-trivial varieties with Betti number $b_1=0$. We also show that if some $n$-dimensional $T$-trivial $X$ lifts to characteristic zero and $p\geq 2n+2$ holds, it admits a finite \'etale covering by an abelian variety. Along the way, we establish several results about the automorphism group of abelian varieties, and the existence of relative Albanese maps.</description>

      <title>On The Smoothness of Cayley Conditions in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poncelet's porism concerns the existence of polygons simultaneously inscribed in one conic and circumscribed about another. Cayley's theorem provides algebraic conditions for such polygons to exist, expressed through the coefficients of a certain determinantal expansion. In this paper, we focus on the case of triangles and establish three main results concerning the geometry of the Cayley condition. First, we derive an explicit algebraic equation that defines the Cayley set - the locus of conic pairs admitting Poncelet triangles - and prove that this set is a constructible set in the space of conic pairs. Second, we demonstrate that the Cayley set is a smooth manifold by showing it is an open subset of the total space of a smooth trivial fiber bundle with fibers isomorphic to a quadric hypersurface. Finally, we formulate the Poncelet correspondence as a principal bundle whose fibers are complex tori (elliptic curves), proving that all elliptic curves arising from conic pairs in the Cayley set are isomorphic. This differential-geometric approach not only clarifies the structure of the solution space for Poncelet triangles.</description>

Abstract: We give a new axiomatic treatment of the Zilber trichotomy, and use it to complete the proof of the trichotomy for relics of algebraically closed fields, i.e., reducts of the ACF-induced structure on ACF-definable sets. More precisely, we introduce a class of geometric structures equipped with a Hausdorff topology, called \textit{Hausdorff geometric structures}. Natural examples include the complex field; algebraically closed valued fields; o-minimal expansions of real closed fields; and characteristic zero Henselian fields (in particular $p$-adically closed fields). We then study the Zilber trichotomy for relics of Hausdorff geometric structures, showing that under additional assumptions, every non-locally modular strongly minimal relic on a real sort interprets a one-dimensional group. Combined with recent results, this allows us to prove the trichotomy for strongly minimal relics on the real sorts of algebraically closed valued fields. Finally, we make progress on the imaginary sorts, reducing the trichotomy for \textit{all} ACVF relics (in all sorts) to a conjectural technical condition that we prove in characteristic $(0,0)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $(K,v)$ be a valued field. Take an extension of $v$ to a fixed algebraic closure $L$ of $K$. In this paper we show that an element $a\in L$ admits a complete distinguished chain over $K$ if and only if the extension $(K(a)|K,v)$ is defectless and unibranched. This characterization generalizes the known result in the henselian case. In particular, our result shows that if $a$ admits a complete distinguished chain over $K$, then it also admits one over the henselization; however, the converse may not be true. The main tool employed in our analysis is the stability of the $j$-invariant associated to a valuation transcendental extension under passage to the henselization.
  We also explore the stability of defectless simple extensions in the following sense: let $(K(X)|K,w)$ be a valuation transcendental extension with a pair of definition $(b,\gamma)$. Assume that either $(K(b)|K,v)$ is a defectless extension, or that $f(X)$ is a key polynomial for $w$ over $K$, where $f(X)$ is the minimal polynomial of $b$ over $K$. We show that then the extension $(K(b,X)|K(X),w)$ is defectless. In particular, the extension $(K(b,X)|K(X),w)$ is always defectless whenever $(b,\gamma)$ is a minimal pair of definition for $w$ over $K$.</description>
