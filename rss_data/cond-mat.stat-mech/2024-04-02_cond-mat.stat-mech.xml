      <title>Emergent Simplicities in the Living Histories of Individual Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organisms maintain the status quo, holding key physiological variables constant to within an acceptable tolerance, and yet adapt with precision and plasticity to dynamic changes in externalities. What organizational principles ensure such exquisite yet robust control of systems-level "state variables" in complex systems with an extraordinary number of moving parts and fluctuating variables? Here we focus on these issues in the specific context of intra- and intergenerational life histories of individual bacterial cells, whose biographies are precisely charted via high-precision dynamic experiments using the SChemostat technology. We highlight intra- and intergenerational scaling laws and other "emergent simplicities" revealed by these high-precision data. In turn, these facilitate a principled route to dimensional reduction of the problem, and serve as essential building blocks for phenomenological and mechanistic theory. Parameter-free data-theory matches for multiple organisms validate theory frameworks, and explicate the systems physics of stochastic homeostasis and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility as divergence from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entropy production is commonly used to gauge a system's distance from equilibrium, but this interpretation lacks formalization due to the absence of a natural equilibrium measure. This analysis shows that the entropy production of a Markov system measures its separation from specific equilibrium dynamics. These reference dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.</description>

      <title>Methods of Stochastic Field Theory in Non-Equilibrium Systems -- Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a couple of investigations related to symmetry breaking phenomena, 'spontaneous stochasticity' and 'ergodicity breaking' have led to significant impacts in a variety of fields related to the stochastic processes such as economics and finance. We investigate on the origins and effects of those original symmetries in the action from the mathematical and the effective field theory points of view. It is naturally expected that whenever the system respects any symmetry, it would be spontaneously broken once the system falls into a vacuum state which minimizes an effective action of the dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Transport Coefficients of relativistic matter: A detailed formalism with a gross knowledge of their magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present review article has attempted a compact formalism description of transport coefficient calculations for relativistic fluid, which is expected in heavy ion collision experiments. Here, we first address the macroscopic description of relativistic fluid dynamics and then its microscopic description based on the kinetic theory framework. We also address different relaxation time approximation-based models in Boltzmann transport equations, which make a sandwich between Macro and Micro frameworks of relativistic fluid dynamics and finally provide different microscopic expressions of transport coefficients like the fluid's shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. In the numeric part of this review article, we put stress on the two gross components of transport coefficient expressions: relaxation time and thermodynamic phase-space part. Then, we try to tune the relaxation time component to cover earlier theoretical estimations and experimental data-driven estimations for RHIC and LHC matter. By this way of numerical understanding, we provide the final comments on the values of transport coefficients and relaxation time in the context of the (nearly) perfect fluid nature of the RHIC or LHC matter.</description>

Abstract: We simulate phase separated fluids using the Cahn-Hillard fluctuating hydrodynamic (CH-FHD) model and measure the statistical properties of capillary waves generated by thermal fluctuations. Our measurements are in good agreement with stochastic lubrication theory and molecular dynamics simulations but differ significantly from recent CH-FHD results by Zhang et al. (Phys. Rev. E 109 024208 (2024)). Specifically, we find that capillary wave statistics at thermodynamic equilibrium are independent of transport properties, namely viscosity and species diffusion.</description>

      <title>Rugged potential of mean force and underscreening of polarizable colloids in concentrated electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses advanced numerical methods to estimate the mean force potential (PMF) between charged, polarizable colloidal particles in dense electrolytes. We observe that when the Debye screening length, $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$, is below the hydrated ion size, the PMF shows discernible oscillations, contrasting with the expected decay in DLVO theory. Our findings provide evidence for the existence of anomalous underscreening in electrostatically stabilized suspensions, potentially having significant implications for our understanding of colloidal stability and the forces that govern the behavior of concentrated charged soft matter systems beyond DLVO theory.</description>

      <title>Expansion of net correlations in terms of partial correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphical models are usually employed to represent statistical relationships between pairs of variables when all the remaining variables are fixed. In this picture, conditionally independent pairs are disconnected. In the real world, however, strict conditional independence is almost impossible to prove. Here we use a weaker version of the concept of graphical models, in which only the linear component of the conditional dependencies is represented. This notion enables us to relate the marginal Pearson correlation coefficient (a measure of linear marginal dependence) with the partial correlations (a measure of linear conditional dependence). Specifically, we use the graphical model to express the marginal Pearson correlation $\rho_{ij}$ between variables $X_i$ and $X_j$ as a sum of the efficacies with which messages propagate along all the paths connecting the variables in the graph. The expansion is convergent, and provides a mechanistic interpretation of how global correlations arise from local interactions. Moreover, by weighing the relevance of each path and of each intermediate node, an intuitive way to imagine interventions is enabled, revealing for example what happens when a given edge is pruned, or the weight of an edge is modified. The expansion is also useful to construct minimal equivalent models, in which latent variables are introduced to replace a larger number of marginalised variables. In addition, the expansion yields an alternative algorithm to calculate marginal Pearson correlations, particularly beneficial when partial correlation matrix inversion is difficult. Finally, for Gaussian variables, the mutual information is also related to message-passing efficacies along paths in the graph.</description>

      <title>Flow Of Information In a Mechanically Quenched Confined Flock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living entities in a group communicate and transfer information to one another for a variety of reasons. It might be for foraging food, migration, or escaping threats and obstacles, etc. They do so by interacting with each other and also with the environment. The tools from statistical mechanics and information theory can be useful to analyze the flow of information among the living entities modelled as active (i.e. self-propelling) particles. Here we consider the active particles confined in a circular trap. The self-organisation of the particles crucially depends on whether the trap boundary is soft or hard. We quench the trap boundary from soft to hard instantaneously. After the mechanical quench, the particles suddenly find themselves in a hard potential. The self-organised cluster of the active particles, which was stable when the boundary was soft, becomes unstable. The cluster undergoes extreme deformation after the quench to find another stable configuration suitable for the hard potential. Together with the structural relaxation, information regarding the quench also flows throughout the deforming cluster. Here, we quantify the flow of information by computing local transfer entropy. We find that the flow spans the whole cluster, propagating ballistically.</description>

      <title>Duality transformations and the entanglement entropy of gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in gauge theories is expected to provide insights into many fundamental phenomena, including confinement. However, calculations of quantities related to entanglement in gauge theories are limited by ambiguities that stem from the non-factorizability of the Hilbert space. In this work we study lattice gauge theories that admit a dual description in terms of spin models, for which the replica trick and R\'enyi entropies are well defined. In the first part of this work, we explicitly perform the duality transformation in a replica geometry, deriving the structure of a replica space for a gauge theory. Then, in the second part, we calculate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the entropic c-function of the $\Z_2$ gauge theory in three spacetime dimension, exploiting its dual description in terms of the three-dimensional Ising model.</description>

Abstract: We show that an ensemble of thermally weakly coupled geometrically frustrated systems (GFSs), which are constraint to reside at negative Boltzmann temperatures, is in equilibrium cooler than its constituents, and may even exhibit positive temperatures at low energies. The challenge for the second law of thermodynamics arising from potential heat flow related to the Boltzmann temperature gradient between a GFS and its ensemble is resolved by considering the energy fluctuations above the ground state, i.e. the most probable state of a GFS. They are comprised in the canonical temperature, derived from information theory. Whereas the Boltzmann temperature gradient reveals the direction of the stochastic drift of the most probable state of a GFS within its ensemble, canonical temperature gradients define that of heat flow.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamics of a quantum dot coupled to a finite-size reservoir</title>

Abstract: In nano-scale systems coupled to finite-size reservoirs, the reservoir temperature may fluctuate due to heat exchange between the system and the reservoirs. To date, a stochastic thermodynamic analysis of heat, work and entropy production in such systems is however missing. Here we fill this gap by analyzing a single-level quantum dot tunnel coupled to a finite-size electronic reservoir. The system dynamics is described by a Markovian master equation, depending on the fluctuating temperature of the reservoir. Based on a fluctuation theorem, we identify the appropriate entropy production that results in a thermodynamically consistent statistical description. We illustrate our results by analyzing the work production for a finite-size reservoir Szilard engine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a general framework for comparing two dynamical processes that describe the synchronization of oscillators coupled through networks of the same size. We introduce a measure of dissimilarity defined in terms of a metric on a hypertorus, allowing us to compare the phases of coupled oscillators. In the first part, this formalism is implemented to examine systems of networked identical phase oscillators that evolve with the Kuramoto model. In particular, we analyze the effect of the weight of an edge in the synchronization of two oscillators, the introduction of new sets of edges in interacting cycles, the effect of bias in the couplings, and the addition of a link in a ring. We also compare the synchronization of nonisomorphic graphs with four nodes. Finally, we explore the dissimilarities generated when we contrast the Kuramoto model with its linear approximation for different random initial phases in deterministic and random networks. The approach introduced provides a general tool for comparing synchronization processes on networks, allowing us to understand the dynamics of a complex system as a consequence of the coupling structure and the processes that can occur in it.</description>

      <title>Full Counting Statistics of Charge in Quenched Quantum Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unless constrained by symmetry, measurement of an observable on an ensemble of identical quantum systems returns a distribution of values which are encoded in the full counting statistics. While the mean value of this distribution is important for determining certain properties of a system, the full distribution can also exhibit universal behavior. In this paper we study the full counting statistics of particle number in one dimensional interacting Bose and Fermi gases which have been quenched far from equilibrium. In particular we consider the time evolution of the Lieb-Liniger and Gaudin-Yang models quenched from a Bose-Einstein condensate initial state and calculate the full counting statistics of the particle number within a subsystem. We show that the scaled cumulants of the charge in the initial state and at long times are simply related and in particular the latter are independent of the model parameters. Using the quasi-particle picture we obtain the full time evolution of the cumulants and find that although their endpoints are fixed, the finite time dynamics depends strongly on the model parameters. We go on to construct the scaled cumulant generating functions and from this determine the limiting charge probability distributions at long time which are shown to exhibit distinct non-trivial and non-Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a random matrix model of Kolmogorov-Zakharov turbulence in a nonlinear purely dynamical finite size system with many degrees of freedom. For the case of a direct cascade the energy and norm pumping takes place at low energy scales with absorption at high energies. For a pumping strength above a certain chaos border a global chaotic attractor appears with a stationary energy flow through a Hamiltonian inertial energy interval. In this regime, the steady-state norm distribution is described by an algebraic decay with an exponent in agreement with the Kolmogorov-Zakharov theory. Below the chaos border the system is located in the quasi-integrable regime similar to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory and the turbulence is suppressed. For the inverse cascade the system rapidly enters a strongly nonlinear regime where the weak turbulence description is invalid. We argue that such a dynamical turbulence is generic showing that it is present in other lattice models with disorder and Anderson localization. We point out that such dynamical models can be realized in multimode optical fibers.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of inertial particles under velocity resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate stochastic resetting in coupled systems involving two degrees of freedom, where only one variable is reset. The resetting variable, which we think of as hidden, indirectly affects the remaining observable variable through correlations. We derive the Fourier-Laplace transform of the observable variable's propagator and provide a recursive relation for all the moments, facilitating a comprehensive examination of the process. We apply this framework to inertial transport processes where we observe particle position while the velocity is hidden and is being reset at a constant rate. We show that velocity resetting results in a linearly growing spatial mean squared displacement at late times, independently of reset-free dynamics, due to resetting-induced tempering of velocity correlations. General expressions for the effective diffusion and drift coefficients are derived as function of resetting rate. Non-trivial dependence on the rate may appear due to multiple timescales and crossovers in the reset-free dynamics. An extension that incorporates refractory periods after each reset is considered, where the post-resetting pauses can lead to anomalous diffusive behavior. Our results are of relevance to a wide range of systems, including inertial transport where mechanical momentum is lost in collisions with the environment, or the behavior of living organisms where stop-and-go locomotion with inertia is ubiquitous. Numerical simulations for underdamped Brownian motion and the random acceleration process confirm our findings.</description>

      <title>Exploring Conformational Landscapes Along Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to automatize the identification of collective variables to simplify and speed up enhanced sampling simulations of conformational dynamics in biomolecules. We focus on anharmonic low-frequency vibrations that exhibit fluctuations on timescales faster than conformational transitions but describe a path of least resistance towards structural change. A key challenge is that harmonic approximations are ill-suited to characterize these vibrations, which are observed at far-infrared frequencies and are easily excited by thermal collisions at room temperature.
  Here, we approached this problem with a frequency-selective anharmonic (FRESEAN) mode analysis that does not rely on harmonic approximations and successfully isolates anharmonic low-frequency vibrations from short molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. We applied FRESEAN mode analysis to simulations of alanine dipeptide, a common test system for enhanced sampling simulation protocols, and compare the performance of isolated low-frequency vibrations to conventional user-defined collective variables (here backbone dihedral angles) in enhanced sampling simulations.
  The comparison shows that enhanced sampling along anharmonic low-frequency vibrations not only reproduces known conformational dynamics but can even further improve sampling of slow transitions compared to user-defined collective variables. Notably, free energy surfaces spanned by low-frequency anharmonic vibrational modes exhibit lower barriers associated with conformational transitions relative to representations in backbone dihedral space. We thus conclude that anharmonic low-frequency vibrations provide a promising path for highly effective and fully automated enhanced sampling simulations of conformational dynamics in biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Response: Equivalence between Thermodynamic Geometry and Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: A fundamental result of thermodynamic geometry is that the optimal, minimal-work protocol that drives a nonequilibrium system between two thermodynamic states in the slow-driving limit is given by a geodesic of the friction tensor, a Riemannian metric defined on control space. For overdamped dynamics in arbitrary dimensions, we demonstrate that thermodynamic geometry is equivalent to $L^2$ optimal transport geometry defined on the space of equilibrium distributions corresponding to the control parameters. We show that obtaining optimal protocols past the slow-driving or linear response regime is computationally tractable as the sum of a friction tensor geodesic and a counterdiabatic term related to the Fisher information metric. These geodesic-counterdiabatic optimal protocols are exact for parameteric harmonic potentials, reproduce the surprising non-monotonic behavior recently discovered in linearly-biased double well optimal protocols, and explain the ubiquitous discontinuous jumps observed at the beginning and end times.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the optimization optical machines with the planted solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce universal, easy-to-reproduce generative models for the QUBO instances to differentiate the performance of the hardware/solvers effectively. Our benchmark process extends the well-known Hebb's rule of associative memory with the asymmetric pattern weights. We provide a comprehensive overview of calculations conducted across various scales and using different classes of dynamical equations. Our aim is to analyze their results, including factors such as the probability of encountering the ground state, planted state, spurious state, or states falling outside the predetermined energy range. Moreover, the generated problems show additional properties, such as the easy-hard-easy complexity transition and complicated cluster structures of planted solutions. Our method establishes a prospective platform to potentially address other questions related to the fundamental principles behind device physics and algorithms for novel computing machines.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity for measurement-induced non-unitary dynamics and Zeno effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using spread complexity and spread entropy, we study non-unitary quantum dynamics. For non-hermitian Hamiltonians, we extend the bi-Lanczos construction for the Krylov basis to the Schr\"odinger picture. Moreover, we implement an algorithm adapted to complex symmetric Hamiltonians. This reduces the computational memory requirements by half compared to the bi-Lanczos construction. We apply this construction to the one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian subject to repeated measurements at fixed small time intervals, resulting in effective non-unitary dynamics. We find that the spread complexity initially grows with time, followed by an extended decay period and saturation. The choice of initial state determines the saturation value of complexity and entropy. In analogy to measurement-induced phase transitions, we consider a quench between hermitian and non-hermitian Hamiltonian evolution induced by turning on regular measurements at different frequencies. We find that as a function of the measurement frequency, the time at which the spread complexity starts growing increases. This time asymptotes to infinity when the time gap between measurements is taken to zero, indicating the onset of the quantum Zeno effect, according to which measurements impede time evolution.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence to an approximate solution by message-passing for complex optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message-passing (MP) is a powerful tool for finding an approximate solution in optimization. We generalize it to nonlinear product-sum form, and numerically show the fast convergence for the minimum feedback vertex set and the minimum vertex cover known as NP-hard problems. From the linearity of MP in a logarithmic space, it is derived that an equilibrium solution exists in a neighborhood of random initial values. These results will give one of the reason why the convergence is very fast in collective computation based on a common mathematical background.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric inference of higher order interaction patterns in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining parsimonious decompositions of networks into higher order interactions which can take the form of arbitrary motifs.The method is based on a class of analytically solvable generative models, where vertices are connected via explicit copies of motifs, which in combination with non-parametric priors allow us to infer higher order interactions from dyadic graph data without any prior knowledge on the types or frequencies of such interactions. Crucially, we also consider 'degree--corrected' models that correctly reflect the degree distribution of the network and consequently prove to be a better fit for many real world--networks compared to non-degree corrected models. We test the presented approach on simulated data for which we recover the set of underlying higher order interactions to a high degree of accuracy. For empirical networks the method identifies concise sets of atomic subgraphs from within thousands of candidates that cover a large fraction of edges and include higher order interactions of known structural and functional significance. The method not only produces an explicit higher order representation of the network but also a fit of the network to analytically tractable models opening new avenues for the systematic study of higher order network structures.</description>
