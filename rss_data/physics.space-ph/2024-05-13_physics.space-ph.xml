      <title>Microphysical Regulation of Non-Ideal MHD in Weakly-Ionized Systems: Does the Hall Effect Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the M1 and M2 layers in the undisturbed Martian ionosphere through solar minimum leading to solar maximum with MAVEN ROSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize data from the MAVEN Radio Occultation Science Experiment (Withers et al., 2020) - with unprecedented coverage in solar zenith angle - to isolate the effects that local time and season induce on the photochemical ionosphere of Mars around solar minimum, leading to solar maximum. 219 out of the 1228 electron density profiles of the Martian undisturbed - by solar events or dust storm - dayside ionosphere collected by MAVEN ROSE between July 2016 and December 2022 show a distinct M1 layer below the M2 layer. This allowed us to study the behavior of both the M2 and M1 peak densities and altitudes as a function of solar zenith angle, and, for the first time, to be able to separate these trends in dusk and dawn local time, as well as by Southern Spring and summer versus Southern Fall and Winter. We find that the M1 layer at small SZA can occur at altitudes lower than 100 km; that the peak altitudes and densities of both the M2 and M1 layers at dawn change more with season than they do at dusk; and that the M2 peak density decreases at a faster rate than the M1 with SZA.</description>
