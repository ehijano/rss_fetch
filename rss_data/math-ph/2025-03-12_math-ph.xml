      <title>On Minimizing Phase Space Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary technical challenge for harnessing fusion energy is to control and extract energy from a non-thermal distribution of charged particles. The fact that phase space evolves by symplectomorphisms fundamentally limits how a distribution may be manipulated. While the constraint of phase-space volume preservation is well understood, other constraints remain to be fully appreciated. To better understand these constraints, we study the problem of extracting energy from a distribution of particles using area-preserving and symplectic linear maps. When a quadratic potential is imposed, we find that the maximal extractable energy can be computed as trace minimization problems. We solve these problems and show that the extractable energy under linear symplectomorphisms may be much smaller than the extractable energy under special linear maps. The method introduced in the present study enables an energy-based proof of the linear Gromov non-squeezing theorem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Scattering Relation for the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. We justify the notion from the physics literature that this model can be thought of as a dense collection of solitons (or "soliton gas'') by, (i) precisely defining the locations of these solitons; (ii) showing that local charges and currents for the Toda lattice are well-approximated by simple functions of the soliton data; and (iii) proving an asymptotic scattering relation that governs the dynamics of the soliton locations. Our arguments are based on analyzing properties about eigenvector entries of the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix, particularly, their rates of exponential decay and their evolutions under inverse scattering.</description>

      <title>Cluster expansions of particle system state with topological nearest-neighbor interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article presents the concept of a cumulant representation for distribution functions describing the states of many-particle systems with topological nearest-neighbor interaction. A solution to the Cauchy problem for the hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations for the cumulants of distribution functions of such systems is constructed. The connection between the constructed solution and the series expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the BBGKY hierarchy has been established. Furthermore, the expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the hierarchy of evolution equations for reduced observables of topologically interacting particles is established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that any continuous function depending on several $p$-adic variables, each of which is defined on $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one $p$-adic variable. This statement is true for both functions with values in $\mathbb{R}$ and functions with values in $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.</description>

      <title>Limiting distributions of ergodic continuous-time quantum walks on periodic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository note, we study several families of periodic graphs which satisfy a sufficient condition for the ergodicity of the associated continuous-time quantum walk. For these graphs, we compute the limiting distribution of the walk explicitly. We uncover interesting behavior where in some families, the walk is ergodic in both horizontal and sectional directions, while in others, ergodicity only holds in the horizontal (large N) direction. We compare this to the limiting distribution of classical random walks on the same graphs.</description>

      <title>Star-products for Lie-algebraic noncommutative Minkowski space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poisson structures of the Poincar\'e group can be linked to deformations of the Minkowski space-time, classified some time ago. We construct the star-products and involutions characterizing the $*$-algebras of various quantum Minkowski space-times with non-centrally extended coordinates Lie algebras. We show that the usual Lebesgue integral defines either a trace or a KMS weight ("twisted trace") depending whether the Lie group of the coordinates' Lie algebra is unimodular or not. We determine the Hopf algebras modeling the deformed relativistic symmetries, which appear to be either a deformation of the usual (Hopf) Poincar\'e algebra or a deformation of an enlarged algebra. The results are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The paint group Tits Satake theory of hyperbolic symmetric spaces: the distance function, paint invariants and discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper, which is partially a review, but also contains several completely new results, aims at presenting, in a unified mathematical framework, a complex and articulated lore regarding non-compact symmetric spaces, with negative curvature, whose isometry group is a non-compact, real simple Lie group. All such manifolds are Riemannian normal manifolds, according to Alekseevsky's definition, in the sense that they are metrically equivalent to a solvable Lie group manifold. This identification provides a vision in which, on one side one can derive quite explicit and challenging formulae for the unique distance function between points of the manifold, on the other one, one can organize the entire set of the available manifolds in universality classes distinguished by their common Tits Satake submanifold and, correspondingly, by their non-compact rank. The members of the class are distinguished by their different Paint Groups, the latter notion having been introduced by two of the present authors in an earlier collaboration. In relation to the construction of neural networks, these mathematical structures offer unique possibilities of replacing ad hoc activation functions with the naturally defined non-linear operations that relate Lie algebras to Lie Groups and vice-versa. The Paint Group invariants offer new tokens both to construct algorithms and inspect (hopefully to control) their working. A conspicuous part of the paper is devoted to the study and systematic construction of parabolic/elliptic discrete subgroups of the Lie groups SO(r,r+q), in view of discretization and/or tessellations of the space to which data are to be mapped. Furthermore, it is shown how the ingredients of Special K\"ahler Geometry and the c-map, well known in the supergravity literature, provide a unified classification scheme of the relevant Tits Satake universality classes with non-compact rank r&lt;5.</description>

      <title>Geometric Delocalization in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of transient two-dimensional surfaces where a random-walking particle escapes to infinity in contrast to localization in standard flat 2D space. We first prove that any rotationally symmetric 2D membrane embedded in flat 3D space cannot be transient. Then we formulate a criterion for the transience of a general asymmetric 2D membrane. We use it to explicitly construct a class of transient 2D manifolds with a non-trivial metric and height function but ``zero average curvature,'' which we dub tablecloth manifolds. The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of a programmable time-crystal lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems whose ground state spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry and thus exhibits long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Using hydrodynamics, we have recently shown how an $m$th-order external packing field coupled to density fluctuations in driven diffusive fluids can induce the spontaneous emergence of time-crystalline order in the form of $m$ rotating condensates, which can be further controlled and modulated. Here we analyze this phenomenon at the microscopic level in a paradigmatic model of particle diffusion under exclusion interactions, a generalization of the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process with a configuration-dependent field called the time-crystal lattice gas. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the nonequilibrium phase transition to these complex time-crystal phases for different values of $m$, including the order parameter, the susceptibility and the Binder cumulant, from which we measure the critical exponents, which turn out to be within the Kuramoto universality class for oscillator synchronization. We also elucidate the condensates density profiles and velocities, confirming along the way a scaling property predicted for the higher-order condensate shapes in terms of first-order ones, discussing also novel possibilities for this promising route to time crystals.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics of hard rods from microscopics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact equations governing the large-scale dynamics of hard rods, including diffusive effects that go beyond ballistic transport. Diffusive corrections are the first-order terms in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion and we obtain them through an explicit microscopic calculation of the dynamics of hard rods. We show that they differ significantly from the prediction of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, as the correct hydrodynamics description is instead given by two coupled equations, giving respectively the evolution of the one point functions and of the connected two-point correlations. The resulting equations are time-reversible and reduce to the usual Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations in the limit of near-equilibrium evolution. This represents the first exact microscopic calculation showing how ballistic dynamics generates long-range correlations, in agreement with general results from the recently developed ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, and showing how such long range-correlations directly affect the diffusive hydrodynamic terms, in agreement with, and clarifying, recent related results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find empirically that the value of Feynman integrals follows a $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution at large loop order. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 18 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we extrapolate the value of this contribution to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Global Universality of Singular Values in Products of Many Large Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the singular values (and Lyapunov exponents) for products of $N$ independent $n\times n$ random matrices with i.i.d. entries. Such matrix products have been extensively analyzed using free probability, which applies when $n\to \infty$ at fixed $N$, and the multiplicative ergodic theorem, which holds when $N\to \infty$ while $n$ remains fixed. The regime when $N,n\to \infty$ simultaneously is considerably less well understood, and our work is the first to prove universality for the global distribution of singular values in this setting. Our main result gives non-asymptotic upper bounds on the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff distance between the empirical measure of (normalized) squared singular values and the uniform measure on $[0, 1]$ that go to zero when $n, N\to \infty$ at any relative rate. We assume only that the distribution of matrix entries has zero mean, unit variance, bounded fourth moment, and a bounded density. Our proofs rely on two key ingredients. The first is a novel small-ball estimate on singular vectors of random matrices from which we deduce a non-asymptotic variant of the multiplicative ergodic theorem that holds for growing matrix size $n$. The second is a martingale concentration argument, which shows that while Lyapunov exponents at large $N$ are not universal at fixed matrix size, their empirical distribution becomes universal as soon as the matrix size grows with $N$.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theories on quantum Minkowski spaces: $\rho$ versus $\kappa$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\rho$-Minkowski space-time, a Lie-algebraic deformation of the usual Minkowski space-time is considered. A star-product realization of this quantum space-time together with the characterization of the deformed Poincar\'e symmetry acting on it are presented. It is shown that appearance of UV/IR mixing is expected already in scalar field theories on $\rho$-Minkowski. Classical and one-loop features of a typical gauge theory on this quantum space-time are presented and critically compared to the situation for $\kappa$-Minkowski.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are widely used to describe complex dynamical systems with evolving parameters in nature and engineering. Effectively learning a family of maps from the parameter function to the system dynamics is of great significance. In this study, we propose a novel learning framework of symbolic continuous-depth neural networks, termed Symbolic Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (SNODEs), to effectively and accurately learn the underlying dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, our learning framework comprises three stages: initially, pre-training a predefined symbolic neural network via a gradient flow matching strategy; subsequently, fine-tuning this network using Neural ODEs; and finally, constructing a general neural network to capture residuals. In this process, we apply the SNODEs framework to partial differential equation systems through Fourier analysis, achieving resolution-invariant modeling. Moreover, this framework integrates the strengths of symbolism and connectionism, boasting a universal approximation theorem while significantly enhancing interpretability and extrapolation capabilities relative to state-of-the-art baseline methods. We demonstrate this through experiments on several representative complex systems. Therefore, our framework can be further applied to a wide range of scientific problems, such as system bifurcation and control, reconstruction and forecasting, as well as the discovery of new equations.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian integrable systems from constant non-invertible solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct invertible spectral parameter dependent Yang-Baxter solutions ($R$-matrices) by Baxterizing constant non-invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. The solutions are algebraic (representation independent). They are constructed using supersymmetry (SUSY) algebras. The resulting $R$-matrices are regular leading to local non-hermitian Hamiltonians written in terms of the SUSY generators. As particular examples we Baxterize the $4\times 4$ constant non-invertible solutions of Hietarinta leading to nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians. On comparing with the literature we find two of the models are new. Apart from being non-hermitian, many of them are also non-diagonalizable with interesting spectrums. With appropriate representations of the SUSY generators we obtain spin chains in all local Hilbert space dimensions.</description>

      <title>A simple model of quantum walk with a gap in distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks are quantum counterparts of random walks and their probability distributions are different from each other. A quantum walker distributes on a Hilbert space and it is observed at a location with a probability. The finding probabilities have been investigated and some interesting things have been analytically discovered. They are, for instance, ballistic behavior, localization, or a gap. We study a 1-dimensional quantum walk in this paper. Although the walker launches off a location under a localized initial state, some numerical experiments show that the quantum walker does not seem to distribute around the launching location, which suggests that the probability distribution holds a gap around the launching location. To prove the gap analytically, we derive a long-time limit distribution, from which one can tell more details about the finding probability.</description>

      <title>Scrambling for precision: optimizing multiparameter qubit estimation in the face of sloppiness and incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiparameter quantum estimation theory plays a crucial role in advancing quantum metrology. Recent studies focused on fundamental challenges such as enhancing precision in the presence of incompatibility or sloppiness, yet the relationship between these features remains poorly understood. In this work, we explore the connection between sloppiness and incompatibility by introducing an adjustable scrambling operation for parameter encoding. Using a minimal yet versatile two-parameter qubit model, we examine the trade-off between sloppiness and incompatibility and discuss: (1) how information scrambling can improve estimation, and (2) how the correlations between the parameters and the incompatibility between the symmetric logarithmic derivatives impose constraints on the ultimate quantum limits to precision. Through analytical optimization, we identify strategies to mitigate these constraints and enhance estimation efficiency. We also compare the performance of joint parameter estimation to strategies involving successive separate estimation steps, demonstrating that the ultimate precision can be achieved when sloppiness is minimized. Our results provide a unified perspective on the trade-offs inherent to multiparameter qubit statistical models, offering practical insights for optimizing experimental designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the oriented swap process on the positive integers and its asymptotic properties. Our results extend a theorem by Angel, Holroyd, and Romik regarding the trajectories of particles in the finite oriented swap process. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the type of a particle at the leftmost position over time. Our approach relies on a relationship between multi-species particle systems and Hecke algebras, complemented by a detailed asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the continuity of magnetization at the phase transition of the ferromagnetic XY model in the three-dimensional square lattice with the nearest neighborhood interaction. We assume that, at the critical temperature, with probability 1, for every edge in the infinite directed graph generated by the random path representation, finitely many edges exist so that they form a finite loop. Then, we prove that the phase transition is continuous at the critical temperature. The main technical contribution is to find a switching lemma to establish a bijection between equally weighted graphs.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our results generalize the classical (single-function) Strichartz estimates on compact manifolds by Kapitanski, Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Dinh, and extend the Euclidean orthonormal version by Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer, Frank-Sabin, Bez-Lee-Nakamura. On the flat torus, our new results cover prior work of Nakamura for the Schr\"odinger equation, which exploits the dispersive estimate of Kenig-Ponce-Vega. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. We observe a new phenomenon that the results in the supercritical regime are sensitive to the geometry of the manifold. Moreover, we establish sharp Strichartz estimates on the flat torus for the fractional Schr\"odinger equations by proving a new decoupling inequality for certain non-smooth hypersurfaces. As applications, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Effects of inertia on the asynchronous state of a disordered Kuramoto model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of inertia in the asynchronous state of a disordered Kuramoto model. We extend an iterative simulation scheme to the case of the Kuramoto model with inertia in order to determine the self-consistent fluctuation statistics, specifically, the power spectra of network noise and single oscillators. Comparison with network simulations demonstrates that this works well whenever the system is in an asynchronous state. We also find an unexpected effect when varying the degree of inertia: the correlation time of the oscillators becomes minimal at an intermediate mass of the oscillators; correspondingly, the power spectra appear flatter and thus more similar to white noise around the same value of mass. We also find a similar effect for the Lyapunov spectra of the oscillators when the mass is varied.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions of heat equation on unitary groups establish an improved relation between $\epsilon$-nets and approximate unitary $t$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concepts of $\epsilon$-nets and unitary ($\delta$-approximate) $t$-designs are important and ubiquitous across quantum computation and information. Both notions are closely related and the quantitative relations between $t$, $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ find applications in areas such as (non-constructive) inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev like theorems and random quantum circuits. In recent work, quantitative relations have revealed the close connection between the two constructions, with $\epsilon$-nets functioning as unitary $\delta$-approximate $t$-designs and vice-versa, for appropriate choice of parameters. In this work we improve these results, significantly increasing the bound on the $\delta$ required for a $\delta$-approximate $t$-design to form an $\epsilon$-net from $\delta \simeq \left(\epsilon^{3/2}/d\right)^{d^2}$ to $\delta \simeq \left(\epsilon/d^{1/2}\right)^{d^2}$. We achieve this by constructing polynomial approximations to the Dirac delta using heat kernels on the projective unitary group $\mathrm{PU}(d) \cong\mathbf{U}(d)$, whose properties we studied and which may be applicable more broadly. We also outline the possible applications of our results in quantum circuit overheads, quantum complexity and black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum K--theory of Grassmannians from a Yang-Baxter algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, two of the authors defined a $5$-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra (a Hopf algebra) which acts on the sum of the equivariant quantum K-rings of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, where $k$ varies from $0$ to $n$. We construct geometrically defined operators on quantum K-rings describing this action. In particular, the $R$-matrix defining the Yang-Baxter algebra corresponds to the left Weyl group action. Most importantly, we use the `quantum=classical' statement for the quantum K-theory of Grassmannians to prove an explicit geometric interpretation of the action of generators of the Yang-Baxter algebra. The diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix are given by quantum K-multiplications by explicitly defined classes, and the off-diagonal entries by certain push-pull convolutions. We use this to find a quantization of the classes of fixed points in the quantum K-rings, corresponding to the Bethe vectors of the Yang-Baxter algebra. On each of the quantum K-rings, we prove that the two Frobenius structures (one from geometry, and the other from the integrable system construction) coincide. We discuss several applications, including an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the quantum K-theory ring (extending the Seidel action), a quantum version of the localization map (which is a ring homomorphism with respect to the quantum K-product), and a graphical calculus to multiply by Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the dual of the tautological quotient bundle. In an Appendix we illustrate our results in the case when $n=2$.</description>

Abstract: We consider isotropic and Lagrangian embeddings of coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups into products of coadjoint orbits. After reviewing the known facts in the case of $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ we initiate a similar study for $\mathrm{SO}$ and $\mathrm{Sp}$ cases. In the second part we apply this to the study of dynamical systems with $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ symmetry, proving equivalence between systems of two types: those describing magnetic geodesic flow on flag manifolds and classical `spin chains' of a special type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in understanding charge transport at atomic scales. The motivations are myriad, including understanding the conductance properties of peptides measured experimentally. In this study, we propose a model of quantum statistical mechanics which aims to investigate the transport properties of 1D-semiconductor at nanoscales. The model is a two-band Hamiltonian in which electrons are assumed to be quasi-free. It allows us to investigate the behaviour of current and quantum fluctuations under the influence of numerous parameters, showing the response with respect to varying voltage, temperature and length. We compute the current observable at each site and demonstrate the local behaviour generating the current.</description>

      <title>Villain action in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Villain interaction applied to lattice gauge theory can be obtained as the limit of both Wilson and Manton interactions on a larger graph which we call the {\em carpet graph.} This is the lattice gauge theory analog of a well-known property for spin $O(N)$ models where Villain type interactions are the limit of $\mathbb{S}^{N-1}$ spin systems defined on a {\em cable graph}.
  Perhaps surprisingly in the setting of lattice gauge theory, our proof also applies to non-Abelian lattice theory such as $SU(3)$-lattice gauge theory and its limiting Villain interaction.
  In the particular case of an Abelian lattice gauge theory, this allows us to extend the validity of Ginibre inequality to the case of the Villain interaction.</description>

Abstract: We consider the higher order Schr\"odinger operator $H=(-\Delta)^m+V(x)$ in $n$ dimensions with real-valued potential $V$ when $n&gt;4m$, $m\in \mathbb N$. We adapt our recent results for $m&gt;1$ to show that when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for the natural range $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{2m}$ in both even and odd dimensions. The approach used works without distinguishing even and odd cases, and matches the range of boundedness in the classical case when $m=1$. The proof applies in the classical $m=1$ case as well and simplifies the argument.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of global solutions for a class of nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider global solutions of a class of non-linear wave equations of the form \begin{equation*}
  \Box u= N(x,t,u)u, \end{equation*} where the nonlinearity~$ N(x,t,u)u$ is assumed to satisfy appropriate boundedness assumptions.
  Under these appropriate assumptions we prove that the free channel wave operator exists. Moreover, if the interaction term~$N(x,t,u)u$ is localised, then we prove that the global solution of the full nonlinear equation can be decomposed into a `free' part and a `localised' part.
  The present work can be seen as an extension of the scattering results of~\cite{SW20221} for the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the exact Fourier dimension for all standard sub-critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the unit interval, thereby confirming the Garban-Vargas conjecture. The proof relies on a significant improvement of the vector-valued martingale method, initially developed by Chen-Han-Qiu-Wang in the studies of the Fourier dimensions of Mandelbrot cascade random measures.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <title>The anti-de Sitter supergeometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting, $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace $\mathsf{OSp}({\cal N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two frameworks are related. We give two explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe: (i) a two-parameter deformation of the $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ interval and the corresponding superparticle model; (ii) some implications of conformal flatness for superconformal higher-spin multiplets and an effective action generating the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Weyl anomaly; and (iii) $\kappa$-symmetry of the massless AdS superparticle.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Extension of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation: Theorems and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation (LCHS) formula [An, Liu, Lin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2023] to simulate time-evolution operators in infinite-dimensional spaces, including scenarios involving unbounded operators. This extension, named Inf-LCHS for short, bridges the gap between finite-dimensional quantum simulations and the broader class of infinite-dimensional quantum dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Furthermore, we propose two sampling methods by integrating the infinite-dimensional LCHS with Gaussian quadrature schemes (Inf-LCHS-Gaussian) or Monte Carlo integration schemes (Inf-LCHS-MC). We demonstrate the applicability of the Inf-LCHS theorem to a wide range of non-Hermitian dynamics, including linear parabolic PDEs, queueing models (birth-or-death processes), Schr\"odinger equations with complex potentials, Lindblad equations, and black hole thermal field equations. Our analysis provides insights into simulating general linear dynamics using a finite number of quantum dynamics and includes cost estimates for the corresponding quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spinning boson stars in nonlinear sigma models and Universal Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the scalar field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for a family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional target manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions, allowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness. However, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent with those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of such relations is extended to curved target spaces.</description>

      <title>Towards construction of superintegrable basis in matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop methods for systematic construction of superintegrable polynomials in matrix/eigenvalue models. Our consideration is based on a tight connection of superintegrable property of Gaussian Hermitian model and $W_{1 + \infty}$ algebra in Fock representation. Motivated by this example, we propose a set of assumptions that may allow one to recover superintegrable polynomials. The main two assumptions are box adding/removing rule (Pierri rule) and existence of Hamiltonian for superintegrable polynomials. We detail our method in case of the Gaussian Hermitian model, and then apply it to the cubic Kontsevich model.</description>
