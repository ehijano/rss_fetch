      <title>CSGO: Generalized Optimization for Cold Start in Wireless Collaborative Edge LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deploying large language models on edge devices promises low-latency and privacy-preserving AI services, it is hindered by limited device resources. Although pipeline parallelism facilitates distributed inference, existing approaches often ignore the cold-start latency caused by on-demand model loading. In this paper, we propose a latency-aware scheduling framework that overlaps model loading with computation and communication to minimize total inference latency. Based on device and model parameters, the framework dynamically adjusts layer partitioning and allocation to effectively hide loading time, thereby eliminating as many idle periods as possible. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program and design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to optimize model partitioning and device assignment. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces cold-start latency compared to baseline strategies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Quality-Latency Aware Routing for LLM Inference in Wireless Edge-Device Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Satellite Cooperative MIMO Transmission: Statistical CSI-Aware RSMA Precoding Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate inter-satellite cooperative transmission in a multiple low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system to enhance spectral efficiency. Specifically, we design multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) precoding at LEO satellites for cooperative rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Given the difficulty of acquiring instantaneous channel state information (iCSI) due to long delays and Doppler effects, we formulate an ergodic max-min fairness rate (MMFR) maximization problem based on statistical CSI (sCSI). To address the challenge of ergodic rate evaluation, we approximate the problem using closed-form upper bounds and develop a weighted minimum mean squared error-based algorithm to obtain a stationary point. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sCSI-based RSMA scheme approaches iCSI-based performance and significantly outperforms conventional space-division multiple access.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled Sensing: Cramer-Rao Bound Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as a more flexible solution to engineer the wireless propagation channels, thanks to its non-diagonal reflecting matrix. Although the gain of the BD-RIS over the conventional RIS in communication has been revealed in many works, its gain in 6G sensing is still unknown. This motivates us to study the BD-RIS assisted sensing in this letter. Specifically, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the angle-of-arrival (AOA) from the target to the BD-RIS under the constraint that the BD-RIS scattering matrix is unitary. To minimize the CRB, we develop an optimization scheme based on an adaptive Riemannian steepest ascent algorithm that can satisfy the non-convex unitary constraint. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BD-RIS-assisted target localization method achieves superior sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Rate-CRB Performance for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter considers a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the BD-RIS can help a multi-antenna base station (BS) serve multiple user equipments (UEs) and localize a target simultaneously. We formulate an optimization problem that designs the BS beamforming matrix and the BD-RIS scattering matrix to maximize UEs' sum rate subject to a localization Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraint and an additional unitary matrix constraint for the scattering matrix. Because unitary matrices form a manifold, our problem belongs to constrained manifold optimization. This letter proposes a log-barrier based Riemannian steepest ascent method to solve this problem effectively. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our algorithm and the performance gain of the BD-RIS aided ISAC systems over the conventional RIS aided ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Design of Pulse Shapes Based on Sampling with Gaussian Prefilter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2412</link>
      <description>arXiv:0907.2412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two new pulse shapes for communications are presented. The first pulse shape generates a set of pulses without intersymbol interference (ISI) or ISI-free for short. In the neighborhood of the origin it is similar in shape to the classical cardinal sine function but is of exponential decay at infinity. This pulse shape is identical to the interpolating function of a generalized sampling theorem with Gaussian prefilter. The second pulse shape is obtained from the first pulse shape by spectral factorization. Besides being also of exponential decay at infinity, it has a causal appearance since it is of superexponential decay for negative times. It is closely related to the orthonormal generating function considered earlier by Unser in the context of shift-invariant spaces. This pulse shape is not ISI-free but it generates a set of orthonormal pulses. The second pulse shape may also be used to define a receive matched filter so that at the filter output the ISI-free pulses of the first kind are recovered.</description>

      <title>On the Generic Capacity of $K$-User Symmetric Linear Computation Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear computation broadcast (LCBC) refers to a setting with $d$ dimensional data stored at a central server, where $K$ users, each with some prior linear side-information, wish to retrieve various linear combinations of the data. For each computation instance, the data is represented as a $d$-dimensional vector with elements in a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ where $p^n$ is a power of a prime. The computation is to be performed many times, and the goal is to determine the minimum amount of information per computation instance that must be broadcast to satisfy all the users. The reciprocal of the optimal broadcast cost is the capacity of LCBC. The capacity is known for up to $K=3$ users. Since LCBC includes index coding as a special case, large $K$ settings of LCBC are at least as hard as the index coding problem. Instead of the general setting (all instances), by focusing on the generic setting (almost all instances) this work shows that the generic capacity of the symmetric LCBC (where every user has $m'$ dimensions of side-information and $m$ dimensions of demand) for large number of users ($K&gt;d$ suffices) is $C_g=1/\Delta_g$, where $\Delta_g=\min\left\{\max\{0,d-m'\}, \frac{dm}{m+m'}\right\}$, is the broadcast cost that is both achievable and unbeatable asymptotically almost surely for large $n$, among all LCBC instances with the given parameters $p,K,d,m,m'$. Relative to baseline schemes of random coding or separate transmissions, $C_g$ shows an extremal gain by a factor of $K$ as a function of number of users, and by a factor of $\approx d/4$ as a function of data dimensions, when optimized over remaining parameters. For arbitrary number of users, the generic capacity of the symmetric LCBC is characterized within a factor of $2$.</description>

      <title>Capacity of Summation over a Symmetric Quantum Erasure MAC with Partially Replicated Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08386v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal quantum communication cost of computing a classical sum of distributed sources is studied over a quantum erasure multiple access channel (QEMAC). K classical messages comprised of finite-field symbols are distributed across $S$ servers, who also share quantum entanglement in advance. Each server $s\in[S]$ manipulates its quantum subsystem $\mathcal{Q}_s$ according to its own available classical messages and sends $\mathcal{Q}_s$ to the receiver who then computes the sum of the messages based on a joint quantum measurement. The download cost from Server $s\in [S]$ is the logarithm of the dimension of $\mathcal{Q}_s$. The rate $R$ is defined as the number of instances of the sum computed at the receiver, divided by the total download cost from all the servers. The main focus is on the symmetric setting with $K= {S \choose \alpha} $ messages where each message is replicated among a unique subset of $\alpha$ servers, and the answers from any $\beta$ servers may be erased. If no entanglement is initially available to the receiver, then we show that the capacity (maximal rate) is precisely $C= \max\left\{ \min \left\{ \frac{2(\alpha-\beta)}{S}, \frac{S-2\beta}{S} \right\}, \frac{\alpha-\beta}{S} \right\}$. The capacity with arbitrary levels of prior entanglement $(\Delta_0)$ between the $S$ data-servers and the receiver is also characterized, by including an auxiliary server (Server $0$) that has no classical data, so that the communication cost from Server $0$ is a proxy for the amount of receiver-side entanglement that is available in advance. The challenge on the converse side resides in the optimal application of the weak monotonicity property, while the achievability combines ideas from classical network coding and treating qudits as classical dits, as well as new constructions based on the $N$-sum box abstraction that rely on absolutely maximally entangled quantum states.</description>

      <title>Virtual Teleportation of CSIT via Non-Signaling Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-signaling correlations, which (strictly) include quantum correlations, provide a tractable path to explore the potential impact of quantum nonlocality on the capacity of classical communication networks. Motivated by a recent discovery that certain wireless network settings benefit significantly from non-signaling (NS) correlations, various generalizations are considered. First, it is shown that for a point to point discrete memoryless channel with a non-causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the NS-assisted Shannon capacity matches the classical (without NS assistance) capacity of the channel for the setting where the state is also made available to the receiver. The key insight is summarized as 'virtual teleportation of CSIT via NS-assistance' and is supported by further results as follows. For a discrete memoryless 2-user broadcast channel (BC), the Shannon capacity region with NS-assistance available only between the transmitter and User 1, is found next. Consistent with the aforementioned key insight, the result matches the classical capacity region for the setting where the desired message of User 2 is made available in advance as side-information to User 1. The latter capacity region is known from a result of Kramer and Shamai. Next, for a semi-deterministic BC, the Shannon capacity region with full (tripartite) NS-assistance is shown to be the same as if only bipartite NS-assistance was available between the transmitter and the non-deterministic user. Bipartite NS-assistance between the transmitter and only the deterministic user, does not improve the capacity region relative to the corresponding classical setting. Finally, the analysis is extended to a K-user BC with full NS-assistance among all parties.</description>

      <title>Secure Cooperative Gradient Coding: Optimality, Reliability, and Global Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies privacy-sensitive federated learning (FL) under unreliable communication, with a focus on secure aggregation and straggler mitigation. To preserve user privacy without compromising the utility of the global model, secure aggregation emerges as a promising approach by coordinating the use of privacy-preserving noise (secret keys) across participating clients. However, the unreliable communication will randomly disrupt the key coordination and disable the exact recovery of the global model in secure aggregation. Furthermore, unreliable communication can distort the optimization trajectory, causing the global model to deviate further from the intended global optimum.To address these challenges, we propose Secure Cooperative Gradient Coding (SecCoGC), a practical solution that achieves accurate aggregation with arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees and is inherently robust to communication uncertainties. To ensure fairness in privacy protection, we further introduce Fair-SecCoGC, an extension of SecCoGC that enforces equitable privacy preservation across all clients. Notably, Fair-SecCoGC achieves optimal privacy under a per-key total power constraint. We formally formulate the problem of secure aggregation in the real field and present both general and computationally efficient methods for secret key construction. Our privacy analysis covers both Local Mutual Information Privacy (LMIP) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) across all protocol layers, accounting for intermittent networks and correlation among secret keys. In addition, we characterize the system reliability and convergence properties of the proposed scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that SecCoGC achieves strong resilience to unreliable communication while maintaining arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees, yielding test accuracy improvements of 20% to 70% over existing privacy-preserving methods.</description>

      <title>infomeasure: A Comprehensive Python Package for Information Theory Measures and Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information theory, i.e. the mathematical analysis of information and of its processing, has become a tenet of modern science; yet, its use in real-world studies is usually hindered by its computational complexity, the lack of coherent software frameworks, and, as a consequence, low reproducibility. We here introduce infomeasure, an open-source Python package designed to provide robust tools for calculating a wide variety of information-theoretic measures, including entropies, mutual information, transfer entropy and divergences. It is designed for both discrete and continuous variables; implements state-of-the-art estimation techniques; and allows the calculation of local measure values, $p$-values and $t$-scores. By unifying these approaches under one consistent framework, infomeasure aims to mitigate common pitfalls, ensure reproducibility, and simplify the practical implementation of information-theoretic analyses. In this contribution, we explore the motivation and features of infomeasure; its validation, using known analytical solutions; and exemplify its utility in a case study involving the analysis of human brain time series.</description>
