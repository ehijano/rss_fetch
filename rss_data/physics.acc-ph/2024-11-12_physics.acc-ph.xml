      <title>Data-Driven Gradient Optimization for Field Emission Management in a Superconducting Radio-Frequency Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field emission can cause significant problems in superconducting radio-frequency linear accelerators (linacs). When cavity gradients are pushed higher, radiation levels within the linacs may rise exponentially, causing degradation of many nearby systems. This research aims to utilize machine learning with uncertainty quantification to predict radiation levels at multiple locations throughout the linacs and ultimately optimize cavity gradients to reduce field emission induced radiation while maintaining the total linac energy gain necessary for the experimental physics program. The optimized solutions show over 40% reductions for both neutron and gamma radiation from the standard operational settings.</description>

      <title>Monochromatization of $e^+e^-$ colliders with a large crossing angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13668v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relative center-of-mass energy spread at $e^+e^-$ colliders is about $10^{-3}$, which is much larger than the widths of narrow resonances J/$\psi$, $\psi$(2S), $\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S), $\Upsilon$(3S) mesons, tauonium and some others. It's reduction would significantly increase the resonance production rates and open up great opportunities in the search for new physics. In this paper, we propose a new monochromatization method for colliders with a large crossing angle (which can provide a high luminosity). The contribution of the beam energy spread to the spread of the center-of-mass energy is canceled by introducing an appropriate energy-angle correlation at the interaction point; $\sigma_W/W \sim (0.5-1)10^{-5}$ appears possible.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the blowout plasma wakefields produced by drive beams with elliptical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the underdense (blowout) regime of plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), the particle beam is denser than the plasma. Under these conditions, the plasma electrons are nearly completely rarefacted from the beam channel, resulting in a nominally uniform ion column. Extensive investigations of this interaction assuming axisymmetry have been undertaken. However, the plasma blowout produced by a transversely asymmetric driver possesses quite different characteristics. They create an asymmetric plasma rarefaction region (bubble) which leads to asymmetric focusing in the two transverse planes. This is also accompanied by an undesired non-uniform accelerating gradient. The asymmetric blowout cross-section is found through simulation to be elliptical, and treating it as such permits a simple extension of the symmetric theory. In particular, focusing fields linear in both transverse directions exist in the bubble. The form of the wake potential and the concomitant matching conditions in this elliptical cavity are discussed in this paper. We also discuss bubble boundary estimation in the long driver limit and applications of the asymmetric features of the wakefield.</description>
