      <title>Non-wellfounded parsimonious proofs and non-uniform complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the complexity-theoretical aspects of cyclic and non-wellfounded proofs in the context of parsimonious logic, a variant of linear logic where the exponential modality ! is interpreted as a constructor for streams over finite data. We present non-wellfounded parsimonious proof systems capturing the classes $\mathbf{FPTIME}$ and $\mathbf{FP}/\mathsf{poly}$. Soundness is established via a polynomial modulus of continuity for continuous cut-elimination. Completeness relies on an encoding of polynomial Turing machines with advice.
  As a byproduct of our proof methods, we establish a series of characterisation results for various finitary proof systems.</description>

      <title>Alternating Quantifiers in Uniform One-Dimensional Fragments with an Excursion into Three-Variable Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniform one-dimensional fragment of first-order logic was introduced a few years ago as a generalization of the two-variable fragment to contexts involving relations of arity greater than two. Quantifiers in this logic are used in blocks, each block consisting only of existential quantifiers or only of universal quantifiers. In this paper we consider the possibility of mixing both types of quantifiers in blocks. We show the finite (exponential) model property and NExpTime-completeness of the satisfiability problem for two restrictions of the resulting formalism: in the first we require that every block of quantifiers is either purely universal or ends with the existential quantifier, in the second we restrict the number of variables to three; in both equality is not allowed. We also extend the second variation to a rich subfragment of the three-variable fragment (without equality) that still has the finite model property and decidable, NExpTime{}-complete satisfiability.</description>

      <title>Permissible Knowledge Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information pooling has been extensively formalised across various logical frameworks in distributed systems, characterized by diverse information-sharing patterns. These approaches generally adopt an intersection perspective, aggregating all possible information, regardless of whether it is known or unknown to the agents. In contrast, this work adopts a unique stance, emphasising that sharing knowledge means distributing what is known, rather than what remains uncertain. This paper introduces a dynamic logic for knowledge pooling or sharing and further discusses a potential framework for permissible knowledge pooling.</description>

      <title>Model Checking Recursive Probabilistic Programs with Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of model checking temporal logic specifications for probabilistic programs with recursive procedures, nested queries, and conditioning expressed with observe statements. We introduce probabilistic Operator Precedence Automata (pOPA), a new class of probabilistic pushdown automata suitable to model constructs and behaviors of probabilistic programs. We develop a model checking algorithm that can verify requirements expressed in a fragment of Precedence Oriented Temporal Logic (POTL$^f_\mathcal{X}$) on a pOPA in single EXPTIME. POTL$^f_\mathcal{X}$ is a temporal logic based on Operator Precedence Languages, which features modalities that interact with the context-free structure of program traces, matching procedure calls with returns or observe statements. We provide the first probabilistic model checking implementation of context-free language properties for probabilistic pushdown systems.</description>

      <title>Bringing memory to Boolean networks: a unifying framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean networks are extensively applied as models of complex dynamical systems, aiming at capturing essential features related to causality and synchronicity of the state changes of components along time. Dynamics of Boolean networks result from the application of their Boolean map according to a so-called update mode, specifying the possible transitions between network configurations. In this paper, we explore update modes that possess a memory on past configurations, and provide a generic framework to define them. We show that recently introduced modes such as the most permissive and interval modes can be naturally expressed in this framework. We propose novel update modes, the history-based and trapping modes, and provide a comprehensive comparison between them. Furthermore, we show that trapping dynamics, which further generalize the most permissive mode, correspond to a rich class of networks related to transitive dynamics and encompassing commutative networks. Finally, we provide a thorough characterization of the structure of minimal and principal trapspaces, bringing a combinatorial and algebraic understanding of these objects.</description>

      <title>A topological reading of inductive and coinductive definitions in Dependent Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of dependent type theory, we show that coinductive predicates have an equivalent topological counterpart in terms of coinductively generated positivity relations, introduced by G. Sambin to represent closed subsets in point-free topology. Our work is complementary to a previous one with M.E. Maietti, where we showed that, in dependent type theory, the well-known concept of wellfounded trees has a topological equivalent counterpart in terms of proof-relevant inductively generated formal covers used to provide a predicative and constructive representation of complete suplattices. All proofs in Martin-L\"of's type theory are formalised in the Agda proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Two variable logic with ultimately periodic counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the extension of two variable logic with quantifiers that state that the number of elements where a formula holds should belong to a given ultimately periodic set. We show that both satisfiability and finite satisfiability of the logic are decidable. We also show that the spectrum of any sentence is definable in Presburger arithmetic. In the process we present several refinements to the ``biregular graph method''. In this method, decidability issues concerning two-variable logics are reduced to questions about Presburger definability of integer vectors associated with partitioned graphs, where nodes in a partition satisfy certain constraints on their in- and out-degrees.</description>

      <title>On two-variable guarded fragment logic with expressive local Presburger constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13731v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the extension of the two-variable guarded fragment logic with local Presburger quantifiers. These are quantifiers that can express properties such as "the number of incoming blue edges plus twice the number of outgoing red edges is at most three times the number of incoming green edges" and captures various description logics with counting, but without constant symbols. We show that the satisfiability problem for this logic is EXP-complete. While the lower bound already holds for the standard two-variable guarded fragment logic, the upper bound is established by a novel, yet simple deterministic graph-based algorithm.</description>
