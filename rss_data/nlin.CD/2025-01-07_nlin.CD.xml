      <title>Indicator Functions Detect Tangentially Transient Behaviour on Decaying Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay scenario of a codimension-2 NHIM in a three degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system under increasing perturbation when the NHIM loses its normal hyperbolicity. On one hand, we follow this decay in the Poincar\'e map for the internal dynamics of the NHIM. On the other hand, we also follow the decay in a time delay function calculated on a 2-dimensional plane in the phase space of the system. In addition, we observe the role of tangential transient effects on the decaying NHIM and their manifestation in the delay time indicator function. Thereby we obtain ideas on how the decay of NHIMs and the tangential transient effects are encoded in indicator functions. As an example of demonstration, we use the motion of an electron in a perturbed magnetic dipole field.</description>

      <title>Predicting two-dimensional spatiotemporal chaotic patterns with optimized high-dimensional hybrid reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an alternative approach for predicting complex dynamical systems where physics-based models are no longer reliable, reservoir computing (RC) has gained popularity. The hybrid approach is considered an interesting option for improving the prediction performance of RC. The idea is to combine a knowledge-based model (KBM) to support the fully data-driven RC prediction. There are three types of hybridization for RC, namely full hybrid (FH), input hybrid (IH) and output hybrid (OH), where it was shown that the latter one is superior in terms of the accuracy and the robustness for the prediction of low-dimensional chaotic systems. Here, we extend the formalism to the prediction of spatiotemporal patterns in two dimensions. To overcome the curse of dimensionality for this very high-dimensional case we employ the local states ansatz, where only a few locally adjacent time series are utilized for the RC-based prediction. Using simulation data from the Barkley model describing chaotic electrical wave propagation in cardiac tissue, we outline the formalism of high-dimensional hybrid RC and assess the performance of the different hybridization schemes. We find that all three methods (FH, IH and OH) perform better than reservoir only, where improvements are small when the model is very inaccurate. For small model errors and small reservoirs FH and OH perform nearly equally well and better than IH. Given the smaller CPU needs for OH and especially the better interpretability of it, OH is to be favored. For large reservoirs the performance of OH drops below that of FH and IH. Generally, it maybe advisable to test the three setups for a given application and select the best suited one that optimizes between the counteracting factors of prediction performance and CPU needs.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of Predator-Prey System using Conformable Fractional Order Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, conformal fractional order discretization [31, 35, 36] is used to analyze bifurcation analysis and stability of a predator-prey system. A continuous model has been discretized into a discrete one while preserving the fractional-order dynamics. This allows us to look more closely at the stability properties of the system and bifurcation phenomena, including period-doubling and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Through numerical and theoretical methods, this research investigated how the modification in system parameters affects the overall dynamics, which may have implications for ecological management and conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Response for Hyperbolic Systems by the fast adjoint response method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a uniformly hyperbolic system, we consider the problem of finding the optimal infinitesimal perturbation to apply to the system, from a certain set $P$ of feasible ones, to maximally increase the expectation of a given observation function. We perturb the system both by composing with a diffeomorphism near the identity or by adding a deterministic perturbation to the dynamics. In both cases, using the fast adjoint response formula, we show that the linear response operator, which associates the response of the expectation to the perturbation on the dynamics, is bounded in terms of the $C^{1,\alpha}$ norm of the perturbation. Under the assumption that $P$ is a strictly convex, closed subset of a Hilbert space $\cH$ that can be continuously mapped in the space of $C^3$ vector fields on our phase space, we show that there is a unique optimal perturbation in $P$ that maximizes the increase of the given observation function. Furthermore since the response operator is represented by a certain element $v$ of $\cH$, when the feasible set $P$ is the unit ball of $\cH$, the optimal perturbation is $v/||v||_{\cH}$. We also show how to compute the Fourier expansion $v$ in different cases. Our approach can work even on high dimensional systems. We demonstrate our method on numerical examples in dimensions 2, 3, and 21.</description>

      <title>An Analysis Framework for Understanding Deep Neural Networks Based on Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing artificial intelligence demands a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying deep learning. Here, we propose a straightforward analysis framework based on the dynamics of learning models. Neurons are categorized into two modes based on whether their transformation functions preserve order. This categorization reveals how deep neural networks (DNNs) maximize information extraction by rationally allocating the proportion of neurons in different modes across deep layers. We further introduce the attraction basins of the training samples in both the sample vector space and the weight vector space to characterize the generalization ability of DNNs. This framework allows us to identify optimal depth and width configurations, providing a unified explanation for fundamental DNN behaviors such as the "flat minima effect," "grokking," and double descent phenomena. Our analysis extends to networks with depths up to 100 layers.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-averaged mean-field many-body level density: an indicator of integrable versus chaotic single-particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the quantum chaos paradigm, the nature of a system's classical dynamics, whether integrable or chaotic, is universally reflected in the fluctuations of its quantum spectrum. However, since many-body spectra in the mean field limit are composed of independent single-particle energy levels, their spectral fluctuations always display Poissonian behavior and hence cannot be used to distinguish underlying chaotic from integrable single-particle dynamics. We demonstrate that this distinction can, instead, be revealed from the mean many-body level density (at fixed energy) and its variance after averaging over ensembles representing different types of single-particle dynamics. This is in strong contrast to the energy-averaged mean level density (of a given system) that is assumed not to carry such information and is routinely removed to focus on universal signatures. To support our claim we systematically analyze the role of single-particle level correlations, that enter through Poisson and random matrix statistics (of various symmetry classes) into the ensemble-averaged density of states and its variance, contrasting bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. Our analytical study, together with extensive numerical simulations for systems with $N \ge 5$ particles consistently reveal significant differences (up to an order of magnitude for fermions and even larger for bosons) in the mean many-body level densities, depending on the nature of the underlying dynamics. Notably, in the fermionic case Poisson-type single-particle level fluctuations precisely cancel contributions from indistinguishability, such that the average many-body spectral density equals the (Thomas-Fermi) volume term. We further highlight the difference between the mean level density and its variance as functions of the total energy $E$ and the excitation energy $Q$.</description>
