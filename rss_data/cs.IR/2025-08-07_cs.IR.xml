      <title>Augmented Question-guided Retrieval (AQgR) of Indian Case Law with LLM, RAG, and Structured Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying relevant legal precedents remains challenging, as most retrieval methods emphasize factual similarity over legal issues, and current systems often lack explanations clarifying case relevance. This paper proposes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this gap by facilitating the retrieval of relevant cases, generating explanations to elucidate relevance, and identifying core legal issues all autonomously, without requiring legal expertise. Our approach combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with structured summaries optimized for Indian case law. Leveraging the Augmented Question-guided Retrieval (AQgR) framework, the system generates targeted legal questions based on factual scenarios to identify relevant case law more effectively. The structured summaries were assessed manually by legal experts, given the absence of a suitable structured summary dataset. Case law retrieval was evaluated using the FIRE dataset, and explanations were reviewed by legal experts, as explanation generation alongside case retrieval is an emerging innovation. Experimental evaluation on a subset of the FIRE 2019 dataset yielded promising outcomes, achieving a Mean Average Precision (MAP) score of 0.36 and a Mean Average Recall (MAR) of 0.67 across test queries, significantly surpassing the current MAP benchmark of 0.1573. This work introduces a suite of novel contributions to advance case law retrieval. By transitioning from fact-based to legal-issue-based retrieval, the proposed approach delivers more contextually relevant results that align closely with legal professionals' needs. Integrating legal questions within the retrieval process through the AQgR framework ensures more precise and meaningful retrieval by refining the context of queries.</description>

      <title>Scaling Generative Recommendations with Context Parallelism on Hierarchical Sequential Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy, necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).</description>

      <title>A Metric for MLLM Alignment in Large-scale Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a critical technique in modern recommender systems, leveraging content representations from advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To ensure these representations are well-adapted, alignment with the recommender system is essential. However, evaluating the alignment of MLLMs for recommendation presents significant challenges due to three key issues: (1) static benchmarks are inaccurate because of the dynamism in real-world applications, (2) evaluations with online system, while accurate, are prohibitively expensive at scale, and (3) conventional metrics fail to provide actionable insights when learned representations underperform. To address these challenges, we propose the Leakage Impact Score (LIS), a novel metric for multimodal recommendation. Rather than directly assessing MLLMs, LIS efficiently measures the upper bound of preference data. We also share practical insights on deploying MLLMs with LIS in real-world scenarios. Online A/B tests on both Content Feed and Display Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing significant improvements in user spent time and advertiser value.</description>

      <title>Align-for-Fusion: Harmonizing Triple Preferences via Dual-oriented Diffusion for Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized sequential recommendation aims to predict appropriate items for users based on their behavioral sequences. To alleviate data sparsity and interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained triple-domain preference fusion.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Multi-objective Ensemble Ranking Framework for Video Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel End-to-end Multi-objective Ensemble Ranking framework (EMER) for the multi-objective ensemble ranking module, which is the most critical component of the short video recommendation system. EMER enhances personalization by replacing manually-designed heuristic formulas with an end-to-end modeling paradigm. EMER introduces a meticulously designed loss function to address the fundamental challenge of defining effective supervision for ensemble ranking, where no single ground-truth signal can fully capture user satisfaction. Moreover, EMER introduces novel sample organization method and transformer-based network architecture to capture the comparative relationships among candidates, which are critical for effective ranking. Additionally, we have proposed an offline-online consistent evaluation system to enhance the efficiency of offline model optimization, which is an established yet persistent challenge within the multi-objective ranking domain in industry. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. In addition, our framework has been deployed in the primary scenarios of Kuaishou, a short video recommendation platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users, achieving a 1.39% increase in overall App Stay Time and a 0.196% increase in 7-day user Lifetime(LT7), which are substantial improvements.</description>

      <title>Navigating Through Paper Flood: Advancing LLM-based Paper Evaluation through Domain-Aware Retrieval and Latent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers -- demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.</description>

      <title>Tool Graph Retriever: Exploring Dependency Graph-based Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently, overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval. First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.</description>

      <title>Balancing Accuracy and Novelty with Sub-Item Popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content, limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty. Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising recommendation accuracy.

      <title>FIRE: Faithful Interpretable Recommendation Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language explanations in recommender systems are often framed as a review generation task, leveraging user reviews as ground-truth supervision. While convenient, this approach conflates a user's opinion with the system's reasoning, leading to explanations that may be fluent but fail to reflect the true logic behind recommendations. In this work, we revisit the core objective of explainable recommendation: to transparently communicate why an item is recommended by linking user needs to relevant item features. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets, we identify common limitations-explanations that are weakly aligned with model predictions, vague or inaccurate in identifying user intents, and overly repetitive or generic. To overcome these challenges, we propose FIRE, a lightweight and interpretable framework that combines SHAP-based feature attribution with structured, prompt-driven language generation. FIRE produces faithful, diverse, and user-aligned explanations, grounded in the actual decision-making process of the model. Our results demonstrate that FIRE not only achieves competitive recommendation accuracy but also significantly improves explanation quality along critical dimensions such as alignment, structure, and faithfulness. This work highlights the need to move beyond the review-as-explanation paradigm and toward explanation methods that are both accountable and interpretable.</description>

      <title>Difference Views for Visual Graph Query Building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain vast amounts of linked resources that encode knowledge in various domains, which can be queried and searched for using specialized languages like SPARQL, a query language developed to query KGs. Existing visual query builders enable non-expert users to construct SPARQL queries and utilize the knowledge contained in these graphs. Query building is, however, an iterative and, often, visual process where the question of the user can change and differ throughout the process, especially for explorative search. Our visual querying interface communicates these change between iterative steps in the query building process using graph differences to contrast the changes and the evolution in the graph query. We also enable users to formulate their evolving information needs using a natural language interface directly integrated into the difference query view. We, furthermore, communicate the change in results in the result view by contrasting the differences in both result distribution and individual instances of the prototype graph and demonstrate the system's applicability through case studies on different ontologies and usage scenarios, illustrating how our system fosters, both, data exploration and analysis of domain-specific graphs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation with Conditional Diffusion-Based Feature Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation, aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2) the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR). This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data, thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Does Multimodality Improve Recommender Systems as Expected? A Critical Analysis and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly popular for their potential to improve performance by integrating diverse data types. However, the actual benefits of this integration remain unclear, raising questions about when and how it truly enhances recommendations. In this paper, we propose a structured evaluation framework to systematically assess multimodal recommendations across four dimensions: Comparative Efficiency, Recommendation Tasks, Recommendation Stages, and Multimodal Data Integration. We benchmark a set of reproducible multimodal models against strong traditional baselines and evaluate their performance on different platforms. Our findings show that multimodal data is particularly beneficial in sparse interaction scenarios and during the recall stage of recommendation pipelines. We also observe that the importance of each modality is task-specific, where text features are more useful in e-commerce and visual features are more effective in short-video recommendations. Additionally, we explore different integration strategies and model sizes, finding that Ensemble-Based Learning outperforms Fusion-Based Learning, and that larger models do not necessarily deliver better results. To deepen our understanding, we include case studies and review findings from other recommendation domains. Our work provides practical insights for building efficient and effective multimodal recommendation systems, emphasizing the need for thoughtful modality selection, integration strategies, and model design.</description>

      <title>On the Reliability of Sampling Strategies in Offline Recommender Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation. Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust offline comparisons.</description>

      <title>RankArena: A Unified Platform for Evaluating Retrieval, Reranking and RAG with Human and LLM Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and document reranking systems remains challenging due to the lack of scalable, user-centric, and multi-perspective evaluation tools. We introduce RankArena, a unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations. All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy selectors. Our platform is publicly available at https://rankarena.ngrok.io/, and the Demo video is provided https://youtu.be/jIYAP4PaSSI.</description>

      <title>KuaiLive: A Real-time Interactive Dataset for Live Streaming Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and highly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new challenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional recommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in recent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the lack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature of live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the first real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live streaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The dataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over a 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several advantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich side information features for both users and streamers. These features enable more realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation methods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive can support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware recommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at https://imgkkk574.github.io/KuaiLive.</description>

      <title>NAEx: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Explaining Network Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA models.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec) methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.</description>

      <title>Data-Aware Socratic Query Refinement in Database Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Data-Aware Socratic Guidance (DASG), a dialogue-based query enhancement framework that embeds \linebreak interactive clarification as a first-class operator within database systems to resolve ambiguity in natural language queries. DASG treats dialogue as an optimization decision, asking clarifying questions only when the expected execution cost reduction exceeds the interaction overhead. The system quantifies ambiguity through linguistic fuzziness, schema grounding confidence, and projected costs across relational and vector backends. Our algorithm selects the optimal clarifications by combining semantic relevance, catalog-based information gain, and potential cost reduction. We evaluate our proposed framework on three datasets. The results show that DASG demonstrates improved query precision while maintaining efficiency, establishing a cooperative analytics paradigm where systems actively participate in query formulation rather than passively translating user requests.</description>

      <title>Community-Aware Social Community Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social recommendation, which seeks to leverage social ties among users to alleviate the sparsity issue of user-item interactions, has emerged as a popular technique for elevating personalized services in recommender systems. Despite being effective, existing social recommendation models are mainly devised for recommending regular items such as blogs, images, and products, and largely fail for community recommendations due to overlooking the unique characteristics of communities. Distinctly, communities are constituted by individuals, who present high dynamicity and relate to rich structural patterns in social networks. To our knowledge, limited research has been devoted to comprehensively exploiting this information for recommending communities.
  To bridge this gap, this paper presents CASO, a novel and effective model specially designed for social community recommendation. Under the hood, CASO harnesses three carefully-crafted encoders for user embedding, wherein two of them extract community-related global and local structures from the social network via social modularity maximization and social closeness aggregation, while the third one captures user preferences using collaborative filtering with observed user-community affiliations. To further eliminate feature redundancy therein, we introduce a mutual exclusion between social and collaborative signals. Finally, CASO includes a community detection loss in the model optimization, thereby producing community-aware embeddings for communities. Our extensive experiments evaluating CASO against nine strong baselines on six real-world social networks demonstrate its consistent and remarkable superiority over the state of the art in terms of community recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Bidding-Aware Retrieval for Multi-Stage Consistency in Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness. Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals. Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.</description>

      <title>Mean-Variance Efficient Collaborative Filtering for Stock Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of FinTech has transformed financial services onto online platforms, yet stock investment recommender systems have received limited attention compared to other industries. Personalized stock recommendations can significantly impact customer engagement and satisfaction within the industry. However, traditional investment recommendations focus on high-return stocks or highly diversified portfolios based on the modern portfolio theory, often neglecting user preferences. On the other hand, collaborative filtering (CF) methods also may not be directly applicable to stock recommendations, because it is inappropriate to just recommend stocks that users like. The key is to optimally blend users preference with the portfolio theory. However, research on stock recommendations within the recommender system domain remains comparatively limited, and no existing model considers both the preference of users and the risk-return characteristics of stocks. In this regard, we propose a mean-variance efficient collaborative filtering (MVECF) model for stock recommendations that consider both aspects. Our model is specifically designed to improve the pareto optimality (mean-variance efficiency) in a trade-off between the risk (variance of return) and return (mean return) by systemically handling uncertainties in stock prices. Such improvements are incorporated into the MVECF model using regularization, and the model is restructured to fit into the ordinary matrix factorization scheme to boost computational efficiency. Experiments on real-world fund holdings data show that our model can increase the mean-variance efficiency of suggested portfolios while sacrificing just a small amount of mean average precision and recall. Finally, we further show MVECF is easily applicable to the state-of-the-art graph-based ranking models.</description>

      <title>Towards Personalized Conversational Sales Agents: Contextual User Profiling for Strategic Action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08754v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs)aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making, where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To capture this complexity, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSALES), a novel task that integrates preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion within a unified conversational framework. To support realistic and systematic evaluation, we present CSUSER, an evaluation protocol with LLM-based user simulator grounded in real-world behavioral data by modeling fine-grained user profiles for personalized interaction. We also propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual user profiles and strategically selects actions through conversation. Comprehensive experiments show that CSI significantly improves both recommendation success and persuasive effectiveness across diverse user profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in reasoning and question answering, yet their tendency to generate factually incorrect content remains a critical challenge. This study evaluates proprietary and open-source LLMs on generating relevant research papers with accurate arXiv links. Our evaluation reveals critical academic risks: LLMs frequently generate incorrect arXiv links or references to non-existent papers, fundamentally undermining their ability to properly attribute research contributions to the actual authors. We introduce arXivBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLM performance across eight major subject categories on arXiv and five subfields within computer science, one of the most popular categories among them. Our findings show concerning accuracy variations across subjects, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet exhibiting a substantial advantage in generating both relevant and accurate responses. Notably, most LLMs perform significantly better in Artificial Intelligence than other subfields. This benchmark provides a standardized tool for evaluating LLM reliability in scientific contexts, promoting more dependable academic use in research environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/liningresearch/arXivBench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/arXivBenchLLM/arXivBench.</description>

      <title>PinRec: Outcome-Conditioned, Multi-Token Generative Retrieval for Industry-Scale Recommendation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative retrieval methods utilize generative sequential modeling techniques, such as transformers, to generate candidate items for recommender systems. These methods have demonstrated promising results in academic benchmarks, surpassing traditional retrieval models like two-tower architectures. However, current generative retrieval methods lack the scalability required for industrial recommender systems, and they are insufficiently flexible to satisfy the multiple metric requirements of modern systems. This paper introduces PinRec, a novel generative retrieval model developed for applications at Pinterest. PinRec utilizes outcome-conditioned generation, enabling modelers to specify how to balance various outcome metrics, such as the number of saves and clicks, to effectively align with business goals and user exploration. Additionally, PinRec incorporates multi-token generation to enhance output diversity while optimizing generation. Our experiments demonstrate that PinRec can successfully balance performance, diversity, and efficiency, delivering a significant positive impact to users using generative models. This paper marks a significant milestone in generative retrieval, as it presents, to our knowledge, the first rigorous study on implementing generative retrieval at the scale of Pinterest.</description>

      <title>JEPA4Rec: Learning Effective Language Representations for Sequential Recommendation via Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language representation learning has emerged as a promising approach for sequential recommendation, thanks to its ability to learn generalizable representations. However, despite its advantages, this approach still struggles with data sparsity and a limited understanding of common-sense user preferences. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{JEPA4Rec}$, a framework that combines $\textbf{J}$oint $\textbf{E}$mbedding $\textbf{P}$redictive $\textbf{A}$rchitecture with language modeling of item textual descriptions. JEPA4Rec captures semantically rich and transferable representations, improving recommendation performance and reducing reliance on large-scale pre-training data. Specifically, JEPA4Rec represents items as text sentences by flattening descriptive information such as $\textit{title, category}$, and other attributes. To encode these sentences, we employ a bidirectional Transformer encoder with modified embedding layers tailored for capturing item information in recommendation datasets. We apply masking to text sentences and use them to predict the representations of the unmasked sentences, helping the model learn generalizable item embeddings. To further improve recommendation performance and language understanding, we employ a two-stage training strategy incorporating self-supervised learning losses. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that JEPA4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in cross-domain, cross-platform, and low-resource scenarios.</description>

      <title>Explainable Recommendation with Simulated Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in explainable recommendation have greatly bolstered user experience by elucidating the decision-making rationale. However, the existing methods actually fail to provide effective feedback signals for potentially better or worse generated explanations due to their reliance on traditional supervised learning paradigms in sparse interaction data. To address these issues, we propose a novel human-like feedback-driven optimization framework. This framework employs a dynamic interactive optimization mechanism for achieving human-centered explainable requirements without incurring high labor costs. Specifically, we propose to utilize large language models (LLMs) as human simulators to predict human-like feedback for guiding the learning process. To enable the LLMs to deeply understand the task essence and meet user's diverse personalized requirements, we introduce a human-induced customized reward scoring method, which helps stimulate the language understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, considering the potential conflicts between different perspectives of explanation quality, we introduce a principled Pareto optimization that transforms the multi-perspective quality enhancement task into a multi-objective optimization problem for improving explanation performance. At last, to achieve efficient model training, we design an off-policy optimization pipeline. By incorporating a replay buffer and addressing the data distribution biases, we can effectively improve data utilization and enhance model generality. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A private information retrieval (PIR) scheme is a protocol that allows a user to retrieve a file from a database without revealing the identity of the desired file to a curious database. Given a distributed data storage system, efficient PIR can be achieved by making assumptions about the colluding capabilities of the storage servers holding the database. If these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, privacy is lost. In this work, we focus on the worst-case assumption: full collusion or, equivalently, viewing the storage system virtually as a single honest-but-curious server. We present CB-cPIR, a single-server code-based computational private information retrieval (cPIR) scheme that derives security from code-based cryptography. Specifically, the queries are protected by the hardness of decoding a random linear code. The scheme is heavily inspired by the pioneering code-based cPIR scheme proposed by Holzbaur, Hollanti, and Wachter-Zeh in [Holzbaur et al., "Computational Code-Based Single-Server Private Information Retrieval", 2020 IEEE ISIT] and fixes the vulnerabilities of the original scheme arising from highly probable rank differences in submatrices of the user's query. Recently, a new vulnerability was observed in [Lage, Bartz, "On the Security of a Code-Based PIR Scheme"], a simple modification to the scheme now fixes this vulnerability. For further validation of our scheme, we draw comparisons to the state-of-the-art lattice-based cPIR schemes.</description>

Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios. Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task. Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training. Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline methods.</description>

      <title>From Generation to Consumption: Personalized List Value Estimation for Re-ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Re-ranking is critical in recommender systems for optimizing the order of recommendation lists, thus improving user satisfaction and platform revenue. Most existing methods follow a generator-evaluator paradigm, where the evaluator estimates the overall value of each candidate list. However, they often ignore the fact that users may exit before consuming the full list, leading to a mismatch between estimated generation value and actual consumption value. To bridge this gap, we propose CAVE, a personalized Consumption-Aware list Value Estimation framework. CAVE formulates the list value as the expectation over sub-list values, weighted by user-specific exit probabilities at each position. The exit probability is decomposed into an interest-driven component and a stochastic component, the latter modeled via a Weibull distribution to capture random external factors such as fatigue. By jointly modeling sub-list values and user exit behavior, CAVE yields a more faithful estimate of actual list consumption value. We further contribute three large-scale real-world list-wise benchmarks from the Kuaishou platform, varying in size and user activity patterns. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks, two Amazon datasets, and online A/B testing on Kuaishou show that CAVE consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the benefit of explicitly modeling user exits in re-ranking.</description>

      <title>Realizing Scaling Laws in Recommender Systems: A Foundation-Expert Paradigm for Hyperscale Model Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong, cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight, surface-specific "expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead. To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving, logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven, compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of scaling laws in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>KBest: Efficient Vector Search on Kunpeng CPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector search, which returns the vectors most similar to a given query vector from a large vector dataset, underlies many important applications such as search, recommendation, and LLMs. To be economic, vector search needs to be efficient to reduce the resources required by a given query workload. However, existing vector search libraries (e.g., Faiss and DiskANN) are optimized for x86 CPU architectures (i.e., Intel and AMD CPUs) while Huawei Kunpeng CPUs are based on the ARM architecture and competitive in compute power. In this paper, we present KBest as a vector search library tailored for the latest Kunpeng 920 CPUs. To be efficient, KBest incorporates extensive hardware-aware and algorithmic optimizations, which include single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) accelerated distance computation, data prefetch, index refinement, early termination, and vector quantization. Experiment results show that KBest outperforms SOTA vector search libraries running on x86 CPUs, and our optimizations can improve the query throughput by over 2x. Currently, KBest serves applications from both our internal business and external enterprise clients with tens of millions of queries on a daily basis.</description>

      <title>SSEmb: A Joint Structural and Semantic Embedding Framework for Mathematical Formula Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formula retrieval is an important topic in Mathematical Information Retrieval. We propose SSEmb, a novel embedding framework capable of capturing both structural and semantic features of mathematical formulas. Structurally, we employ Graph Contrastive Learning to encode formulas represented as Operator Graphs. To enhance structural diversity while preserving mathematical validity of these formula graphs, we introduce a novel graph data augmentation approach through a substitution strategy. Semantically, we utilize Sentence-BERT to encode the surrounding text of formulas. Finally, for each query and its candidates, structural and semantic similarities are calculated separately and then fused through a weighted scheme. In the ARQMath-3 formula retrieval task, SSEmb outperforms existing embedding-based methods by over 5 percentage points on P'@10 and nDCG'@10. Furthermore, SSEmb enhances the performance of all runs of other methods and achieves state-of-the-art results when combined with Approach0.</description>

      <title>QuMAB: Query-based Multi-Annotator Behavior Modeling with Reliability under Sparse Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-annotator learning traditionally aggregates diverse annotations to approximate a single ground truth, treating disagreements as noise. However, this paradigm faces fundamental challenges: subjective tasks often lack absolute ground truth, and sparse annotation coverage makes aggregation statistically unreliable. We introduce a paradigm shift from sample-wise aggregation to annotator-wise behavior modeling. By treating annotator disagreements as valuable information rather than noise, modeling annotator-specific behavior patterns can reconstruct unlabeled data to reduce annotation cost, enhance aggregation reliability, and explain annotator decision behavior. To this end, we propose QuMAB (Query-based Multi-Annotator Behavior Pattern Learning), which uses light-weight queries to model individual annotators while capturing inter-annotator correlations as implicit regularization, preventing overfitting to sparse individual data while maintaining individualization and improving generalization, with a visualization of annotator focus regions offering an explainable analysis of behavior understanding. We contribute two large-scale datasets with dense per-annotator labels: STREET (4,300 labels/annotator) and AMER (average 3,118 labels/annotator), the first multimodal multi-annotator dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our QuMAB in modeling individual annotators' behavior patterns, their utility for consensus prediction, and applicability under sparse annotations.</description>
