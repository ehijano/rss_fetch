      <title>Classifying extended, localized and critical states in quasiperiodic lattices via unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification of quantum phases is one of the most important areas of research in condensed matter physics. In this work, we obtain the phase diagram of one-dimensional quasiperiodic models via unsupervised learning. Firstly, we choose two advanced unsupervised learning algorithms, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS), to explore the distinct phases of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model and quasiperiodic p-wave model. The unsupervised learning results match well with traditional numerical diagonalization. Finally, we compare the similarity of different algorithms and find that the highest similarity between the results of unsupervised learning algorithms and those of traditional algorithms has exceeded 98\%. Our work sheds light on applications of unsupervised learning for phase classification.</description>

      <title>Amorphization-induced topological and insulator-metal transitions in bidimensional Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$ alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth has been shown to be topological in its different allotropes and compounds, with one of the most notable examples being the Bi-Sb alloy, the first 3D topological insulator ever discovered. In this paper we explore two-dimensional alloys of Bi and Sb, both crystalline and amorphous, to determine the critical concentrations that render the alloys topological. For the amorphous alloy, we determine the effect of structural disorder on its topological properties, remarkably observing a trivial to topological transition as disorder increases. The alloys are modelled using a Slater-Koster tight-binding model and the topological behaviour is assessed through the entanglement spectrum together with artificial neural networks. Additionally, we perform electronic transport calculations with results compatible with those of the entanglement spectrum, which, furthermore, reveal an insulator to metal transition in the highly disordered regime.</description>

      <title>Networks: The Visual Language of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origins of complexity is a fundamental challenge with implications for biological and technological systems. Network theory emerges as a powerful tool to model complex systems. Networks are an intuitive framework to represent inter-dependencies among many system components, facilitating the study of both local and global properties. However, it is unclear whether we can define a universal theoretical framework for evolving networks. While basic growth mechanisms, like preferential attachment, recapitulate common properties such as the power-law degree distribution, they fall short in capturing other system-specific properties. Tinkering, on the other hand, has shown to be very successful in generating modular or nested structures "for-free", highlighting the role of internal, non-adaptive mechanisms in the evolution of complexity. Different network extensions, like hypergraphs, have been recently developed to integrate exogenous factors in evolutionary models, as pairwise interactions are insufficient to capture environmentally-mediated species associations. As we confront global societal and climatic challenges, the study of network and hypergraphs provides valuable insights, emphasizing the importance of scientific exploration in understanding and managing complexity.</description>

      <title>Noise resilience in adaptive and symmetric monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits offer great perspectives for exploring the interplay of quantum information and complex quantum dynamics. These systems could realize the extensively studied entanglement and purification phase transitions, as well as a rich variety of symmetry-protected and ordered non-equilibrium phases. The central question regarding such phases is whether they survive in real-world devices exhibiting unavoidable symmetry-breaking noise. We study the fate of the symmetry-protected absorbing state and charge-sharpening transitions in the presence of symmetry-breaking noise, and establish that the net effect of noise results in coherent and incoherent symmetry-breaking effects. The coherent contribution removes a sharp distinction between different phases and renders phase transitions to crossovers. Nevertheless, states far away from the original phase boundaries retain their essential character. In fact, corrective feedback in adaptive quantum circuits and postselected measurements in symmetric charge-conserving quantum circuits can suppress the effects of noise, thereby stabilizing the absorbing and charge-sharp phases, respectively. Despite the unavoidable noise in current quantum hardwares, our findings offer an optimistic outlook for observing symmetry-protected phases in currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Moreover, our work suggests a symmetry-based benchmarking method as an alternative for characterizing noise and evaluating average local gate fidelity.</description>

      <title>Emerging quantum critical phase in a cluster spin-glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic frustration has been recognized as pivotal to investigating new phases of matter in correlation-driven Kondo breakdown quantum phase transitions that are not clearly associated with broken symmetry. The nature of these new phases, however, remains underexplored. Here, we report quantum criticalities emerging from a cluster spin-glass in the heavy-fermion metal TiFe$_x$Cu$_{2x-1}$Sb, where frustration originates from intrinsic disorder. Specific heat and magnetic Gr\"uneisen parameter measurements under varying magnetic fields exhibit quantum critical scaling, indicating a quantum critical point near 0.13 Tesla. As the magnetic field increases, the cluster spin-glass phase is progressively suppressed. Upon crossing the quantum critical point, resistivity and Hall effect measurements reveal enhanced screening of local moments and an expanding Fermi surface, consistent with the Kondo breakdown scenario.</description>

      <title>On the Replica Symmetric Solution in General Diluted Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unifying approach to studying the replica symmetric solution in general diluted spin glass models on random $p$-uniform hypergraphs with sparsity parameter $\alpha$. Our result shows that there exist two key regimes in which the model exhibits replica symmetry and the free energy can be explicitly represented as the evaluation of an energy functional at the unique fixed point of a recursive distributional equation. One is called the high temperature regime, where the temperature and the sparsity parameter are essentially inversely proportional to each other; the other is the subcritical regime defined as $\alpha p (p-1)\leq 1$. In particular, the fact that the second regime is independent of the temperature parameter further allows us to deduce an analogous representation of the ground state energy in the subcritical regime. Along the way, we revisit several well-known formulas and also derive new ones for the free and ground state energies in the constraint satisfaction problem, Potts model, XY model, and continuous hardcore model.</description>

      <title>Active Inhomogeneous Mode-Coupling Theory (aIMCT) for Dense Systems of Self-Propelled Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy dynamics in a dense system of active particles with self-propulsion force $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ are crucial for many biological processes. Recent studies have shown that, unlike relaxation dynamics, dynamic heterogeneity (DH) in active glasses exhibits nontrivial behavior. However, the mechanism by which activity affects DH remains unknown. We have developed an active inhomogeneous mode-coupling theory (aIMCT) for DH in active glasses. We show that the nontrivial behavior of DH comes from a novel nonequilibrium effect of activity that leads to distinct behaviors of DH and relaxation dynamics in active glasses. When activity is small, DH exhibits equilibrium-like behavior with a power-law divergence of the peak height of the four-point correlation function, $\chi_C^\text{peak}$, and the aIMCT value of the exponent, $\mu\simeq 1.0$, is consistent with the existing and our new simulations of active glasses. However, $\chi_C^\text{peak}$ deviates from the scaling relations at higher $f_0$ values because of the novel effect on DH, although the deviation with varying $\tau_p$ is relatively weak.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of Regularization in Adversarial Training: High-Dimensional Asymptotics and Generalization Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularization, whether explicit in terms of a penalty in the loss or implicit in the choice of algorithm, is a cornerstone of modern machine learning. Indeed, controlling the complexity of the model class is particularly important when data is scarce, noisy or contaminated, as it translates a statistical belief on the underlying structure of the data. This work investigates the question of how to choose the regularization norm $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ in the context of high-dimensional adversarial training for binary classification. To this end, we first derive an exact asymptotic description of the robust, regularized empirical risk minimizer for various types of adversarial attacks and regularization norms (including non-$\ell_p$ norms). We complement this analysis with a uniform convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the Rademacher Complexity for this class of problems. Leveraging our theoretical results, we quantitatively characterize the relationship between perturbation size and the optimal choice of $\lVert \cdot \rVert$, confirming the intuition that, in the data scarce regime, the type of regularization becomes increasingly important for adversarial training as perturbations grow in size.</description>

      <title>Modelling Structured Data Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines in the Teacher-Student Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) are generative models capable to learn data with a rich underlying structure. We study the teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns structured data generated by a teacher RBM. The amount of structure in the data is controlled by adjusting the number of hidden units of the teacher and the correlations in the rows of the weights, a.k.a. patterns. In the absence of correlations, we validate the conjecture that the performance is independent of the number of teacher patters and hidden units of the student RBMs, and we argue that the teacher-student setting can be used as a toy model for studying the lottery ticket hypothesis. Beyond this regime, we find that the critical amount of data required to learn the teacher patterns decreases with both their number and correlations. In both regimes, we find that, even with an relatively large dataset, it becomes impossible to learn the teacher patterns if the inference temperature used for regularization is kept too low. In our framework, the student can learn teacher patterns one-to-one or many-to-one, generalizing previous findings about the teacher-student setting with two hidden units to any arbitrary finite number of hidden units.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems leading to a universal description of the nature of information dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains, we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain. More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric transfer matrix analysis of Lyapunov exponents in one-dimensional non-reciprocal quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyapunov exponent, serving as an indicator of the localized state, is commonly utilized to identify localization transitions in disordered systems. In non-Hermitian quasicrystals, the non-Hermitian effect induced by non-reciprocal hopping can lead to the manifestation of two distinct Lyapunov exponents on opposite sides of the localization center. Building on this observation, we here introduce a comprehensive approach for examining the localization characteristics and mobility edges of non-reciprocal quasicrystals, referred to as asymmetric transfer matrix analysis. We demonstrate the application of this method to three specific scenarios: the non-reciprocal Aubry-Andr\'e model, the non-reciprocal off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e model, and the non-reciprocal mosaic quasicrystals. This work may contribute valuable insights to the investigation of non-Hermitian quasicrystal and disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized hetero-associative neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auto-associative neural networks (e.g., the Hopfield model implementing the standard Hebbian prescription) serve as a foundational framework for pattern recognition and associative memory in statistical mechanics. However, their hetero-associative counterparts, though less explored, exhibit even richer computational capabilities. In this work, we examine a straightforward extension of Kosko's Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM), introducing a Three-directional Associative Memory (TAM), that is a tripartite neural network equipped with generalized Hebbian weights. Through both analytical approaches (using replica-symmetric statistical mechanics) and computational methods (via Monte Carlo simulations), we derive phase diagrams within the space of control parameters, revealing a region where the network can successfully perform pattern recognition as well as other tasks tasks. In particular, it can achieve pattern disentanglement, namely, when presented with a mixture of patterns, the network can recover the original patterns. Furthermore, the system is capable of retrieving Markovian sequences of patterns and performing generalized frequency modulation.</description>

      <title>Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</description>

Abstract: We consider an inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph ensemble with exponentially decaying random disconnection probabilities determined by an i.i.d. field of variables with heavy tails and infinite mean associated to the vertices of the graph. This model was recently investigated in the physics literature in Garuccio et al. (2020) as a scale-invariant random graph within the context of network renormalization. From a mathematical perspective, the model fits in the class of scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs whose asymptotic geometrical features have been recently attracting interest. While for this type of graphs several results are known when the underlying vertex variables have finite mean and variance, here instead we consider the case of one-sided stable variables with necessarily infinite mean. To simplify our analysis, we assume that the variables are sampled from a Pareto distribution with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1)$. We start by characterizing the asymptotic distributions of the typical degrees and some related observables. In particular, we show that the degree of a vertex converges in distribution, after proper scaling, to a mixed Poisson law. We then show that correlations among degrees of different vertices are asymptotically non-vanishing, but at the same time a form of asymptotic tail independence is found when looking at the behavior of the joint Laplace transform around zero. Moreover, we present some findings concerning the asymptotic density of wedges and triangles and show a cross-over for the existence of dust (i.e. disconnected vertices).</description>

      <title>Multiscale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Inverse Design of Finite-Size Hyperuniform Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse retrieval of the spatially inhomogeneous effective permittivity and for the homogenization of finite-size photonic media with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs can capture the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inversely retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we numerically corroborate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. The flexible multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of more general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in monitored single-particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multifractal properties in time evolution of a single particle subject to repeated measurements. For quantum systems, we consider circuit models consisting of local unitary gates and local projective measurements. For classical systems, we consider models for estimating the trajectory of a particle evolved under local transition processes by partially measuring particle occupations. In both cases, multifractal behaviors appear in the ensemble of wave functions or probability distributions conditioned on measurement outcomes after a sufficiently long time. While the nature of particle transport (diffusive or ballistic) qualitatively affects the multifractal properties, they are even quantitatively robust to the measurement rate or specific protocols. On the other hand, multifractality is generically lost by generalized measurements allowing erroneous outcomes or by postselection of the outcomes with no particle detection. We demonstrate these properties by numerical simulations and also propose several simplified models, which allow us to analytically obtain multifractal properties in the monitored single-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Brain functions emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the connectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped by the brain's structural organization. However, the theoretical principles explaining how this physical architecture governs its function remain elusive. Here, we propose an algebraic quantum mechanics (AQM) framework in which the functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system defined on the underlying directed multigraph. These equilibrium states, derived from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states formalism, capture the contribution of each neuron to the overall information flow. We apply this framework to the connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, providing a detailed description of the KMS states, exploring their functional implications, and predicting functional networks based on anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, our approach reveals functional circuits predicted by the topology of the connectome and illuminates on the mechanisms linking structure to function.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gap ratios of singular values in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding open quantum systems using information encoded in its complex eigenvalues has been a subject of growing interest. In this paper, we study higher-order gap ratios of the singular values of generic open quantum systems. We show that $k$-th order gap ratio of the singular values of an open quantum system can be connected to the nearest-neighbor spacing ratio of positions of classical particles of a harmonically confined log-gas with inverse temperature $\beta'(k)$ where $\beta'(k)$ is an analytical function that depends on $k$ and the Dyson's index $\beta=1,2,$ and $4$ that characterizes the properties of the associated Hermitized matrix. Our findings are crucial not only for understanding long-range correlations between the eigenvalues but also provide an excellent way of distinguishing different symmetry classes in an open quantum system. To highlight the universality of our findings, we demonstrate the higher-order gap ratios using different platforms such as non-Hermitian random matrices, random dissipative Liouvillians, Hamiltonians coupled to a Markovian bath, and Hamiltonians with in-built non-Hermiticity.</description>
