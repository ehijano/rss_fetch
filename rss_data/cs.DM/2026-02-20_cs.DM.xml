      <title>Partial Optimality in the Preordering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preordering is a generalization of clustering and partial ordering with applications in bioinformatics and social network analysis. Given a finite set $V$ and a value $c_{ab} \in \mathbb{R}$ for every ordered pair $ab$ of elements of $V$, the preordering problem asks for a preorder $\lesssim$ on $V$ that maximizes the sum of the values of those pairs $ab$ for which $a \lesssim b$. Building on the state of the art in solving this NP-hard problem partially, we contribute new partial optimality conditions and efficient algorithms for deciding these conditions. In experiments with real and synthetic data, these new conditions increase, in particular, the fraction of pairs $ab$ for which it is decided efficiently that $a \not\lesssim b$ in an optimal preorder.</description>

      <title>Distributed $(\Delta+1)$-Coloring in Graphs of Bounded Neighborhood Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distributed coloring problem is arguably one of the key problems studied in the area of distributed graph algorithms. The most standard variant of the problem asks for a proper vertex coloring of a graph with $\Delta+1$ colors, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Despite an immense amount of work on distributed coloring problems in the distributed setting, determining the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring in the standard message passing model remains one of the most important open questions of the area. In this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring as a function of $\Delta$ in a special family of graphs for which significantly faster algorithms are already known. The neighborhood independence $\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise non-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. In general, in graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta=O(1)$ (e.g., line graphs), it is known that $(\Delta+1)$-coloring can be solved in $2^{O(\sqrt{\log\Delta})}+O(\log^* n)$ rounds. In the present paper, we significantly improve this result, and we show that in graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta$, a $(\Delta+1)$-coloring can be computed in $(\theta\cdot\log\Delta)^{O(\log\log\Delta / \log\log\log\Delta)}+O(\log^* n)$ rounds and thus in quasipolylogarithmic time in $\Delta$ as long as $\theta$ is at most polylogarithmic in $\Delta$. We also show that the known approach that leads to a polylogarithmic in $\Delta$ algorithm for $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring already fails for edge colorings of hypergraphs of rank at least $3$.</description>

      <title>Improved Upper Bounds for Slicing the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A collection of hyperplanes $\mathcal{H}$ slices all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $\{-1,1\}^n$ if, for every edge $e$ in the hypercube, there exists a hyperplane in $\mathcal{H}$ intersecting $e$ in its interior. Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \leq \frac{4n}{5} +1$. This improves upon the previously known upper bound of $S(n) \leq \lceil\frac{5n}{6} \rceil$ due to Paterson reported in 1971. We also obtain new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in $Q_n$ that can be sliced using $k&lt;n$ hyperplanes. We prove the improved upper bound on $S(n)$ by constructing $8$ hyperplanes slicing $Q_{10}$ aided by the recently introduced CPro1: an automatic tool that uses reasoning LLMs coupled with automated hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for the discovery of mathematical constructions.</description>

      <title>Canonical labelling of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that whenever $d=d(n)\to\infty$ and $n-d\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$, then with high probability for any non-trivial initial colouring, the colour refinement algorithm distinguishes all vertices of the random regular graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$. This, in particular, implies that with high probability $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$ admits a canonical labelling computable in time $O(\min\{n^{\omega},nd^2+nd\log n\})$, where $\omega&lt;2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.</description>

      <title>On Sets of Monochromatic Objects in Bicolored Point Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane, not all on a line, each colored \emph{red} or \emph{blue}. The classical Motzkin--Rabin theorem guarantees the existence of a \emph{monochromatic} line. Motivated by the seminal work of Green and Tao (2013) on the Sylvester-Gallai theorem, we investigate the quantitative and structural properties of monochromatic geometric objects, such as lines, circles, and conics.
  We first show that if no line contains more than three points, then for all sufficiently large $n$ there are at least $n^{2}/24 - O(1)$ monochromatic lines. We then show a converse of a theorem of Jamison (1986): Given $n\ge 6$ blue points and $n$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all red points are collinear. We also settle the smallest nontrivial case of a conjecture of Mili\'cevi\'c (2018) by showing that if we have $5$ blue points with no three collinear and $5$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all $10$ points lie on a cubic curve. Further, we analyze the random setting and show that, for any non-collinear set of $n\ge 10$ points independently colored red or blue, the expected number of monochromatic lines is minimized by the \emph{near-pencil} configuration. Finally, we examine monochromatic circles and conics, and exhibit several natural families in which no such monochromatic objects exist.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Homomorphism Reconstruction Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the algorithmic problem of reconstructing a graph from homomorphism counts that has first been studied in (B\"oker et al., STACS 2024): given graphs $F_1,\ldots,F_k$ and counts $m_1,\ldots,m_k$, decide if there is a graph $G$ such that the number of homomorphisms from $F_i$ to $G$ is $m_i$, for all $i$. We prove that the problem is NEXP-hard if the counts $m_i$ are specified in binary and $\Sigma_2^p$-complete if they are in unary. Furthermore, as a positive result, we show that the unary version can be solved in polynomial time if the constraint graphs are stars of bounded size.</description>

      <title>On the existence of factors intersecting sets of cycles in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent result by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a and Zerafa [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 160 (2023) 1--14] related to the famous Berge-Fulkerson conjecture implies that given an arbitrary set of odd pairwise edge-disjoint cycles, say $\mathcal O$, in a bridgeless cubic graph, there exists a $1$-factor intersecting all cycles in $\mathcal O$ in at least one edge. This remarkable result opens up natural generalizations in the case of an $r$-regular graph $G$ and a $t$-factor $F$, with $r$ and $t$ being positive integers. In this paper, we start the study of this problem by proving necessary and sufficient conditions on $G$, $t$ and $r$ to assure the existence of a suitable $F$ for any possible choice of the set $\mathcal O$. First of all, we show that $G$ needs to be $2$-connected. Under this additional assumption, we highlight how the ratio $\frac{t}{r}$ seems to play a crucial role in assuring the existence of a $t$-factor $F$ with the required properties by proving that $\frac{t}{r} \geq \frac{1}{3}$ is a further necessary condition. We suspect that this condition is also sufficient, and we confirm it in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{3}$, generalizing the case $t=1$ and $r=3$ proved by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a, Zerafa, and in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{2}$ with $t$ even. Finally, we provide further results for the case where even cycles are included.</description>

      <title>Finding Minimum Matching Cuts in $H$-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A matching cut is a matching that is also an edge cut. In the problem Minimum Matching Cut, we ask for a matching cut with the minimum number of edges in the matching. We investigate the differences in complexity between Minimum Matching Cut, its counterpart Maximum Matching Cut, and the decision problem Matching Cut. Our polynomial-time algorithms for $P_8$-free, $S_{1,1,3}$-free and $(P_6 + P_4)$-free graphs extend the cases where Minimum Matching Cut and Maximum Matching Cut are known to differ in complexity. In addition, they solve open cases for the well-studied problem Matching Cut. The NP-hardness proof for $3P_3$-free graphs implies that Minimum Matching Cut and Matching Cut, which is polynomial-time solvable even for $sP_3$-free graphs, for any $s \geq 1$, differ in complexity on certain graph classes. Further, we give complexity dichotomies for both general and bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter.</description>

      <title>Stigmergic Swarming Agents for Fast Subgraph Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum partial subgraph isomorphism compares two graphs (nodes joined by edges) to find a largest common subgraph. A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and na\"ive solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size. ASSIST can be extended to support matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.</description>
