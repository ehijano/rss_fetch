      <title>A Nitrogen Alternative: Use of Plasma Activated Water as Nitrogen Source in Hydroponic Solution for Radish Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates the potential of Plasma-Activated Water (PAW) as a nitrogen supplement in hydroponic cultivation (HS-N+PAW), specifically focusing on radish seed germination and plant growth. PAW, produced using a dielectric barrier discharge pencil plasma jet using air as plasma forming gas, is compared against conventional hydroponic solution (HS) and hydroponic solution without nitrogen (HS-N). PAW treatment completely eliminates microbial growth in seeds. Radish plants cultivated with HS-N+PAW display approximately 30% and 3% longer roots compared to those grown with HS-N and HS, respectively, with shoot length increasing by ~16.5% (HS-N) and &lt;1% (HS). Root weight sees a substantial increase of ~51% with HS-N+PAW compared to HS-N, while the increase with HS is not significant. Similarly, shoot fresh weight sees a notable increase of 50% (HS-N) and 10% (HS). In terms of biochemical composition, radish roots show a significant increase of approximately 15.3% in soluble sugar concentration with HS-N+PAW compared to HS-N. Protein concentration in radish leaves increases by ~5.1% and ~19.0% with HS-N+PAW compared to HS-N and HS, respectively. Heightened soluble sugar and protein concentrations in HS-N+PAW-grown plants, indicating enhanced metabolic activity and nutrient uptake. However, variations in chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations in leaves among different growth media are statistically insignificant. H2O2 concentration root and shoot remains consistent across growth media, electrolytic and phenolic leakage, along with antioxidant enzyme activities, exhibit differential responses, underscoring the impact of growth conditions on plant stress responses.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Performance and Turbulence in ITER Burning Plasmas via Nonlinear Gyrokinetic Profile Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burning plasma performance, transport, and the effect of hydrogen isotope on confinement has been predicted for ITER baseline scenario (IBS) conditions using nonlinear gyrokinetic profile predictions. Accelerated by surrogate modeling [P. Rodriguez-Fernandez NF 2022], high fidelity, nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations performed with the CGYRO code [J. Candy JCP 2016], were used to predict profiles of Ti, Te, and ne while including the effects of alpha heating, auxiliary power, collisional energy exchange, and radiation losses. Predicted profiles and resulting energy confinement are found to produce fusion power and gain that are approximately consistent with mission goals (Pfusion = 500MW at Q=10) for the baseline scenario and exhibit energy confinement that is within 1 sigma of the H-mode energy confinement scaling. The power of the surrogate modeling technique is demonstrated through the prediction of alternative ITER scenarios with reduced computational cost. These scenarios include conditions with maximized fusion gain and an investigation of potential Resonant Magnetic Perturbation effects on performance with a minimal number of gyrokinetic profile iterations required. These predictions highlight the stiff ITG nature of the core turbulence predicted in the ITER baseline and demonstrate that Q&gt;17 conditions may be accessible by reducing auxiliary input power while operating in IBS conditions. Prediction of full kinetic profiles allowed for the projection of hydrogen isotope effects around ITER baseline conditions. The gyrokinetic fuel ion species was varied from H, D, and 50/50 D-T and kinetic profiles were predicted. Results indicate that a weak or negligible isotope effect will be observed to arise from core turbulence in ITER baseline scenario conditions. The resulting energy confinement, turbulence, and density peaking, and the implications for ITER operations will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Statistical theory of the broadband two plasmon decay instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is renewed interest in direct-drive inertial confinement fusion, following the milestone December 2022 3.15 MJ ignition result on the National Ignition Facility. A key obstacle is the control of the two plasmon decay instability. Here, recent advances in inhomogeneous turbulence theory are applied to the broadband parametric instability problem for the first time. A novel dispersion relation is derived for the two plasmon decay in a uniform plasma valid under broad-bandwidth laser fields with arbitrary power spectra. The effects of temporal incoherence on the instability are then studied. In the limit of large bandwidth, the well-known scaling relations for the growth rate are recovered, but it is shown that the result is more sensitive to the spectral shape of the laser pulse rather than to its coherence time. The range of wavenumbers of the excited plasma waves is shown to be substantially broadened, suggesting that the absolute instability is favoured in regions further away from the quarter critical density. The intermediate bandwidth regime is explored numerically -- the growth rate is reduced to half its monochromatic value for laser intensities of $10^{15} \, \text{W}/\text{cm}^{2}$ and relatively modest bandwidths of $5 \, \text{THz}$. The instability-quenching properties of a spectrum of discrete lines spread over some bandwidth have also been studied. The reduction in the growth rate is found to be somewhat lower compared to the continuous case but is still significant, despite the fact that, formally, the coherence time of such a laser pulse is infinite.</description>

      <title>A quasi-linear model of electromagnetic turbulent transport and its application to flux-driven transport predictions for STEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-linear reduced transport model is developed from a database of high-$\beta$ electromagnetic nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations performed with Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) relevant parameters. The quasi-linear model is fully electromagnetic and accounts for the effect of equilibrium flow shear using a novel approach. Its flux predictions are shown to agree quantitatively with predictions from local nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations across a broad range of STEP-relevant local equilibria. This reduced transport model is implemented in the T3D transport solver that is used to perform the first flux-driven simulations for STEP to account for transport from hybrid-KBM turbulence, which dominates over a wide region of the core plasma. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of the final transport steady state from T3D return turbulent fluxes that are consistent with the reduced model, indicating that the quasi-linear model may also be appropriate for describing the transport steady state. Within the assumption considered here, our simulations support the existence of a transport steady state in STEP with a fusion power comparable to that in the burning flat-top of the conceptual design, but do not demonstrate how this state can be accessed.</description>

      <title>Application of Lagrangian techniques for calculating the on-axis rotational transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Floquet exponents of periodic field lines are studied through the variations of the magnetic action on the magnetic axis, which is assumed to be elliptical. The near-axis formalism developed by Mercier, Solov'ev and Shafranov is combined with a Lagrangian approach. The on-axis Floquet exponent is shown to coincide with the on-axis rotational transform, and this is a coordinate-independent result. A discrete solution suitable for numerical implementation is introduced, which gives the Floquet exponents as solutions to an eigenvalue problem. This discrete formalism expresses the exponents as the eigenvalues of a $6\times 6$ matrix.</description>

      <title>FTL: Transfer Learning Nonlinear Plasma Dynamic Transitions in Low Dimensional Embeddings via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms provide a new paradigm to study high-dimensional dynamical behaviors, such as those in fusion plasma systems. Development of novel model reduction methods, coupled with detection of abnormal modes with plasma physics, opens a unique opportunity for building efficient models to identify plasma instabilities for real-time control. Our Fusion Transfer Learning (FTL) model demonstrates success in reconstructing nonlinear kink mode structures by learning from a limited amount of nonlinear simulation data. The knowledge transfer process leverages a pre-trained neural encoder-decoder network, initially trained on linear simulations, to effectively capture nonlinear dynamics. The low-dimensional embeddings extract the coherent structures of interest, while preserving the inherent dynamics of the complex system. Experimental results highlight FTL's capacity to capture transitional behaviors and dynamical features in plasma dynamics -- a task often challenging for conventional methods. The model developed in this study is generalizable and can be extended broadly through transfer learning to address various magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) modes.</description>

      <title>(Sub-)picosecond surface correlations of femtosecond laser excited Al-coated multilayers observed by grazing-incidence x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond high-intensity laser pulses at intensities surpassing $10^{14} \,\text{W}/\text{cm}^2$ can generate a diverse range of functional surface nanostructures. Achieving precise control over the production of these functional structures necessitates a thorough understanding of the surface morphology dynamics with nanometer-scale spatial resolution and picosecond-scale temporal resolution. In this study, we show that individual XFEL pulses can elucidate structural changes on surfaces induced by laser-generated plasmas, employing grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS). Using aluminum-coated multilayer samples we can differentiate between ultrafast surface morphology dynamics and subsequent subsurface density dynamics, achieving nanometer-depth sensitivity and subpicosecond temporal resolution. The observed subsurface density dynamics serve to validate advanced simulation models depicting matter under extreme conditions. Our findings promise to unveil novel avenues for laser material nanoprocessing and high-energy-density science.</description>

      <title>A globally conservative finite element MHD code and its application to the study of compact torus formation, levitation and magnetic compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.13283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DELiTE (Differential Equations on Linear Triangular Elements) framework was developed for spatial discretisation of partial differential equations on an unstructured triangular grid in axisymmetric geometry. The framework is based on discrete differential operators in matrix form, which are derived using linear finite elements and mimic some of the properties of their continuous counterparts. A single-fluid two-temperature MHD code is implemented in this framework. The inherent properties of the operators are used in the code to ensure global conservation of energy, particle count, toroidal flux, and angular momentum. The code was applied to study a novel experiment in which a compact torus (CT), produced with a magnetized Marshall gun, is magnetically levitated off an insulating wall and then magnetically compressed through the action of currents in the levitation/compression coils located outside the wall. We present numerical models for CT formation, levitation, and magnetic compression, and comparisons between simulated and experimental diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Metastability of stratified magnetohydrostatic equilibria and their relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by explosive releases of energy in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas, we consider the nonlinear stability of stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria against interchanges of straight magnetic-flux tubes. We demonstrate that in MHD (unlike in hydrodynamics) linear stability does not guarantee nonlinear stability, even in this simple case. We show that the minimum-energy configurations attainable by metastable equilibria under non-diffusive 2D dynamics can be determined by solving a combinatorial optimization problem. These minimum-energy states are, to good approximation, the final states reached by simulations of destabilized metastable equilibria where turbulent mixing is suppressed by viscosity. For the case of fully turbulent relaxation, we construct a statistical mechanical theory based on the maximization of Boltzmann's mixing entropy. This theory is analogous to the Lynden-Bell statistical mechanics of stellar systems and collisionless plasmas and to the Robert-Sommeria-Miller (RSM) theory of 2D vortex turbulence. Our theory reproduces well the results of our numerical simulations for sufficiently large perturbations to the metastable equilibrium.</description>
