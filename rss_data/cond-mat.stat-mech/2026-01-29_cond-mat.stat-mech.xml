      <title>Tuning the strength of emergent correlations in a Brownian gas via batch resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a gas of $N$ diffusing particles on the line subject to batch resetting: at rate $r$, a uniformly random subset of $m$ particles is reset to the origin. Despite the absence of interactions, the dynamics generates a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range correlations. We obtain exact results, both for the NESS and for the time dependence of the correlations, which are valid for arbitrary $m$ and $N$. By varying $m$, the system interpolates between an uncorrelated regime ($m=1$) and the fully synchronous resetting case ($m=N$). For all $1&lt;m&lt;N$, correlations exhibit a non-monotonic time dependence due to the emergence of an intrinsic decorrelation mechanism. In the stationary state, the correlation strength can be tuned by varying $m$, and it displays a transition at a critical value $N_c=6$. Our predictions extend straightforwardly to any spatial dimension $d$ and the critical value $N_c=6$ remains the same in all dimensions. Our predictions are testable in existing experimental setups on optically trapped colloidal particles.</description>

      <title>First-Hitting Location Laws as Boundary Observables of Drift--Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate first-hitting location (FHL) statistics induced by drift--diffusion processes in domains with absorbing boundaries, and examine how such boundary laws give rise to intrinsic information observables. Rather than introducing explicit encoding or decoding mechanisms, information is viewed as emerging directly from the geometry and dynamics of stochastic transport through first-passage events. Treating the FHL as the primary observable, we characterize how geometry and drift jointly shape the induced boundary measure. In diffusion-dominated regimes, the exit law exhibits scale-free, heavy-tailed spatial fluctuations along the boundary, whereas a nonzero drift component introduces an intrinsic length scale that suppresses these tails and reorganizes the exit statistics. Within a generator-based formulation, the FHL arises naturally as a boundary measure induced by an elliptic operator, allowing explicit boundary kernels to be derived analytically in canonical geometries. Planar absorbing boundaries in different ambient dimensions are examined as benchmark cases, illustrating how directed transport regularizes diffusion-driven fluctuations and induces qualitative transitions in boundary statistics. Overall, the present work provides a unified structural framework for first-hitting location laws and highlights FHL statistics as natural probes of geometry, drift, and irreversibility in stochastic transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in the criticality of open quantum many-body systems, we study nonlinear sigma models with complexified couplings as a general framework for nonunitary field theory. Applying the perturbative renormalization-group analysis to the tenfold symmetric spaces, we demonstrate that fixed points with complex scaling dimensions and critical exponents arise generically, without counterparts in conventional nonlinear sigma models with real couplings. We further clarify the global phase diagrams in the complex-coupling plane and identify both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions. Our work elucidates universal aspects of critical phenomena in complexified field theory.</description>

      <title>On the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in the limit of integer spacetime dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wilson-Fisher fixed point defines a continuous family of interacting conformal field theories in non-integer dimensions. In integer dimensions, it is widely believed to lie in the same universality class as the critical Ising model. In this work, we revisit the identification between the Wilson-Fisher fixed point at integer dimensions and the Ising CFT. We argue that a literal equality between the two theories is incompatible with the emergence of Virasoro symmetry in two dimensions. Instead, we propose that the Ising model emerges only as a subsector of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We support this scenario through a detailed study of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ model and by examining operators transforming in irreducible representations of the orthogonal group whose multiplicities become negative for integer values of the spacetime dimension. Finally, we comment on the implications of these results for attempts to construct a $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion starting from exact two-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Signatures of Ergodicity and Spectral Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate timelike entanglement measures derived from the spacetime density kernel in the Rosenzweig-Porter model and show that they sharply diagnose both eigenvector ergodicity and spectral chaos. For several Hilbert-space bipartitions, we compute the second Tsallis entropy, the entanglement imagitivity that quantifies non-Hermiticity, and Schatten-norm diagnostics of the kernel. The imagitivity and Frobenius norm exhibit rapid growth and high late-time plateaus in the ergodic regime, are suppressed in the localized regime, and show intermediate behavior in the fractal phase. The real part of the second Tsallis entropy displays a spectral form factor-like dip-ramp-plateau throughout the chaotic window and a suppressed ramp in the localized regime. We further introduce a kernel negativity, defined as the negative spectral weight of the Hermitian part of the kernel. This negativity equals the trace-norm distance to the set of positive semidefinite operators and the maximal witnessable negative quasiprobability, and its time-averaged value decreases across the ergodic-fractal-localized crossover in close correspondence with the fractal dimension.</description>

      <title>The superradiant phase is a finite size effect in two-photon processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon light-matter interactions exhibit distinctive features such as spectral collapse. The two-photon Dicke model has been reported to exhibit a superradiant phase which could be useful in quantum applications. Here we show that this superradiant phase is not a genuine thermodynamic phase but a finite-size effect. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the superradiant region shrinks with increasing system size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit, while spectral collapse remains. Our results clarify the nature of superradiant conditions in two-photon systems and constrain its realization in quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Superfluidity in the spin-1/2 XY model with power-law interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In trapped-ion quantum simulators, effective spin-1/2 XY interactions can be engineered via laser-induced coupling between internal atomic states and collective phonon modes. In the simplest one-dimensional ($1d$) traps, these interactions decay as a power-law with distance $1/r^{\alpha}$, with a tunable exponent $\alpha$. For small $\alpha$, the resulting long-range $1d$ XY model exhibits continuous symmetry breaking, in marked contrast to its nearest neighbor counterpart. In this paper, we examine this model near the phase transition at $\alpha_c$ from the lens of the spin stiffness, or superfluid density. We develop a stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation and a generalized winding number estimator to measure the superfluid density in the presence of power-law interactions, which we test against exact diagonalization for small lattice sizes. Our results show how conventional superfluidity in the $1d$ XY model is enhanced in the long-range interacting regime. This is observed as a diverging superfluid density as $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, which we show is consistent with linear spin-wave theory. Finally, we define a normalized superfluid density estimator that clearly distinguishes the short, medium, and long-range interacting regimes, providing a novel QMC probe of the critical value $\alpha_c$.</description>

      <title>Steering Active-Colloid Assembly by Biasing Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex nonequilibrium self-assembly enables the formation of materials with specific patterns and functions from the bottom up. How to directionally control the assembly to form the target configuration is a challenge. Here, we propose a dissipation bias principle for targeted assembly, which highlights that controlling the dissipation tendency can play an important role by modulating the frequency and intensity of local rearrangements. Following this principle, one can induce ordered target configurations from disordered structures and also achieve directional selection among multiple assembly pathways. We use the assembly of active colloids as a platform to show our results.</description>

      <title>Quantum statistics from classical simulations via generative Gibbs sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of nuclear quantum effects is essential for molecular modeling but expensive using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). We present GG-PI, a ring-polymer-based framework that combines generative modeling of the single-bead conditional density with Gibbs sampling to recover quantum statistics from classical simulation data. GG-PI uses inexpensive standard classical simulations or existing data for training and allows transfer across temperatures without retraining. On standard test systems, GG-PI significantly reduces wall clock time compared to PIMD. Our approach extends easily to a wide range of problems with similar Markov structure.</description>

      <title>Critical Charge and Current Fluctuations across a Voltage-Driven Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate bias-driven non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions in a paradigmatic quantum-transport setup: an interacting quantum dot coupled to non-interacting metallic leads. Using the Random Phase Approximation, which is exact in the limit of a large number of dot levels, we map out the zero-temperature non-equilibrium phase diagram as a function of interaction strength and applied bias. We focus our analysis on the behavior of the charge susceptibility and the current noise in the vicinity of the transition. Remarkably, despite the intrinsically non-equilibrium nature of the steady state, critical charge fluctuations admit an effective-temperature description, $T_{\text{eff}}(T,V)$, that collapses the steady-state behavior onto its equilibrium form. In sharp contrast, current fluctuations exhibit genuinely non-equilibrium features: the fluctuation-dissipation ratio becomes negative in the ordered phase, corresponding to a negative effective temperature for the current degrees of freedom. These results establish current noise as a sensitive probe of critical fluctuations at non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions and open new directions for exploring voltage-driven critical phenomena in quantum transport systems.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium noise emerging from broken detailed balance in active gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In thermodynamic equilibrium, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem links thermal fluctuations and dissipation. Biological systems, however, are driven out of equilibrium by internal processes that produce additional, active fluctuations. Despite being relevant for biological functions such as intracellular transport, predicting the statistical properties of active fluctuations remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge in a minimal model of an active gel as a network of elastic elements connected by transient crosslinks. The crosslinkers' binding and unbinding rates break detailed balance, which drives the system out of equilibrium. Through coarse-graining, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations including an active noise term, which emerges explicitly from the breaking of detailed balance. Finally, we provide predictions for the stochastic motion of a tracer particle embedded in the active gel, which enables comparisons with microrheology experiments both in synthetic active gels and in cells. Overall, our work provides an explicit link between the statistical properties of active fluctuations and the molecular breaking of detailed balance. Thus, it paves the way toward complementing the fluctuation-dissipation theorem with a fluctuation-activity relation in active systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Symmetry Classification of Many-Body Localized Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization admits a complete symmetry classification given by the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) tenfold scheme, whereas an analogous framework for interacting many-body localization (MBL) has remained elusive. Here we develop a symmetry-based classification of static MBL phases formulated at the level of local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We show that a symmetry is compatible with stable MBL if and only if its action can be consistently represented within a quasi-local LIOM algebra, without enforcing extensive degeneracies or nonlocal operator mixing. This criterion sharply distinguishes symmetry classes: onsite Abelian symmetries are compatible with stable MBL and can host distinct symmetry-protected topological MBL phases, whereas continuous non-Abelian symmetries generically preclude stable MBL. By systematically combining AZ symmetries with additional onsite symmetries, we construct a complete classification table of MBL phases, identify stable, fragile, and unstable classes, and provide representative lattice realizations. Our results establish a unified and physically transparent framework for understanding symmetry constraints on MBL.</description>

      <title>Time complexity of a monitored quantum search with resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching a database is a central task in computer science and is paradigmatic of transport and optimization problems in physics. For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $\tau(N)=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics. We optimize the search time as a function of the hopping amplitude, detection rate, and resetting rate, and identify the conditions under which time complexity could outperform Grover's scaling. The overall search time does not violate Grover's optimality bound when including the time budget of the physical implementation of the measurement. For databases of finite sizes monitoring can warrant rapid convergence and provides a promising avenue for fault-tolerant quantum searches.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced excitability: bloom, bust and extirpation in autotoxic population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species populations often modify their environment as they grow. When environmental feedback operates more slowly than population growth, the system can undergo boom-bust dynamics, where the population overshoots its carrying capacity and subsequently collapses. In extreme cases, this collapse leads to total extinction. While deterministic models typically fail to capture these finite-time extinction events, we propose a stochastic framework, derived from an individual-based model, to describe boom-bust-extirpation dynamics. We identify a noise-driven, threshold-like behavior where, depending on initial conditions, the population either undergoes a "boom" or is extirpated before the expansion occurs. Furthermore, we characterize a transition between an excitable regime, where most trajectories are captured by the absorbing state immediately after the first bust, and a persistent regime, where most populations reach a metastable state. We show that this transition is governed by the diffusion strength and the ratio of environmental-to-population timescales. This framework provides a theoretical basis for understanding irreversible transitions in invasive species, plant succession, and microbial dynamics.</description>

      <title>A scalable flow-based approach to mitigate topological freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As lattice gauge theories with non-trivial topological features are driven towards the continuum limit, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suffer for topological freezing, i.e., a dramatic growth of autocorrelations in topological observables. A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Directionality and node heterogeneity reshape criticality in hypergraph percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed and heterogeneous hypergraphs capture directional higher-order interactions with intrinsically asymmetric functional dependencies among nodes. As a result, damage to certain nodes can suppress entire hyperedges, whereas failure of others only weakens interactions. Metabolic reaction networks offer an intuitive example of such asymmetric dependencies. Here we develop a message-passing and statistical mechanics framework for percolation in directed hypergraphs that explicitly incorporates directionality and node heterogeneity. Remarkably, we show that these hypergraph features have a fundamental effect on the critical properties of hypergraph percolation, reshaping criticality in a way that depends on network structure. Specifically, we derive anomalous critical exponents that depend on whether node or hyperedge percolation is considered in maximally correlated, heavy-tailed regimes. These theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic hypergraph models and on a real directed metabolic network, opening new perspectives for the characterization of the robustness and resilience of real-world directed, heterogeneous higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of density in the non-equilibrium steady state of boundary-driven diffusive systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A diffusive system coupled to unequal boundary reservoirs reaches a non-equilibrium steady state. While the full-counting-statistics of current fluctuations in these states are well understood for generic systems, results for steady-state density fluctuations remain limited to only a few integrable models. By obtaining an exact solution of the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, we characterize steady-state density fluctuations through large deviations for a wide range of boundary-driven diffusive systems. This allows us to identify two distinct classes of systems, one with only short-range correlations and another displaying long-range correlations. We also quantitatively describe the irreversible dynamical paths leading to these rare fluctuations in such systems. For very generic systems in arbitrary dimensions, we use a perturbation around the equilibrium state to solve for large deviations and the corresponding fluctuation paths. We find that non-locality in the large deviations emerges only at quadratic order in the perturbation, revealing non-trivial features of long-range correlations in non-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of classical and quantum ergotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the ergotropy (a.k.a. available energy), namely the maximal amount of energy that can be extracted from a thermally isolated system, is a central problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g. in plasma physics and astrophysics, where the basic principles for its solution are known for the case of collisionless fluids. Here we provide the general analytical expression of ergotropy of classical systems valid regardless of their size and the type of interparticle interactions, and show that it emerges as the classical limit of the quantum expression of ergotropy, for quantum systems that are classically ergodic. We thus establish a unified theory of classical and quantum ergotropy, whose applicability ranges from atomic to galactic scale. Such unified theory is indispensable for studying the genuine quantum signatures of ergotropy: We show that the celebrated decomposition of quantum ergotropy into coherent ant inchoherent parts survives in the classical regime, indicating that coherences do not necessarily reveal quantumness. The unified theory also allows to port tools and methods across the classical-quantum boundary to unlock the solution of standing problems. We apply this to swiftly solve the open problem of ergotropy extraction in the classical regime.</description>

      <title>When Normality Tests Detect Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of non-Gaussianity. This idea extends to systems that are not literally finite by assigning them a notional $N$ that captures the same deviation. For an ideal gas with $N$ insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity distribution that maximises Havrda-Charv\'at entropy departs markedly from the Maxwell--Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five standard normality tests -- Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cram\'er--von Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk -- respond to samples drawn from this finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte Carlo study maps the tests' statistical power across system size $N$ and sample size $n$, providing practical reference tables and a heuristic scaling law, visualised as a contour plot, that together indicate when finite-size effects remain detectable.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of heat transport in classical one-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical studies of some unidimensional systems suggest that Fourier law is satisfied, where theory predicts a divergence of heat conductivity with the system size. Here, I revisit some such models, finding that in all cases a divergence asymptotically emerges. This includes a variant of the ding-a-ling model, where I find that, contrary to previous claims, the ``anomalous" growth starts already for moderate system sizes. More conceptually interesting is the case of non-binding potentials, whose behavior is well reproduced by assuming that the energy flux across the nonequilibrium stationary state is the sum of two contributions: a diffusive and a hydrodynamic one. This approach, which extends an idea previously formulated for nearly integrable systems, allows to conclude that the asymptotic regime is always dominated by the anomalous hydrodynamic component, but the crossover may occur for extremely long system sizes.</description>

      <title>Active-Absorbing Phase Transitions in the Parallel Minority Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parallel Minority Game (PMG) is a synchronous adaptive multi-agent model that exhibits active-absorbing transitions characteristic of non-equilibrium statistical systems. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $\beta\approx1.00$, $\delta\approx0.5$, and $\nu_{\parallel}\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $\beta\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to the critical behavior of the model. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behavior in socio-economic and active systems.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e magnetism in a bilayer Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns in magnetic bilayers generate spatially modulated interlayer exchange interactions that can give rise to nonuniform magnetic textures. We study a minimal classical bilayer Ising model with a moir\'e-modulated interlayer coupling, generated either by relative twist or differential strain between the layers. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the ordering transition remains in the conventional two-dimensional Ising universality class, even when the low-temperature state is domain-textured. At low temperatures, we find a smooth crossover between a uniform ferromagnet and domain-textured state, in which the spins locally follow the sign of the interlayer exchange. We demonstrate that there is no breaking of layer symmetry for twisted bilayers. The location of the crossover is determined by a simple geometric energy balance between bulk interlayer exchange and intralayer domain-wall costs. Our results provide a minimal framework for understanding how moir\'e-modulated magnetic textures can emerge from geometric energetics without requiring a thermodynamic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Concentrated Monte Carlo sampling for local observables in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are widely used to estimate observables in many-body quantum systems. However, conventional sampling schemes often require a large number of samples to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this work we propose the concentrated Monte Carlo sampling approach, which builds on the idea that in systems with only short range correlations, to obtain accurate expectation values for local observables, one would favor detailed information in the surroundings of this observable compared to far away from it. In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. Our results demonstrate that CMCS yields higher accuracy for local observables in short-range correlated states while requiring substantially fewer samples, showcasing in which regimes one can obtain acceleration for the evaluation of expectation values.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06768v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and relaxation of topological excitations in layered spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\bar z$ scaling as $\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\bar z \sim \log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \sim (\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory approach for multistage chemical kinetics in liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.</description>

      <title>Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$, and bounded cylinder. Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction with spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking: order emerges from two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with manifold topology determining the character of emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures: bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. Unlike conventional symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise. On the sphere, the structure normal precesses diffusively on the Goldstone manifold with correlation time $\tau_c \approx 18$, a classical realization of type-A dissipative Nambu-Goldstone dynamics. The model requires no thermodynamic gradients, no fine-tuning, and no slow external input. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems. The model admits a large-$N$ limit yielding statistical field theory on Riemannian surfaces, while remaining experimentally realizable in colloidal and soft matter systems.</description>
