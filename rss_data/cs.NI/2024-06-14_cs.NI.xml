      <title>A new approach for predicting the Quality of Experience in multimedia services using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's world, the Internet is recognized as one of the essentials of human life, playing a significant role in communications, business, and lifestyle. The quality of internet services can have widespread negative impacts on individual and social levels. Consequently, Quality of Service (QoS) has become a fundamental necessity for service providers in a competitive market aiming to offer superior services. The success and survival of these providers depend on their ability to maintain high service quality and ensure satisfaction.Alongside QoS, the concept of Quality of Experience (QoE) has emerged with the development of telephony networks. QoE focuses on the user's satisfaction with the service, helping operators adjust their services to meet user expectations. Recent research shows a trend towards utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict QoE. Researchers aim to develop accurate models by leveraging large volumes of data from network and user interactions, considering various real-world scenarios. Despite the complexity of network environments, this research provides a practical framework for improving and evaluating QoE. This study presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating QoE in multimedia services, adhering to the ITU-T P.1203 standard which includes automated data collection processes and uses machine learning algorithms to predict user satisfaction based on key network parameters. By collecting over 20,000 data records from different network conditions and users, the Random Forest model achieved a prediction accuracy of 95.8% for user satisfaction. This approach allows operators to dynamically allocate network resources in real-time, maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction with minimal costs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Path Selections with Interference Graphs in Multihop Relay Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multihop relay wireless networks have gained traction due to the emergence of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) which can be used as relays in high frequency range wireless network, including THz or mmWave. To select paths in these networks, the transmission performance plays the key network in these networks. In this paper, we enhance and greatly simplify the path selection in multihop relay RIS enabled wireless networks with what we refer to as interference graphs. Interference graphs are created based on SNR model, conical and cylindrical beam shapes in the transmission and the related interference model. Once created, they can be simply and efficiently used to select valid paths, without overestimation of the effect of interference. The results show that decreased ordering of conflict selections in the graphs yields the best results, as compared to conservative approach that tolerates no interference.</description>

      <title>MEGA: Maximum-Entropy Genetic Algorithm for Router Nodes Placement in Wireless Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have seen significant advancements due to their simple deployment, cost-effectiveness, ease of implementation and reliable service coverage. However, despite these advantages, the placement of nodes in WMNs presents a critical challenge that significantly impacts their performance. This issue is recognized as an NP-hard problem, underscoring the necessity of development optimization algorithms, such as heuristic and metaheuristic approaches. This motivates us to develop the Maximum Entropy Genetic Algorithm (MEGA) to address the issue of mesh router node placement in WMNs. To assess the proposed method, we conducted experiments across various scenarios with different settings, focusing on key metrics such as network connectivity and user coverage. The simulation results show a comparison of MEGA with other prominent algorithms, such as the Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), revealing MEGA's effectiveness and usability in determining optimal locations for mesh routers.</description>

      <title>The Observer Effect in Computer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network measurement involves an inherent tradeoff between accuracy and overhead; higher accuracy typically comes at the expense of greater measurement overhead (measurement frequency, number of probe packets, etc.). Capturing the "right" balance between these two desiderata - high accuracy and low overhead - is a key challenge. However, the manner in which accuracy and overhead are traded off is specific to the measurement method, rendering apples-to-apples comparisons difficult. To address this, we put forth a novel analytical framework for quantifying the accuracy-overhead tradeoff for network measurements. Our framework, inspired by the observer effect in modern physics, introduces the notion of a network observer factor, which formally captures the relation between measurement accuracy and overhead. Using our "network observer framework", measurement methods for the same task can be characterized in terms of their network observer factors, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by showing how it can be applied to various application domains and validate its conclusions through experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed Quantum Communication with Surface and Hypergraph Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connecting multiple processors via quantum interconnect technologies could help to overcome issues of scalability in single-processor quantum computers. Transmission via these interconnects can be performed more efficiently using quantum multiplexing, where information is encoded in high-dimensional photonic degrees of freedom. We explore the effects of multiplexing on logical error rates in surface codes and hypergraph product codes. We show that, although multiplexing makes loss errors more damaging, assigning qubits to photons in an intelligent manner can minimize these effects, and the ability to encode higher-distance codes in a smaller number of photons can result in overall lower logical error rates. This multiplexing technique can also be adapted to quantum communication and multimode quantum memory with high-dimensional qudit systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication represents a revolutionary advancement over classical information theory, which leverages unique quantum mechanics properties like entanglement to achieve unprecedented capabilities in secure and efficient information transmission. Unlike bits in classical communication, quantum communication utilizes qubits in superposition states, allowing for novel information storage and processing. Entanglement, a key quantum phenomenon, enables advanced protocols with enhanced security and processing power. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of quantum communication, emphasizing the role of entanglement in theoretical foundations, practical protocols, experimental progress, and security implications. It contrasts quantum communications potential applications with classical networks, identifying areas where entanglement offers significant advantages. The paper explores the fundamentals of quantum mechanics in communication, the physical realization of quantum information, and the formation of secure quantum networks through entanglement-based strategies like Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and teleportation. It addresses the challenges of long-distance quantum communication, the role of quantum repeaters in scaling networks, and the conceptualization of interconnected quantum networks. Additionally, it discusses strides towards the Quantum Internet, Quantum Error-Correcting codes, and quantum cryptographys role in ensuring secure communication. By highlighting the role of entanglement, this paper aims to inspire further research and innovation in secure and efficient information exchange within quantum networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relevance of studies in queuing theory in social systems has inspired its adoption in other mainstream technologies with its application in distributed and communication systems becoming an intense research domain. Considerable work has been done regarding the application of the impatient queuing phenomenon in distributed computing to achieve optimal resource sharing and allocation for performance improvement. Generally, there are two types of common impatient queuing behaviour that have been well studied, namely balking and reneging, respectively. In this survey, we are interested in the third type of impatience: jockeying, a phenomenon that draws origins from impatient customers switching from one queue to another.
  This survey chronicles classical and latest efforts that labor to model and exploit the jockeying behaviour in queuing systems, with a special focus on those related to information and communication systems, especially in the context of Multi-Access Edge Computing. We comparatively summarize the reviewed literature regarding their methodologies, invoked models, and use cases.</description>
