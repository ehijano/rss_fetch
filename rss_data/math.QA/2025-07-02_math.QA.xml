      <title>Action of the Witt algebra on categorified quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an action of the positive Witt algebra on the categorified quantum group associated to a simply-laced Lie algebra. In the type A case, we show that this action induces an action of the positive Witt algebra on $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-foams, recovering the action of Qi, Robert, Sussan, and Wagner. We also show that this construction is compatible with the trace decategorification, inducing the action of the positive Witt algebra on the current algebra.</description>

      <title>Burnside rings for racks and quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We restructure and advance the classification theory of finite racks and quandles by employing powerful methods from transformation groups and representation theory, especially Burnside rings. These rings serve as universal receptacles for those invariants of racks and quandles that are additive with respect to decompositions. We present several fundamental results regarding their structure, including additive bases and multiplicative generators. We also develop a theory of marks, which is analogous to counting fixed points of group actions and computing traces in character theory, and which is comprehensive enough to distinguish different elements in the Burnside rings. The new structures not only offer a fresh framework for the classification theory of finite racks and quandles but also equip us with tools to develop these ideas and create interfaces that strengthen connections with related areas of algebra. For example, they extend the Dress--Siebeneicher theory of the Burnside ring of the infinite cyclic group beyond the realm of permutation racks.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf tube algebra for domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro type topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) by constructing domain wall tube algebras. We begin by analyzing the domain wall tube algebra associated with bimodule categories, and then extend the construction to multimodule categories over $N$ base fusion categories. We prove that the resulting tube algebra is naturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure. We show that topological excitations localized on domain walls are classified by representations of the corresponding domain wall tube algebra, in the sense that the functor category of bimodules admits a fusion-preserving embedding into the representation category of the domain wall tube algebra. We further establish the folding trick and Morita theory in this context. Then, most crucially, we provide a rigorous construction of the Drinfeld quantum double from weak Hopf boundary tube algebras using a skew-pairing, and establish an isomorphism between domain wall tube algebra and Drinfeld quantum double of boundary tube algebras. Motivated by the correspondence between the domain wall tube algebra and the quantum double of the boundary tube algebras, we introduce the notion of an $N$-tuple algebra and demonstrate how it arises in the multimodule domain wall setting. Finally, we consider defects between two domain walls, showing that such defects can be characterized by representations of a domain wall defect tube algebra. We briefly outline how these defects can be systematically treated within this representation-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Projective symmetries of three-dimensional TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum field theory has various projective characteristics which are captured by what are called anomalies. This paper explores this idea in the context of fully-extended three-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs).
  Given a three-dimensional TQFT (valued in the Morita 3-category of fusion categories), the anomaly identified herein is an obstruction to gauging a naturally occurring orthogonal group of symmetries. In other words, the classical symmetry group almost acts: There is a lack of coherence at the top level. This lack of coherence is captured by a "higher (central) extension" of the orthogonal group, obtained via a modification of the obstruction theory of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik-Meir [ENO10]. This extension tautologically acts on the given TQFT/fusion category, and this precisely classifies a projective (equivalently anomalous) TQFT. We explain the sense in which this is an analogue of the classical spin representation. This is an instance of a phenomenon emphasized by Freed [Fre23]: Quantum theory is projective.
  We also establish a general relationship between the language of projectivity/anomalies and the language of topological symmetries. We also identify a universal anomaly associated with any theory which is appropriately "simple".</description>

      <title>The Chern-Weil homomorphism for deformed Hopf-Galois extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the Chern-Weil theory for Hopf-Galois extensions originally introduced by Hajac and Maszczyk in the context of coalgebra extensions. We show that the cyclic homology Chern-Weil homomorphism defines natural transformations between Hopf-Galois extensions with a strong connection (principal comodule algebras) and cyclic homology, thereby generalizing the concept of characteristic classes to the noncommutative setting. In the second part, we study the effect of $2$-cocycle deformations of Hopf-Galois extensions on the aforementioned homomorphism. We consider the $2$-cocycle coming from the structure Hopf algebra of the extension, an external symmetry, and finally the combined case.</description>

      <title>Quantum superalgebras and the free-fermionic Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free-fermion point refers to a $\operatorname{GL}(2)\times\operatorname{GL}(1)$ parametrized Yang-Baxter equation within the six-vertex model. It has been known for a long time that this is connected with the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$. We demonstrate that $R$-matrices from the finite quantum superalgebra $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ produce a dense subset of the free-fermionic Yang-Baxter equations of the six-vertex model, matching those of the prime, simple modules in the affine quantum superalgebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(1|1))$. Either of these quantum groups can be used to generate the full free-fermion point, and we discuss them both. Our discussion includes 6 families of six-vertex models used by Brubaker, Bump, and Friedberg in connection with Tokuyama's theorem, a deformation of the Weyl character formula. Thus our work gives quantum group interpretations for those models, known informally as Tokuyama ice.</description>
