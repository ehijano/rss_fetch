      <title>Optimal Execution under Liquidity Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an optimal execution strategy for purchasing a large block of shares over a fixed time horizon. The execution problem is subject to a general price impact that gradually dissipates due to market resilience. This resilience is modeled through a potentially arbitrary limit-order book shape. To account for liquidity dynamics, we introduce a stochastic volume effect governing the recovery of the deviation process, which represents the difference between the impacted and unaffected price. Additionally, we incorporate stochastic liquidity variations through a regime-switching Markov chain to capture abrupt shifts in market conditions. We study this singular control problem, where the trader optimally determines the timing and rate of purchases to minimize execution costs. The associated value function to this optimization problem is shown to satisfy a system of variational Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman inequalities. Moreover, we establish that it is the unique viscosity solution to this HJB system and study the analytical properties of the free boundary separating the execution and continuation regions. To illustrate our results, we present numerical examples under different limit-order book configurations, highlighting the interplay between price impact, resilience dynamics, and stochastic liquidity regimes in shaping the optimal execution strategy.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional queue-reactive model and signal-driven models: a unified framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Markovian market model driven by a hidden Brownian efficient price. In particular, we extend the queue-reactive model, making its dynamics dependent on the efficient price. Our study focuses on two sub-models: a signal-driven price model where the mid-price jump rates depend on the efficient price and an observable signal, and the usual queue-reactive model dependent on the efficient price via the intensities of the order arrivals. This way, we are able to correlate the evolution of limit order books of different stocks. We prove the stability of the observed mid-price around the efficient price under natural assumptions. Precisely, we show that at the macroscopic scale, prices behave as diffusions. We also develop a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the model, and test it numerically. Our model is them used to backest trading strategies in a liquidation context.</description>
