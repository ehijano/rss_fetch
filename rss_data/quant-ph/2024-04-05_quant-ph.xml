      <title>Teleportation of a qubit using exotic entangled coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the exotic Landau problem at the classical level where two conserved quantities are derived. At the quantum level, the corresponding quantum operators of the conserved quantities provide two oscillator representations from which we derive two Boson Fock spaces. Using the normalized coherent states which are the minimum uncertainty states on non-commutative configuration space isomorphic to each of the boson Fock space, we form entangled coherent states which are Bell-like states labeled quasi-Bell states. The effect of non-maximality of a quasi-Bell state based quantum channel is investigated in the context of a teleportation of a qubit</description>

      <title>Surrogate optimization of variational quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum eigensolvers are touted as a near-term algorithm capable of impacting many applications. However, the potential has not yet been realized, with few claims of quantum advantage and high resource estimates, especially due to the need for optimization in the presence of noise. Finding algorithms and methods to improve convergence is important to accelerate the capabilities of near-term hardware for VQE or more broad applications of hybrid methods in which optimization is required. To this goal, we look to use modern approaches developed in circuit simulations and stochastic classical optimization, which can be combined to form a surrogate optimization approach to quantum circuits. Using an approximate (classical CPU/GPU) state vector simulator as a surrogate model, we efficiently calculate an approximate Hessian, passed as an input for a quantum processing unit or exact circuit simulator. This method will lend itself well to parallelization across quantum processing units. We demonstrate the capabilities of such an approach with and without sampling noise and a proof-of-principle demonstration on a quantum processing unit utilizing 40 qubits.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Quenches for Efficient Critical Ground State Preparation in Two-Dimensional Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators have the potential to shed light on the study of quantum many-body systems and materials, offering unique insights into various quantum phenomena. While adiabatic evolution has been conventionally employed for state preparation, it faces challenges when the system evolves too quickly or the coherence time is limited. In such cases, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as spatiotemporal quenches, provide a promising alternative. This paper numerically investigates the application of spatiotemporal quenches in the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model with ferromagnetic interactions, focusing on the emergence of the ground state and its correlation properties at criticality when the gap vanishes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these quenches in rapidly preparing ground states in critical systems. Our simulations reveal the existence of an optimal quench front velocity at the emergent speed of light, leading to minimal excitation energy density and correlation lengths of the order of finite system sizes we can simulate. These findings emphasize the potential of spatiotemporal quenches for efficient ground state preparation in quantum systems, with implications for the exploration of strongly correlated phases and programmable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence an expected phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Simulation in the Interaction Picture Using the Magnus Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for simulating the dynamics of a geometrically local Hamiltonian $A$ under a small geometrically local perturbation $\alpha B$. In certain regimes, the algorithm achieves the optimal scaling and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. By moving into the interaction frame of $A$ and classically computing the Magnus expansion of the interaction-picture Hamiltonian, our algorithm bypasses the need for ancillary qubits. In analyzing its performance, we develop a framework to capture the quasi-locality of the Magnus operators, leading to a tightened bound for the error of the Magnus truncation. The Lieb-Robinson bound also guarantees the efficiency of computing the Magnus operators and of their subsequent decomposition into elementary quantum gates. These features make our algorithm appealing for near-term and early-fault-tolerant simulations.</description>

      <title>Critical Properties of Weak Measurement Induced Phase Transitions in Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of different forms of weak measurements on the nature of the measurement induced phase transition are theoretically studied in hybrid random quantum circuits of qubits. We use a combination of entanglement measures, ancilla purification dynamics, and a transfer matrix approach to compute the critical exponents, the effective central charge, and the multifractal spectrum of the measurement induced transitions. We compare weak measurements with an infinite number of discrete outcomes to a protocol with only a pair of outcomes and find that to within our numerical accuracy the universal critical properties are unaffected by the weak measurement protocols and are consistent with the universality class found for strong projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature entanglement membranes in quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems, the entanglement of a region $A$ can be described in terms of the surface tension of a spacetime membrane pinned to the boundary of $A$. Here, we interpret the tension of this entanglement membrane in terms of the rate at which information "flows" across it. For any orientation of the membrane, one can define (generically nonunitary) dynamics across the membrane; we explore this dynamics in various space-time translation-invariant (STTI) stabilizer circuits in one and two spatial dimensions. We find that the flux of information across the membrane in these STTI circuits reaches a steady state. In the cases where this dynamics is nonunitary and the steady state flux is nonzero, this occurs because the dynamics across the membrane is unitary in a subspace of extensive entropy. This generalized unitarity is present in a broad class of STTI stabilizer circuits, and is also present in some special non-stabilizer models. The existence of multiple unitary (or generalized unitary) directions forces the entanglement membrane tension to be a piecewise linear function of the orientation of the membrane; in this respect, the entanglement membrane behaves like an interface in a zero-temperature classical lattice model. We argue that entanglement membranes in random stabilizer circuits that produce volume-law entanglement are also effectively at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Dephasing in Fluxonium Qubits from Coherent Quantum Phase Slips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase slips occur across all Josephson junctions (JJs) at a rate that increases with the impedance of the junction. In superconducting qubits composed of JJ-array superinductors -- such as fluxonium -- phase slips in the array can lead to decoherence. In particular, phase-slip processes at the individual array junctions can coherently interfere, each with an Aharonov--Casher phase that depends on the offset charges of the array islands. These coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) perturbatively modify the qubit frequency, and therefore charge noise on the array islands will lead to dephasing. By varying the impedance of the array junctions, we design a set of fluxonium qubits in which the expected phase-slip rate within the JJ-array changes by several orders of magnitude. We characterize the coherence times of these qubits and demonstrate that the scaling of CQPS-induced dephasing rates agrees with our theoretical model. Furthermore, we perform noise spectroscopy of two qubits in regimes dominated by either CQPS or flux noise. We find the noise power spectrum associated with CQPS dephasing appears to be featureless at low frequencies and not $1/f$. Numerical simulations indicate this behavior is consistent with charge noise generated by charge-parity fluctuations within the array. Our findings broadly inform JJ-array-design tradeoffs, relevant for the numerous superconducting qubit designs employing JJ-array superinductors.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Goldilocks quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goldilocks quantum cellular automata (QCA) have been simulated on quantum hardware and produce emergent small-world correlation networks. In Goldilocks QCA, a single-qubit unitary is applied to each qubit in a one-dimensional chain subject to a balance constraint: a qubit is updated if its neighbors are in opposite basis states. Here, we prove that a subclass of Goldilocks QCA -- including the one implemented experimentally -- map onto free fermions and therefore can be classically simulated efficiently. We support this claim with two independent proofs, one involving a Jordan--Wigner transformation and one mapping the integrable six-vertex model to QCA. We compute local conserved quantities of these QCA and predict experimentally measurable expectation values. These calculations can be applied to test large digital quantum computers against known solutions. In contrast, typical Goldilocks QCA have equilibration properties and quasienergy-level statistics that suggest nonintegrability. Still, the latter QCA conserve one quantity useful for error mitigation. Our work provides a parametric quantum circuit with tunable integrability properties with which to test quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Matter waves and clocks do not observe uniform gravitational fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a uniform gravitational field, classical test objects fall universally. Any reference object or observer will fall in the same universal manner. Therefore, a uniform gravitational field cannot create dynamics between observers and classical test objects. The influence of a uniform gravitational field on matter waves and clocks, however, is described inconsistently throughout research and education. To illustrate, we discuss the behavior of a matter-wave interferometer and a clock redshift experiment in a uniform gravitational field. As a consistent formulation of the equivalence principle implies, a uniform gravitational field has no observable influence on these systems and is physically equivalent to the absence of gravity.</description>

      <title>Promatch: Extending the Reach of Real-Time Quantum Error Correction with Adaptive Predecoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing relies on Quantum Error Correction, which encodes logical qubits into data and parity qubits. Error decoding is the process of translating the measured parity bits into types and locations of errors. To prevent a backlog of errors, error decoding must be performed in real-time. Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) is an accurate decoding algorithm for surface code, and recent research has demonstrated real-time implementations of MWPM (RT-MWPM) for a distance of up to 9. Unfortunately, beyond d=9, the number of flipped parity bits in the syndrome, referred to as the Hamming weight of the syndrome, exceeds the capabilities of existing RT-MWPM decoders. In this work, our goal is to enable larger distance RT-MWPM decoders by using adaptive predecoding that converts high Hamming weight syndromes into low Hamming weight syndromes, which are accurately decoded by the RT-MWPM decoder. An effective predecoder must balance both accuracy and coverage. In this paper, we propose Promatch, a real-time adaptive predecoder that predecodes both simple and complex patterns using a locality-aware, greedy approach. Our approach ensures two crucial factors: 1) high accuracy in prematching flipped bits, ensuring that the decoding accuracy is not hampered by the predecoder, and 2) enough coverage adjusted based on the main decoder's capability given the time constraints. Promatch represents the first real-time decoding framework capable of decoding surface codes of distances 11 and 13, achieving an LER of $2.6\times 10^{-14}$ for distance 13. Moreover, we demonstrate that running Promatch concurrently with the recently proposed Astrea-G achieves LER equivalent to MWPM LER, $3.4\times10^{-15}$, for distance 13, representing the first real-time accurate decoder for up-to a distance of 13.</description>

      <title>Non-variational Quantum Combinatorial Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a non-variational quantum algorithm designed to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimisation problems. The algorithm leverages an engineered interference process achieved through repeated application of two unitaries; one inducing phase-shifts dependent on objective function values, and the other mixing phase-shifted probability amplitudes via a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a problem-specific graph. The algorithm's versatility is demonstrated through its application to various problems, namely those for which solutions are characterised by either a vector of binary variables, a vector of non-binary integer variables, or permutations (a vector of integer variables without repetition). An efficient quantum circuit implementation of the CTQW for each of these problem types is also discussed. A penalty function approach for constrained problems is also introduced, including a method for optimising the penalty function. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through numerical simulation for randomly generated instances of the following problems (and problem sizes): weighted maxcut (18 vertices), maximum independent set (18 vertices), k-means clustering (12 datapoints, 3 clusters), capacitated facility location (12 customers, 3 facility locations), and the quadratic assignment problem (9 locations). For each problem instance, the algorithm finds a globally optimal solution with a small number of iterations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of quantum trajectories in a time-dependent disordered environment is studied. We develop a general framework in which one can study the behavior of quantum trajectories that are obtained by repeated not-necessarily-independent but stationary measurements. Using this framework, we are able to generalize the asymptotic purification results of K\"ummerer and Maassen [KM] to the current setting. Most notably, the concept of a dark subspace from [KM] is generalized to the current setting, which enables us to lift the main theorem of [KM] to the disordered case.</description>

      <title>Direct interpolative construction of the discrete Fourier transform as a matrix product operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform (QFT), which can be viewed as a reindexing of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), has been shown to be compressible as a low-rank matrix product operator (MPO) or quantized tensor train (QTT) operator. However, the original proof of this fact does not furnish a construction of the MPO with a guaranteed error bound. Meanwhile, the existing practical construction of this MPO, based on the compression of a quantum circuit, is not as efficient as possible. We present a simple closed-form construction of the QFT MPO using the interpolative decomposition, with guaranteed near-optimal compression error for a given rank. This construction can speed up the application of the QFT and the DFT, respectively, in quantum circuit simulations and QTT applications. We also connect our interpolative construction to the approximate quantum Fourier transform (AQFT) by demonstrating that the AQFT can be viewed as an MPO constructed using a different interpolation scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dynamical Gauge in the Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gauge dependence of various physical observables in the quantum Rabi model (QRM) under different potential fields, arising from the Hilbert-space truncation of the atomic degree of freedom. We discover that in both the square-well potential and oscillator potential,the optimal gauges for the ground-state energy of the QRM vary with respect to the cavity frequency, with the dipole gauge being optimal in the low-frequency limit and the Coulomb gauge in the high-frequency limit of the cavity frequency. Additionally, for higher energy levels, the optimal gauge asymptotically approaches the dipole gauge. However, for the dynamical quantity out-time-order correlator (OTOC), we find the necessity to introduce an optimal dynamical gauge. We determine the optimal dynamical gauge by minimizing the mean error between the two-level OTOC and the full Hamiltonian one. We expect that this study will contribute to a more profound understanding of the subtle relation between gauge choice and the dynamics of QED systems.</description>

      <title>Commitments are equivalent to one-way state generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-way state generators (OWSG) are natural quantum analogs to classical one-way functions. We show that $O\left(\frac{n}{\log(n)}\right)$-copy OWSGs ($n$ represents the input length) are equivalent to $poly(n)$-copy OWSG and to quantum commitments. Since known results show that $o\left(\frac{n}{\log(n)}\right)$-copy OWSG cannot imply commitments, this shows that $O\left(\frac{n}{\log(n)}\right)$-copy OWSGs are the weakest OWSGs from which we can get commitments (and hence much of quantum cryptography).
  Our construction follows along the lines of H\r{a}stad, Impagliazzo, Levin and Luby [HILL], who obtained classical pseudorandom generators (PRG) from classical one-way functions (OWF), however with crucial modifications. Our construction, when applied to the classical case, provides an alternative to the construction provided by [HILL]. Since we do not argue conditioned on the output of the one-way function, our construction and analysis are arguably simpler and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Steering nonlocality in high-speed telecommunication system without detection loophole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal correlation represents the key feature of quantum mechanics, which is exploited as a resource in quantum information processing. However, the loophole issues hamper the practical applications. We report the first demonstration of steering nonlocality with detection loophole closed at telecommunication wavelengths. In this endeavour, we design and fabricate a low-loss silicon chip for efficient entanglement generation, and further apply the direct modulation technique to its optical pump to eliminate phase-encoding loss at the steering side. The newly proposed phase-encoding measurement setting adapts to an ultra-fast modulation rate (GHz). Consequently, we build a fiber-optic setup that can overcome the detection efficiency that is required by quantum steering with multiple measurement settings. Our setup provides an immediate platform for exploring applications based on steering nonlocality, especially for quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Geometry of degenerate quantum states, configurations of $m$-planes and invariants on complex Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the geometric information contained in quantum states is valuable in various branches of physics, particularly in solid-state physics when Bloch states play a crucial role. While the Fubini-Study metric and Berry curvature form offer comprehensive descriptions of non-degenerate quantum states, a similar description for degenerate states did not exist. In this work, we fill this gap by showing how to reduce the geometry of degenerate states to the non-abelian (Wilczek-Zee) connection $A$ and a previously unexplored matrix-valued metric tensor $G$. Mathematically, this problem is equivalent to finding the $U(N)$ invariants of a configuration of subspaces in $\mathbb{C}^n$. For two subspaces, the configuration was known to be described by a set of $m$ principal angles that generalize the notion of quantum distance. For more subspaces, we find $3 m^2 - 3 m + 1$ additional independent invariants associated with each triple of subspaces. Some of them generalize the Berry-Pancharatnam phase, and some do not have analogues for 1-dimensional subspaces. We also develop a procedure for calculating these invariants as integrals of $A$ and $G$ over geodesics on the Grassmannain manifold. Finally, we briefly discuss possible application of these results to quantum state preparation and $PT$-symmetric band structures.</description>

      <title>Bright Heralded Single-Photon Source with Ideal Purity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an unprecedentedly bright heralded single-photon source with ideal single-photon purity. The source is based on spontaneous four-wave mixing in silicon spiral waveguide excited by a pump with a repetition rate of 2.5 GHz. An explicit theoretical limit of purity of heralded single-photon source is derived, depending on Possoinian and thermal-like light pump, respectively. The measured coincidence counting rate exceeds 1.5 MHz, and the purity estimated by the second-order correlation function reaches the limit with a lowest value of 0.000945 (at a coincidence rate of 0.8 kHz), which has never been achieved by on-chip SFWM sources.</description>

      <title>Stronger Speed Limit for Observables: Tight bound for Capacity of Entanglement, Modular Hamiltonian and Charging of Quantum Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How fast an observable can evolve in time is answered by so-called the observable speed limit. Here, we prove a stronger version of the observable speed limit and show that the previously obtained bound is a special case of the new bound. The stronger quantum speed limit for the state also follows from the stronger quantum speed limit for observables (SQSLO). We apply this to prove a stronger bound for the entanglement rate using the notion of capacity of entanglement (the quantum information theoretic counterpart of the heat capacity) and show that it outperforms previous bounds. Furthermore, we apply the SQSLO for the rate of modular Hamiltonian and in the context of interacting qubits in a quantum battery. These illustrative examples reveal that the speed limit for the modular energy and the time required to charge the battery can be exactly predicted using the new bound. This shows that for estimating the charging time of quantum battery SQSLO is actually tight, i.e., it saturates. Our findings can have important applications in quantum thermodynamics, the complexity of operator growth, predicting the time rate of quantum correlation growth and quantum technology, in general.</description>

      <title>Quantum aggregation with temporal delay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced quantum networking systems rely on efficient quantum error correction codes for their optimal realization. The rate at which the encoded information is transmitted is a fundamental limit that affects the performance of such systems. Quantum aggregation allows one to increase the transmission rate by adding multiple paths connecting two distant users. Aggregating channels of different paths allows more users to simultaneously exchange the encoded information. Recent work has shown that quantum aggregation can also reduce the number of physical resources of an error correction code when it is combined with the quantum multiplexing technique. However, the different channel lengths across the various paths means some of the encoded quantum information will arrive earlier than others and it must be stored in quantum memories. The information stored will then deteriorate due to decoherence processes leading to detrimental effects for the fidelity of the final quantum state. Here, we explore the effects of a depolarization channel that occurs for the quantum Reed-Solomon code when quantum aggregation involving different channel lengths is used. We determine the best distribution of resources among the various channels connecting two remote users. Further we estimate the coherence time required to achieve a certain fidelity. Our results will have a significant impact on the ways physical resources are distributed across a quantum network.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ground State Estimation Using Generalized Hund's Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers offer a promising approach to simulate the ground state of molecules, which is crucial for understanding molecular properties and chemical reactions. However, the limited number of available qubits on current devices poses a challenge for simulation. This paper investigates the feasibility of reducing the qubit usage of molecular simulation by examining specific fermionic states according to Hund's rule.
  We introduced a new framework based on qubit efficiency encoding. Based on this framework, the Hamiltonian is restricted to the Hund subspace. Compared to only concerned particle conservation, the proposed method can reduce $N$ qubit usage for an $M$ orbitals and $N$ electrons molecule when $M\gg N$. Additionally, when using the STO-3G basis sets, the simulations of the $15$ molecules with given molecular geometry by the proposed method are close to the full configuration interaction. The absolute difference is at most $0.121\%$. Meanwhile, predictions from potential energy surfaces using the proposed method have an absolute difference at most $4.1\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise greedy heuristics tailored for synthesizing quantum circuits that implement a specified set of Pauli rotations. Our heuristics are designed to minimize either the count of entangling gates or the depth of entangling gates, and they can be adjusted to either maintain or loosen the ordering of rotations. We present benchmark results demonstrating a depth reduction of up to a factor of 4 compared to the current state-of-the-art heuristics for synthesizing Hamiltonian simulation circuits. We also show that these heuristics can be used to optimize generic quantum circuits by decomposing and resynthesizing them.</description>

      <title>The power of a single Haar random state: constructing and separating quantum pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the following question: what are the cryptographic implications of having access to an oracle that provides a single Haar random quantum state? We show, perhaps surprisingly, that such an oracle is sufficient to construct quantum pseudorandomness.
  Pseudorandom states (PRS) are a family of states for which it is hard to distinguish between polynomially many copies of either a state sampled uniformly from the family or a Haar random state. A weaker notion, called single-copy pseudorandom states (1PRS), satisfies this property with respect to a single copy. Our main result is that 1PRS (as well as bit-commitments) exist relative to an oracle that provides a single Haar random state. We build on this result to show the existence of an oracle relative to which 1PRS exist, but PRS do not. This provides one of the first black-box separations between different forms of quantum pseudorandomness.</description>

      <title>Photonic Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum computation refers to quantum computation that uses photons as the physical system for doing the quantum computation. Photons are ideal quantum systems because they operate at room temperature, and photonic technologies are relatively mature. The field is largely divided between discrete- and continuous-variable photonic quantum computation. In discrete-variable (DV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by one or more modal properties (e.g. polarization) that take on distinct values from a finite set. Quantum information is processed via operations on these modal properties and eventually measured using single photon detectors. In continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by properties of the electromagnetic field that take on any value in an interval (e.g. position). The electromagnetic field is transformed via Gaussian and non-Gaussian operations, and then detected via homodyne detection. Both CV and DV photonic quantum computation have been realized experimentally and they each have a unique set of challenges that need to be overcome to achieve scalable photonic universal quantum computation. This article is an introduction to photonic quantum computing, charting its development from the early days of linear optical quantum computing to recent developments in quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: With a high-loss resonator supplying the non-Hermiticity, we study the Energy level degeneracy and quantum state evolution in tunable coupling superconducting quantum circuit. The qubit's effective energy level and damping rate can be continually tuned in superconducting circuit, and the positions and numbers of level degenerate points are controllable. The efficient of quantum state exchange and the asymmetry of quantum state evolution can be tuned with non-hermitian and nonreciprocal coupling between two qubits. The controllable non-Hermiticity provides new insights and methods for exploring the unconventional quantum effects in superconducting quantum circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting remote objects with higher precision and resolution takes a crucial role in many scientific tasks, such as astronomical observation. Compared with classical telescopes, quantum telescopes can detect more precise angle value for single-star target. The precision of existing quantum telescopes is improved in the scale of square root of incident single photons. Here we propose the piecemeal quantum telescope with bit-by-bit iteration. It improves precision exponentially with number of nincident single-photons in detecting the star angle. As a result, it requests to detect only a few hundreds of photons for a precision breaking classical limit by 4 to 5 magnitude orders. Moreover, it can detect a general astronomical target consisting of unknown number of stars.</description>

      <title>Gibbs-preserving operations requiring infinite amount of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.</description>

      <title>Three perspectives on entropy dynamics in a non-Hermitian two-state system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative study of entropy dynamics as an indicator of physical behavior in an open two-state system with balanced gain and loss is presented. We distinguish the perspective taken in utilizing the conventional framework of Hermitian-adjoint states from an approach that is based on biorthogonal-adjoint states and a third case based on an isospectral mapping. In this it is demonstrated that their differences are rooted in the treatment of the environmental coupling mode. For unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the system, a notable characteristic feature of the perspective taken is the presence or absence of purity oscillations, with an associated entropy revival. The description of the system is then continued from its $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric pseudo-Hermitian phase into the regime of spontaneously broken symmetry, in the latter two approaches through a non-analytic operator-based continuation, yielding a Lindblad master equation based on the $\mathcal{PT}$ charge operator $\mathcal{C}$. This phase transition indicates a general connection between the pseudo-Hermitian closed-system and the Lindbladian open-system formalism through a spontaneous breakdown of the underlying physical reflection symmetry.</description>

      <title>Self-Testing Graph States Permitting Bounded Classical Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-testing identifies quantum states and correlations that exhibit non-locality, distinguishing them, up to local transformations, from other quantum states. Due to their strong non-locality, all graph states can be self-tested with strictly local measurement devices. Moreover, graph states display non-local correlations even when bounded classical communication on the underlying graph is permitted, a feature that has found applications in proving a circuit-depth separation between classical and quantum computing. In the framework of bounded classical communication, we show that certain graph states with appropriate symmetry can be robustly self-tested, by providing an explicit self-test for the circular graph state and the honeycomb cluster state. Since communication generally obstructs self-testing of graph states, we further provide a procedure to robustly self-test any graph state from larger ones that exhibit non-local correlations in the communication scenario. Furthermore, in the standard setup without classical communication, we demonstrate that any graph state from an underlying connected graph with at least three vertices can be robustly self-tested using only Pauli measurements.</description>

      <title>A QAOA approach with fake devices: A case study for the maximum cut in ring graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) can require considerable processing time for developers to test and debug their codes on expensive quantum devices. One avenue to circumvent this difficulty is to use the error maps of quantum devices, where a local simulator can be automatically configured to mimic an actual device backend. In our work, we evaluated some error maps of quantum devices, known as fake devices, that are freely available in the cloud. The QAOA and the problem of maximum cut in 2-regular connected graphs, known as ring of disagrees, were used as tools for the noise analysis. The approximation ratio, the expectation energy and the probability of success for this problem have been evaluated in two scenarios. First, the quantities were studied through noisy simulations using fake devices. Second, error mitigation methods such as optimization levels and translation (connectivity mapping) of the original problem were applied. These results were then compared with the analytical solution of the ring graph. The study shows that error mitigation methods were crucial in obtaining better results for the expectation value of the energy, the approximation ratio, and the probability of success for the ring graphs.</description>

Abstract: Adopting a statistical approach we study the degradation of entanglement of a quantum system under the action of an ensemble of randomly distributed Markovian noise. This enables us to address scenarios where only limited information is available on the mechanisms that rule the noisy evolution of the model. As an application, we characterize the statistic of entanglement deterioration for a quantum memory formed by $n$ qudits that undergo randomly distributed local, uniform, Markovian noise evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing sophistication and capability of quantum hardware, its integration, and employment in high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure becomes relevant. This opens largely unexplored access models and scheduling questions in such quantum-classical computing environments, going beyond the current cloud access model. SCIM MILQ is a scheduler for quantum tasks in HPC infrastructure. It combines well-established scheduling techniques with methods unique to quantum computing, such as circuit cutting. SCIM MILQ can schedule tasks while minimizing the makespan, i.e., the length of time that elapses from the start of work to the end, improving on average 25%. Additionally it reduces noise in the circuit up to 10%, increasing the outcome's reliability. We compare it against an existing baseline and show its viability in an HPC environment.</description>

      <title>Operator growth and spread complexity in open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commonly, the notion of "quantum chaos'' refers to the fast scrambling of information throughout complex quantum systems undergoing unitary evolution. Motivated by the Krylov complexity and the operator growth hypothesis, we demonstrate that the entropy of the population distribution for an operator in time is a useful way to capture the complexity of the internal information dynamics of a system when subject to an environment and is, in principle, agnostic to the specific choice of operator basis. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, examining the dynamics of the system in both its Krylov basis and the basis of operator strings. We prove that the former basis minimises spread complexity while the latter is an eigenbasis for high dissipation. In both cases, we probe the long-time dynamics of the model and the phenomenological effects of decoherence on the complexity of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum querying based on multicontrolled Toffoli gates for causal Feynman loop configurations and directed acyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are a promising framework for a proper treatment of Feynman loop integrals due to the existence of a manifestly causal representation scenario. Particularly, unfolding causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams is understood as querying \textit{directed acyclic graph} (DAG) configurations of undirected graphs in graph theory. In this paper we present a quantum algorithm for querying causality of multiloop Feynman diagrams using an ingenious change in the logic of the design of the oracle operator. The construction of the quantum oracle is surprisingly based exclusively on multicontrolled Toffoli gates and XNOT gates. The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated performing a comparison with a quantum algorithm based on binary clauses. Additionally, we explicitly analise several three-, four- and five-eloop topologies, which have not been previously explored due to their higher complexity.</description>

      <title>A quantum Pascal pyramid and an extended de Moivre-Laplace theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pascal's triangle is widely used as a pedagogical tool to explain the "first-order" multiplet patterns that arise in the spectra of $I_N S$ coupled spin-1/2 systems in magnetic resonance. Various other combinatorial structures, which may be well-known in the broader field of quantum dynamics, appear to have largely escaped the attention of the magnetic resonance community with a few exceptions, despite potential usefulness.
  In this brief set of lecture notes, we describe a "quantum Pascal pyramid" (OEIS $\href{https://oeis.org/A268533}{A268533}$) as a generalization of Pascal's triangle, which is shown to directly map the relationship between multispin operators of arbitrary spin product rank $q$ ($\hat{Z}_N^q$) and population operators for states with magnetic quantum number $m$ ($\hat{S}_N^m$), and - as a consequence - obtain the general form of the intensity ratios of multiplets associated with antiphase single-quantum coherences, with an expression given in terms of the Jacobi polynomials.
  An extension of the de Moivre-Laplace theorem, beyond the trivial case $q=0$, is applied to the $q$-th columns of the quantum Pascal pyramid, and is given in terms of a product of the $q$-th order Hermite polynomials and a Gaussian distribution, reproducing the well-known functional forms of the solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator and the classical limit of Hermite-Gaussian modes in laser physics (Allen et al., $\textit{Phys. Rev. A.}$, $\textbf{45}$, 1992). This is used to approximate the Fourier-transformed spectra of $\hat{Z}_N^q$-associated multiplets of arbitrary complexity.
  Finally, an exercise is shown in which the first two columns of the quantum Pascal pyramid are used to calculate the previously known symmetry-constrained upper bound on $I_z \rightarrow S_z$ polarization transfer in $I_N S$ spin systems.</description>

      <title>PAC-learning of free-fermionic states is NP-hard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-fermionic states, also known as matchgates or Gaussian states, are a fundamental class of quantum states due to their efficient classical simulability and their crucial role across various domains of Physics. With the advent of quantum devices, experiments now yield data from quantum states, including estimates of expectation values. We establish that deciding whether a given dataset, formed by a few Majorana correlation functions estimates, can be consistent with a free-fermionic state is an NP-complete problem. Our result also extends to datasets formed by estimates of Pauli expectation values. This is in stark contrast to the case of stabilizer states, where the analogous problem can be efficiently solved. Moreover, our results directly imply that free-fermionic states are computationally hard to properly PAC-learn, where PAC-learning of quantum states is a learning framework introduced by Aaronson. Remarkably, this is the first class of classically simulable quantum states shown to have this property.</description>

      <title>Deriving Compact QUBO Models via Multilevel Constraint Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advances in customized hardware for quantum annealing and digital/CMOS Annealing, Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models have received growing attention in the optimization literature. Motivated by an existing general-purpose approach that derives QUBO models from binary linear programs (BLP), we propose a novel Multilevel Constraint Transformation Scheme (MLCTS) that derives QUBO models with fewer ancillary binary variables. We formulate sufficient conditions for the existence of a compact QUBO formulation (i.e., in the original BLP decision space) in terms of constraint levelness and demonstrate the flexibility and applicability of MLCTS on synthetic examples and several well-known combinatorial optimization problems, i.e., the Maximum 2-Satisfiability Problem, the Linear Ordering Problem, the Community Detection Problem, and the Maximum Independence Set Problem. For a proof-of-concept, we compare the performance of two QUBO models for the latter problem on both a general-purpose software-based solver and a hardware-based QUBO solver. The MLCTS-derived models demonstrate significantly better performance for both solvers, in particular, solving up to seven times more instances with the hardware-based approach.</description>

      <title>Collective coupling of driven multilevel atoms and its effect on four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic models based on multilevel atoms are central to controlling non-linear optical responses and coherent control of light. These models are traditionally based on single-atom responses that are then parametrically extrapolated to include collective effects, such as an enhanced response or propagation within the medium. In this work we present a systematic analysis of the cooperative effects arising in driven systems composed of multi-level atoms coupled by a common electromagnetic environment. The analysis is based on an interplay between dressed states induced by the driving field, photon exchanges, and the collective decay channels. This theory is applied to the case of four-wave mixing mediated by a pair of atoms in the diamond configuration, a nonlinear process commonly used to create correlated photon pairs. The effects of inter-atomic correlations and collective decay channels over outgoing photons are then explored. We find that the resulting correlation function changes from a Lorentzian distribution for independent atoms to a two-peaked distribution when dipole-dipole interactions are included. The two-peak structure is related to a joint action between the dressed states and the collective decay channels. Signatures of these processes are identified for existing experimental realizations. The intuition obtained from this connection helps to uncover relevant parameters that could be exploited for quantum control protocols based on dispersive and dissipative cooperative effects in multi-level systems.</description>

      <title>Circuit Knitting Faces Exponential Sampling Overhead Scaling Bounded by Entanglement Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit knitting, a method for connecting quantum circuits across multiple processors to simulate nonlocal quantum operations, is a promising approach for distributed quantum computing. While various techniques have been developed for circuit knitting, we uncover fundamental limitations to the scalability of this technology. We prove that the sampling overhead of circuit knitting is exponentially lower bounded by the exact entanglement cost of the target bipartite dynamic, even for asymptotic overhead in the parallel cut regime. Specifically, we prove that the regularized sampling overhead assisted with local operations and classical communication (LOCC), of any bipartite quantum channel is lower bounded by the exponential of its exact entanglement cost under separable preserving operations. Furthermore, we show that the regularized sampling overhead for simulating a general bipartite channel via LOCC is lower bounded by $\kappa$-entanglement and max-Rains information, providing efficiently computable benchmarks. Our work reveals a profound connection between virtual quantum information processing via quasi-probability decomposition and quantum Shannon theory, highlighting the critical role of entanglement in distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Universal Time-Entanglement Trade-off in Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a surprising connection between pure steady state entanglement and relaxation timescales in an extremely broad class of Markovian open systems, where two (possibly many-body) systems $A$ and $B$ interact locally with a common dissipative environment. This setup also encompases a broad class of adaptive quantum dynamics based on continuous measurement and feedback. As steady state entanglement increases, there is generically an emergent strong symmetry that leads to a dynamical slow down. Using this we can prove rigorous bounds on relaxation times set by steady state entanglement. We also find that this time must necessarily diverge for maximal entanglement. To test our bound, we consider the dynamics of a random ensemble of local Lindbladians that support pure steady states, finding that the bound does an excellent job of predicting how the dissipative gap varies with the amount of entanglement. Our work provides general insights into how dynamics and entanglement are connected in open systems, and has specific relevance to quantum reservoir engineering.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation for low-energy states with optimal time dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the task of simulating time evolution under a Hamiltonian $H$ within its low-energy subspace. Assuming access to a block-encoding of $H'=(H-E)/\lambda$ for some $E \in \mathbb R$, the goal is to implement an $\epsilon$-approximation to $e^{-itH}$ when the initial state is confined to the subspace corresponding to eigenvalues $[-1, -1+\Delta/\lambda]$ of $H'$. We present a quantum algorithm that uses $O(t\sqrt{\lambda\Gamma} + \sqrt{\lambda/\Gamma}\log(1/\epsilon))$ queries to the block-encoding for any $\Gamma$ such that $\Delta \leq \Gamma \leq \lambda$. When $\log(1/\epsilon) = o(t\lambda)$ and $\Delta/\lambda = o(1)$, this result improves over generic methods with query complexity $\Omega(t\lambda)$. Our quantum algorithm leverages spectral gap amplification and the quantum singular value transform. Using standard access models for $H$, we show that the ability to efficiently block-encode $H'$ is equivalent to $H$ being what we refer to as a "gap-amplifiable" Hamiltonian. This includes physically relevant examples such as frustration-free systems, and it encompasses all previously considered settings of low-energy simulation algorithms. We also provide lower bounds for low-energy simulation. In the worst case, we show that the low-energy condition cannot be used to improve the runtime of Hamiltonian simulation. For gap-amplifiable Hamiltonians, we prove that our algorithm is tight in the query model with respect to $t$, $\Delta$, and $\lambda$. In the practically relevant regime where $\log (1/\epsilon) = o(t\Delta)$ and $\Delta/\lambda = o(1)$, we also prove a matching lower bound in gate complexity (up to log factors). To establish the query lower bounds, we consider $\mathrm{PARITY}\circ\mathrm{OR}$ and degree bounds on trigonometric polynomials. To establish the lower bound on gate complexity, we use a circuit-to-Hamiltonian reduction acting on a low-energy state.</description>

      <title>Braiding Fibonacci anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01778v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Dispersive shock waves in a one-dimensional droplet environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the controllable generation of distinct types of dispersive shock-waves emerging in a quantum droplet bearing environment with the aid of step-like initial conditions. Dispersive regularization of the ensuing hydrodynamic singularities occurs due to the competition between meanfield repulsion and attractive quantum fluctuations. This interplay delineates the dominance of defocusing (hyperbolic) and focusing (elliptic) hydrodynamic phenomena respectively being designated by real and imaginary speed of sound. Specifically, the symmetries of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii model lead to a three-parameter family, encompassing two densities and a relative velocity, of the underlying Riemann problem utilized herein. Surprisingly, dispersive shock waves persist across the hyperbolic-to-elliptic threshold, while a plethora of additional wave patterns arise, such as rarefaction waves, traveling dispersive shock waves, (anti)kinks and droplet wavetrains. The classification and characterization of these features is achieved by deploying Whitham modulation theory. Our results pave the way for unveiling a multitude of unexplored coherently propagating waveforms in such attractively interacting mixtures and should be detectable by current experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing electron quadrupling order through ultrasound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have pointed to the formation of a new state of matter, the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ . The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the superconducting and normal metal states. The adjacent two critical points make acoustic effects a promising tool to study such states because of their sensitivity to symmetry-breaking transitions. We report a theory of the acoustic effects of systems with an electron quadrupling phase and new ultrasound velocity measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. The presented theory for the electron quadrupling state gives the same type of singularities that are observed in experiment.</description>

      <title>Direct Experimental Constraints on the Spatial Extent of a Neutrino Wavepacket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. They also provide a unique system to study quantum coherence in fundamental systems due to their extremely weak interaction probabilities. The quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are virtually unknown and theoretical predictions for the spatial width of neutrino wavepackets vary by many orders of magnitude. In weak nuclear decay, the size of a neutrino wavepacket, $\sigma_{\nu,x}$, is related to the spatial wavefunction of its parent at production. Here, we present the first direct limits of this quantity through a new experimental concept to extract the energy width, $\sigma_{\textrm{N},E}$, of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the nuclear electron capture (EC) decay of $^7$Be. The final state in the EC decay process contains a recoiling $^7$Li nucleus and an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) which are entangled at their creation. The $^7$Li energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding $^7$Be radioisotopes into a high resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic charge sensitive detector. The lower limit on the spatial coherence of the recoil daughter was found to be $\sigma_{\textrm{N}, x} \geq 6.2$ pm, which implies the system remains in a spatially coherent state much larger than the nuclear scale. Further, this implies a lower limit on the size of a neutrino wavepacket, $\sigma_{\nu,x} \geq 35$ nm, which is more than five orders of magnitude more stringent than the limits from all combined reactor oscillation experiments. These results have wide-reaching implications in several areas including quantum coherence, the nature of spatial localization at sub-atomic scales, interpretation of neutrino physics data, and the potential reach of future large-scale experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The injective norm is a natural generalization to tensors of the operator norm of a matrix. In quantum information, the injective norm is one important measure of genuine multipartite entanglement of quantum states, where it is known as the geometric entanglement. In this paper, we give a high-probability upper bound on the injective norm of real and complex Gaussian random tensors, corresponding to a lower bound on the geometric entanglement of random quantum states, and to a bound on the ground-state energy of a particular multispecies spherical spin glass model. For some cases of our model, previous work used $\epsilon$-net techniques to identify the correct order of magnitude; in the present work, we use the Kac--Rice formula to give a one-sided bound on the constant which we believe to be tight.</description>

      <title>Lie-algebraic K\"ahler sigma models with the U(1) isotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss various questions which emerge in connection with the Lie-algebraic deformation of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model in two dimensions. First we supersymmetrize the original model endowing it with the minimal ${\cal N}=(0,2)$ and extended ${\cal N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetries. Then we derive the general hypercurrent anomaly in the both cases. In the latter case this anomaly is one-loop but is somewhat different from the standard expressions one can find in the literature because the target manifold is non-symmetric. We also show how to introduce the twisted masses and the $\theta$ term, and study the BPS equation for instantons, in particular the value of the topological charge. Then we demonstrate that the second loop in the $\beta$ function of the non-supersymmetric Lie-algebraic sigma model is due to an infrared effect. To this end we use a supersymmetric regularization. We also conjecture that the above statement is valid for higher loops too, similar to the parallel phenomenon in four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills. In the second part of the paper we develop a special dimensional reduction -- namely, starting from the two-dimensional Lie-algebraic model we arrive at a quasi-exactly solvable quantum-mechanical problem of the Lam\'e type.</description>

Abstract: We show that a single polynomial entanglement measure is enough to verify equivalence between generic $n$-qubit states under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC). SLOCC operations may be represented geometrically by M\"obius transformations on the roots of the entanglement measure on the Bloch sphere. Moreover, we show how the roots of the 3-tangle measure classify 4-qubit generic states, and propose a method to obtain the normal form of a 4-qubit state which bypasses the possibly infinite iterative procedure.</description>

      <title>Contextuality without incompatibility</title>

Abstract: The existence of incompatible measurements is often believed to be a feature of quantum theory which signals its inconsistency with any classical worldview. To prove the failure of classicality in the sense of Kochen-Specker noncontextuality, one does indeed require sets of incompatible measurements. However, a more broadly applicable notion of classicality is the existence of a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. In particular, this notion can imply constraints on the representation of outcomes even within a single nonprojective measurement. We leverage this fact to demonstrate that measurement incompatibility is neither necessary nor sufficient for proofs of the failure of generalized noncontextuality. Furthermore, we show that every proof of the failure of generalized noncontextuality in a quantum prepare-measure scenario can be converted into a proof of the failure of generalized noncontextuality in a corresponding scenario with no incompatible measurements.</description>

      <title>Accessible fragments of generalized probabilistic theories, cone equivalence, and applications to witnessing nonclassicality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formalism of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) was originally developed as a way to characterize the landscape of conceivable physical theories. Thus, the GPT describing a given physical theory necessarily includes all physically possible processes. We here consider the question of how to provide a GPT-like characterization of a particular experimental setup within a given physical theory. We show that the resulting characterization is not generally a GPT in and of itself-rather, it is described by a more general mathematical object that we introduce and term an accessible GPT fragment. We then introduce an equivalence relation, termed cone equivalence, between accessible GPT fragments (and, as a special case, between standard GPTs). We give a number of examples of experimental scenarios that are best described using accessible GPT fragments, and where moreover cone-equivalence arises naturally. We then prove that an accessible GPT fragment admits of a classical explanation if and only if every other fragment that is cone-equivalent to it also admits of a classical explanation. Finally, we leverage this result to prove several fundamental results regarding the experimental requirements for witnessing the failure of generalized noncontextuality. In particular, we prove that neither incompatibility among measurements nor the assumption of freedom of choice is necessary for witnessing failures of generalized noncontextuality, and, moreover, that such failures can be witnessed even using arbitrarily inefficient detectors.</description>

      <title>A linear program for testing nonclassicality and an open-source implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well motivated method for demonstrating that an experiment resists any classical explanation is to show that its statistics violate generalized noncontextuality. We here formulate this problem as a linear program and provide an open-source implementation of it which tests whether or not any given prepare-measure experiment is classically-explainable in this sense. The input to the program is simply an arbitrary set of quantum states and an arbitrary set of quantum effects; the program then determines if the Born rule statistics generated by all pairs of these can be explained by a classical (noncontextual) model. If a classical model exists, it provides an explicit model. If it does not, then it computes the minimal amount of noise that must be added such that a model does exist, and then provides this model. We generalize all these results to arbitrary generalized probabilistic theories (and accessible fragments thereof) as well; indeed, our linear program is a test of simplex-embeddability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reversible computation has been proposed as a future paradigm for energy efficient computation, but so far few implementations have been realised in practice. Quantum circuits, running on quantum computers, are one construct known to be reversible. In this work, we provide a proof-of-principle of classical logical gates running on quantum technologies. In particular, we propose, and realise experimentally, Toffoli and Half-Adder circuits suitable for classical computation, using radiofrequency-controlled $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions in a macroscopic linear Paul-trap as qubits. We analyse the energy required to operate the logic gates, both theoretically and experimentally, with a focus on the control energy. We identify bottlenecks and possible improvements in future platforms for energetically-efficient computation, e.g., trap chips with integrated antennas and cavity QED. Our experimentally verified energetic model also fills a gap in the literature of the energetics of quantum information, and outlines the path for its detailed study, as well as its potential applications to classical computing.</description>

      <title>Contextuality with vanishing coherence and maximal robustness to dephasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06856v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized contextuality is a resource for a wide range of communication and information processing protocols. However, contextuality is not possible without coherence, and so can be destroyed by dephasing noise. Here, we explore the robustness of contextuality to partially dephasing noise in a scenario related to state discrimination (for which contextuality is a resource). We find that a vanishing amount of coherence is sufficient to demonstrate the failure of noncontextuality in this scenario, and we give a proof of contextuality that is robust to arbitrary amounts of partially dephasing noise. This is in stark contrast to partially depolarizing noise, which is always sufficient to destroy contextuality.</description>

      <title>Detecting virtual photons in ultrastrongly coupled superconducting quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction and understanding the fundamental physics behind is essential for emerging quantum technologies. Solid-state devices may explore new regimes where coupling strengths are "ultrastrong", i.e., comparable to the energies of the subsystems. New exotic phenomena occur the common root of many of them being the fact that the entangled vacuum contains virtual photons. They herald the lack of conservation of the number of excitations which is the witness of ultrastrong coupling breaking the U(1) symmetry. Despite more than a decade of research, the detection of ground-state virtual photons still awaits demonstration. In this work, we recognize the "conspiring" set of experimental challenges and show how to overcome them, thus providing a solution to this long-standing problem. We find that combining a superinductor-based unconventional "light fluxonium" qudit and coherent control yields a highly efficient, faithful, and selective conversion of virtual photons into real ones. This enables their detection with resources available to present-day quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15217v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to entangle two cavity-magnon polaritons (CMPs) formed by two strongly coupled microwave cavity and magnon modes. This is realized by introducing vibration phonons, via magnetostriction, into the system that are dispersively coupled to the magnon mode. Stationary entanglement between two CMPs can be achieved when they are respectively resonant with the two sidebands of the drive field scattered by the phonons, and when the proportions of the cavity and magnon modes in the two polaritons are appropriately chosen. The entangled CMPs can improve the detection sensitivity in the dark matter search experiments using CMPs, and can also lead to the emission of frequency-entangled microwave photons.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Variational Quantum Algorithms with qBang: Efficiently Interweaving Metric and Momentum to Navigate Flat Energy Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a promising approach to utilizing current quantum computing infrastructures. VQAs are based on a parameterized quantum circuit optimized in a closed loop via a classical algorithm. This hybrid approach reduces the quantum processing unit load but comes at the cost of a classical optimization that can feature a flat energy landscape. Existing optimization techniques, including either imaginary time-propagation, natural gradient, or momentum-based approaches, are promising candidates but place either a significant burden on the quantum device or suffer frequently from slow convergence. In this work, we propose the quantum Broyden adaptive natural gradient (qBang) approach, a novel optimizer that aims to distill the best aspects of existing approaches. By employing the Broyden approach to approximate updates in the Fisher information matrix and combining it with a momentum-based algorithm, qBang reduces quantum-resource requirements while performing better than more resource-demanding alternatives. Benchmarks for the barren plateau, quantum chemistry, and the max-cut problem demonstrate an overall stable performance with a clear improvement over existing techniques in the case of flat (but not exponentially flat) optimization landscapes. qBang introduces a new development strategy for gradient-based VQAs with a plethora of possible improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In physics, it is crucial to identify operational measurement procedures to give physical meaning to abstract quantities. There has been significant effort to define time operationally using quantum systems, but the same has not been achieved for space. Developing an operational procedure to obtain information about the location of a quantum system is particularly important for a theory combining general relativity and quantum theory, which cannot rest on the classical notion of spacetime. Here, we take a first step towards this goal, and introduce a model to describe an extended material quantum system working as a position measurement device. Such a "quantum ruler" is composed of $N$ harmonically interacting dipoles and serves as a (quantum) reference system for the position of another quantum system. We show that we can define a quantum measurement procedure corresponding to the "superposition of positions", and that by performing this measurement we can distinguish when the quantum system is in a coherent or incoherent superposition in the position basis. The model is fully relational, because the only meaningful variables are the relative positions between the ruler and the system, and the measurement is expressed in terms of an interaction between the measurement device and the measured system.</description>

Abstract: Computing the Casimir force and energy between objects is a classical problem of quantum theory going back to the 1940s. Several different approaches have been developed in the literature often based on different physical principles. Most notably a representation of the Casimir energy in terms of determinants of boundary layer operators makes it accessible to a numerical approach. In this paper, we first give an overview of the various methods and discuss the connection to the Krein-spectral shift function and computational aspects. We propose variants of Krylov subspace methods for the computation of the Casimir energy for large-scale problems and demonstrate Casimir computations for several complex configurations. This allows for Casimir energy calculation for large-scale practical problems and significantly speeds up the computations in that case.</description>

Abstract: The ground-state of an artificial atom ultrastrongly coupled to quantized modes is entangled and contains an arbitrary number of virtual photons. The problem of their detection has been raised since the very birth of the field but despite the theoretical efforts still awaits experimental demonstration. Recently experimental problems have been addressed in detail showing that they can be overcome by combining an unconventional design of the artificial atom with advanced coherent control. In this work we study a simple scheme of control-integrated continuous measurement which makes remarkably favourable the tradeoff between measurement efficiency and backaction showing that the unambiguous detection of virtual photons can be achieved within state-of-the art quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Understanding universal aspects of quantum dynamics is an unresolved problem in statistical mechanics. In particular, the spin dynamics of the 1D Heisenberg model were conjectured to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class based on the scaling of the infinite-temperature spin-spin correlation function. In a chain of 46 superconducting qubits, we study the probability distribution, $P(\mathcal{M})$, of the magnetization transferred across the chain's center. The first two moments of $P(\mathcal{M})$ show superdiffusive behavior, a hallmark of KPZ universality. However, the third and fourth moments rule out the KPZ conjecture and allow for evaluating other theories. Our results highlight the importance of studying higher moments in determining dynamic universality classes and provide key insights into universal behavior in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Approaching the long-time dynamics of non-Markovian open quantum systems presents a challenging task if the bath is strongly coupled. Recent proposals address this problem through a representation of the so-called process tensor in terms of a tensor network. We show that for Gaussian environments highly efficient contraction to matrix product operator (MPO) form can be achieved with infinite MPO evolution methods, leading to significant computational speed-up over existing proposals. The result structurally resembles open system evolution with carefully designed auxiliary degrees of freedom, as in hierarchical or pseudomode methods. Here, however, these degrees of freedom are generated automatically by the MPO evolution algorithm. Moreover, the semi-group form of the resulting propagator enables us to explore steady-state physics, such as phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement forging based variational algorithms leverage the bi-partition of quantum systems for addressing ground state problems. The primary limitation of these approaches lies in the exponential summation required over the numerous potential basis states, or bitstrings, when performing the Schmidt decomposition of the whole system. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new method for entanglement forging employing generative neural networks to identify the most pertinent bitstrings, eliminating the need for the exponential sum. Through empirical demonstrations on systems of increasing complexity, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable or superior performance compared to the existing standard implementation of entanglement forging. Moreover, by controlling the amount of required resources, this scheme can be applied to larger, as well as non permutation invariant systems, where the latter constraint is associated with the Heisenberg forging procedure. We substantiate our findings through numerical simulations conducted on spins models exhibiting one-dimensional ring, two-dimensional triangular lattice topologies, and nuclear shell model configurations.</description>

      <title>Separability criterion using one observable for special states: Entanglement detection via quantum quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting entanglement in many-body quantum systems is crucial but challenging, typically requiring multiple measurements. Here, we establish the class of states where measuring connected correlations in just $\textit{one}$ basis is sufficient and necessary to detect bipartite separability, provided the appropriate basis and observables are chosen. This methodology leverages prior information about the state, which, although insufficient to reveal the complete state or its entanglement, enables our one basis approach to be effective. We discuss the possibility of one observable entanglement detection in a variety of systems, including those without conserved charges, such as the Transverse Ising model, reaching the appropriate basis via quantum quench. This provides a much simpler pathway of detection than previous works. It also shows improved sensitivity from Pearson Correlation detection techniques.</description>

      <title>Engineering the impact of phonon dephasing on the coherence of a WSe$_{2}$ single-photon source via cavity quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emitter dephasing is one of the key issues in the performance of solid-state single photon sources. Among the various sources of dephasing, acoustic phonons play a central role in adding decoherence to the single photon emission. Here, we demonstrate, that it is possible to tune and engineer the coherence of photons emitted from a single WSe$_2$ monolayer quantum dot via selectively coupling it to a spectral cavity resonance. We utilize an open cavity to demonstrate spectral enhancement, leveling, and suppression of the highly asymmetric phonon sideband, finding excellent agreement with a microscopic description of the exciton-phonon dephasing in a truly two-dimensional system. Moreover, the impact of cavity tuning on the dephasing is directly assessed via optical interferometry, which points out the capability to utilize light-matter coupling to steer and design dephasing and coherence of quantum emitters in atomically thin crystals.</description>

      <title>Error mitigation, optimization, and extrapolation on a trapped ion testbed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) trapped-ion devices are subject to errors which can significantly impact the accuracy of calculations if left unchecked. A form of error mitigation called zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) can decrease an algorithm's sensitivity to these errors without increasing the number of required qubits. Here, we explore different methods for integrating this error mitigation technique into the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for calculating the ground state of the HeH+ molecule at 0.8 Angstrom in the presence of realistic noise. Using the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT) trapped-ion device, we test three methods of scaling noise for extrapolation: time-stretching the two-qubit gates, scaling the sideband amplitude parameter, and inserting two-qubit gate identity operations into the ansatz circuit. We find time-stretching and sideband amplitude scaling fail to scale the noise on our particular hardware in a way that can be directly extrapolated to zero noise. Scaling our noise with global gate identity insertions and extrapolating after variational optimization, we achieve an estimate of the ground state energy within -0.004 +- 0.04 Hartree; outside chemical accuracy, but greatly improved over our non-error-mitigated estimate with error 0.127 +- 0.008 Hartree. Our results show that the efficacy of this error mitigation technique depends on choosing the correct implementation for a given device architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09343v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately solving the Schr\"odinger equation for intricate systems remains a prominent challenge in physical sciences. A paradigm-shifting approach to address this challenge involves the application of artificial intelligence techniques. In this study, we introduce a machine-learning model named QiankunNet, based on the transformer architecture employed in language models. By incorporating the attention mechanism, QiankunNet adeptly captures intricate quantum correlations, which enhances its expressive power. The autoregressive attribute of QiankunNet allows for the adoption of an exceedingly efficient sampling technique to estimate the total energy, facilitating the model training process. Additionally, performance of QiankunNet can be further improved via a pre-training process. This work not only demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence in quantum mechanics but also signifies a pivotal advancement in extending the boundary of systems which can be studied with a full-configuration-interaction accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of quantum mechanical angular momentum, based on spatial wavefunctions that depend on the Euler angles $\phi, \theta, \chi$. The wavefunctions are Wigner D-functions, $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$, for which the body-fixed projection quantum number $n$ has the unusual value $n=|j|=\sqrt{j(j+1)}$, or $n=0$. The $D_{\sqrt{j(j+1)},m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ wavefunctions are unnormalizable, however we demonstrate a renormalization procedure that allows the calculation of expectation values: for example, the states $D_{\sqrt{S(S+1)} M}^S (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ of elementary particles with spin $S$ give a gyromagnetic ratio of $g=2$ for $S&gt;0$, and we identify these as the spatial angular-momentum wavefunctions of known fundamental charged particles with spin. Therefore, we make the case that the $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ are useful as spatial wavefunctions for angular momentum. Some implications of the quantum number $n$ for fundamental particles are discussed, such as the proposed Dirac-fermion nature of the neutrino, and some proposed dark-matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Efficient two-qutrit gates in superconducting circuits using parametric coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in the demonstration of single qutrit and coupled qutrit gates with superconducting circuits. Coupled qutrit gates have significantly lower fidelity than single qutrit gates, owing to long implementation times. We present a protocol to implement the CZ universal gate for two qutrits based on a decomposition involving two partial state swaps and local operations. The partial state swaps can be implemented effectively using parametric coupling, which is fast and has the advantage of frequency selectivity. We perform a detailed analysis of this protocol in a system consisting of two fixed-frequency transmons coupled by a flux-tunable transmon. The application of an AC flux in the tunable transmon controls the parametric gates. This protocol has the potential to lead to fast and scalable two-qutrit gates in superconducting circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Form of Contextuality Predicting Probabilistic Equivalence between Two Sets of Three Mutually Noncommuting Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a contextual quantum system comprising mutually complementary observables organized into two or more collections of pseudocontexts with the same probability sums of outcomes. These pseudocontexts constitute non-orthogonal bases within the Hilbert space, featuring a state-independent sum of probabilities. In other words, regardless of the initial state preparation, the total probability remains constant but may be distinct from unity. The measurement contextuality in this setup arises from the quantum realizations of the hypergraph, which adhere to a specific bound on the linear combination of probabilities. In contrast, classical realizations can surpass this bound. The violation of quantum bounds stems from the inability of classical ontological models, specifically the set-theoretic representation of the hypergraph corresponding to the quantum observables' collections, to adhere to and explain the observed statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a novel (interpretation of) quantum theory, which I will call Environmental Determinacy-based or EnD Quantum Theory (EnDQT). In contrast to the well-known quantum theories, EnDQT has the benefit of not adding hidden variables, and it is not in tension with relativistic causality by providing a local causal explanation of quantum correlations without measurement outcomes varying according to, for example, systems or worlds. It is conservative, and so unlike theories such as spontaneous collapse theories, no modifications of the fundamental equations of quantum theory are required to establish when determinate values arise, and in principle, arbitrary systems can be in a superposition for an arbitrary amount of time. According to EnDQT, some systems acquire determinate values at some point, and the capacity to have and give rise to determinate values through interactions propagates to other systems via local interactions. When systems are isolated from the systems that belong to these chains of interactions, they can, in principle, evolve unitarily indefinitely. EnDQT provides a series of novel empirical posits that may distinguish it from other interpretations of quantum theory. Furthermore, via its characterization of the systems that start these chains of interactions, it provides possible payoffs to other areas of physics and their foundations, such as cosmology, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Colour centres in silicon carbide emerge as a promising semiconductor quantum technology platform with excellent spin-optical coherences.However, recent efforts towards maximising the photonic efficiency via integration into nanophotonic structures proved to be challenging due to reduced spectral stabilities. Here, we provide a large-scale systematic investigation on silicon vacancy centres in thin silicon carbide membranes with thicknesses down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$. Our membrane fabrication process involves a combination of chemical mechanical polishing, reactive ion etching, and subsequent annealing. This leads to highly reproducible membranes with roughness values of $3-4\,\rm\r{A}$, as well as negligible surface fluorescence. We find that silicon vacancy centres show close-to lifetime limited optical linewidths with almost no signs of spectral wandering down to membrane thicknesses of $0.7 \,\rm\mu m$. For silicon vacancy centres in thinner membranes down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$, we observe spectral wandering, however, optical linewidths remain below $200\,\rm MHz$, which is compatible with spin-selective excitation schemes. Our work clearly shows that silicon vacancy centres can be integrated into sub-micron silicon carbide membranes, which opens the avenue towards obtaining the necessary improvements in photon extraction efficiency based on nanophotonic structuring.</description>

Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the generation of enhanced optical springs using the optical Kerr effect. A nonlinear optical crystal is inserted into a Fabry-Perot cavity with a movable mirror, and a chain of second-order nonlinear optical effects in the phase-mismatched condition induces the Kerr effect. The optical spring constant is enhanced by a factor of $1.6\pm0.1$ over linear theory. To our knowledge, this is the first realization of optomechanical coupling enhancement using a nonlinear optical effect, which has been theoretically investigated to overcome the performance limitations of linear optomechanical systems. The tunable nonlinearity of demonstrated system has a wide range of potential applications, from observing gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star post-merger remnants to cooling macroscopic oscillators to their quantum ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shareability of quantum correlations among the constituent parties of a multiparty quantum system is restricted by the quantum information theoretic concept called monogamy. Depending on the multiparty quantum systems, different measures of quantum correlations show disparate signatures for monogamy. We characterize the shareability of quantum correlations, from both entanglement-separability and information-theoretic kinds, in a multiparty quantum spin system containing two- and three-body interactions with respect to its system parameters and external applied magnetic field. Monogamy score in this system exhibits both monogamous and non-monogamous traits depending on the quantum correlation measure, strengths of system parameters and external magnetic field. The percentage of non-monogamous states when the information-theoretic quantum correlations are considered is higher than that of the entanglement-separability kind in allowed ranges of these variables. The integral powers of the quantum correlation measures for which the non-monogamous states become monogamous are identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ongoing race towards experimental implementations of quantum error correction (QEC), finding ways to automatically discover codes and encoding strategies tailored to the qubit hardware platform is emerging as a critical problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been identified as a promising approach, but so far it has been severely restricted in terms of scalability. In this work, we significantly expand the power of RL approaches to QEC code discovery. Explicitly, we train an RL agent that automatically discovers both QEC codes and their encoding circuits for a given gate set, qubit connectivity and error model, from scratch. This is enabled by a reward based on the Knill-Laflamme conditions and a vectorized Clifford simulator, allowing us to scale our results to 20 physical qubits and distance 5 codes. Moreover, we introduce the concept of a noise-aware meta-agent, which learns to produce encoding strategies simultaneously for a range of noise models, thus leveraging transfer of insights between different situations. Our approach opens the door towards hardware-adapted accelerated discovery of QEC approaches across the full spectrum of quantum hardware platforms of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the semiclassical limit of a simple bosonic quantum many-body system exhibiting both integrable and chaotic behavior. A classical Hamiltonian is derived using coherent states. The transition from regularity to chaos in classical dynamics is visualized through Poincar\'e sections. Classical trajectories in phase space closely resemble the projections of the Husimi functions of eigenstates with similar energy, even in chaotic cases. It is demonstrated that this correlation is more evident when projecting the eigenstates onto the Fock states. The analysis is carried out at a critical energy where the eigenstates are maximally delocalized in the Fock basis. Despite the imperfect delocalization, its influence is present in the classical and quantum properties under investigation. The study systematically establishes quantum-classical correspondence for a bosonic many-body system with more than two wells, even within the chaotic region.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing non-Hermitian Many-Body Localization and Quantum Chaos via Singular Value Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong local disorder in interacting quantum spin chains can turn delocalized eigenmodes into localized eigenstates, giving rise to many-body localized (MBL) phases. This is accompanied by distinct spectral statistics: chaotic for the delocalized phase and integrable for the localized phase. In isolated systems, localization and chaos are defined through a web of relations among eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and real-time dynamics. These may change as the system is made open. We ask whether random dissipation (without random disorder) can induce chaotic or localized behavior in an otherwise integrable system. The dissipation is described using non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which can effectively be obtained from Markovian dynamics conditioned on null measurement. Through the use of the singular value decomposition and the introduction of new diagnostic tools complementing the singular-value statistics, namely, the singular form factor, the inverse participation ratio, and entanglement entropy for singular vectors, we provide a positive answer. Our method is illustrated in an XXZ Hamiltonian with random local dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the Fleming-Viot stochastic process, we propose a parallel implementation of variational quantum algorithms with the aim of helping the algorithm get out of barren plateaus, where optimization direction is unclear. In the Fleming-Viot tradition, parallel searches are called particles. In our proposed approach, the search by a Fleming-Viot particle is stopped when it encounters a region where the gradient is too small or noisy, suggesting a barren plateau area. The stopped particle continues the search after being regenerated at another location of the parameter space, potentially taking the exploration away from barren plateaus. We first analyze the behavior of the Fleming-Viot particles from a theoretical standpoint. We show that, when simulated annealing optimizers are used as particles, the Fleming-Viot system is expected to find the global optimum faster than a single simulated annealing optimizer, with a relative efficiency that increases proportionally to the percentage of barren plateaus in the domain. This result is backed up by numerical experiments carried out on synthetic problems as well as on instances of the Max-Cut problem, which show that our method performs better than plain simulated annealing when large barren plateaus are present in the domain.</description>

      <title>Passive and Deterministic Controlled-phase Gate for Single-photon Wavepackets Based on Time-reversal Symmetric Photon Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10719v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the construction of a passive, deterministic and near-unity-fidelity controlled-$\pi$-phase gate for single-photon wavepackets with a node comprising a two-level emitter and a small number of cavities. The proposed gate is rooted in the concept of time-reversal symmetric photon transport, which makes the entire photon transport process into a perfect absorption and re-emission process. Consequently, it can circumvent the longstanding issue of wavepacket distortion inherent in photonic phase gates employing nonlinear media. Moreover, such time-reversal symmetric transport ensures the nonlinear $\pi$ phase shift by a single two-level emitter for the two-photon case. We develop analytical solutions to reveal the temporal dynamics of the nonlinear photon transport and to optimize the gate structure. Notably, the gate fidelity can exceed 99\% for a node with only four cavities for both single-photon and two-photon operations. Moreover, the proposed gate architecture is compatible with the platforms of integrated photonics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) in the current NISQ era is still limited in size and precision. Hybrid applications mitigating those shortcomings are prevalent to gain early insight and advantages. Hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) comprises both the application of QC to improve machine learning (ML) and ML to improve QC architectures. This work considers the latter, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the search for viable quantum architectures, which we formalize by a set of generic challenges. Furthermore, we propose a concrete framework, formalized as a Markov decision process, to enable learning policies capable of controlling a universal set of continuously parameterized quantum gates. Finally, we provide benchmark comparisons to assess the shortcomings and strengths of current state-of-the-art RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>High fidelity control of a many-body Tonks--Girardeau gas with an effective mean-field approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) are powerful tools that can be used to control quantum systems with high fidelity. They work particularly well for single particle and non-interacting systems which can be described exactly and which possess invariant or self-similar dynamics. However, finding an exact STA for strongly correlated many-body systems can be difficult, as their complex dynamics may not be easily described, especially for larger systems that do not possess self-similar solutions. Here, we design STAs for one-dimensional bosonic gas in the Tonks--Girardeau limit by using a mean-field approach that succinctly captures the strong interaction effects through a quintic nonlinear term in the Schr\"odinger equation. We show that for the case of the harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent trap frequency the mean-field approach works exactly and recovers the well-known STA from literature. To highlight the robustness of our approach we also show that it works effectively for anharmonic potentials, achieving higher fidelities than other typical control techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms in a Superposition of Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to revolutionize our ability to process information. The advancement from classical to quantum computing is a product of our advancement from classical to quantum physics -- the more our understanding of the universe grows, so does our ability to use it for computation. A natural question that arises is, what will physics allow in the future? Can more advanced theories of physics increase our computational power, beyond quantum computing?
  An active field of research in physics studies theoretical phenomena outside the scope of explainable quantum mechanics, that form when attempting to combine Quantum Mechanics (QM) with General Relativity (GR) into a unified theory of Quantum Gravity (QG). QG is known to present the possibility of a quantum superposition of causal structure and event orderings. In the literature of quantum information theory, this translates to a superposition of unitary evolution orders.
  In this work we show a first example of a natural computational model based on QG, that provides an exponential speedup over standard quantum computation (under standard hardness assumptions). We define a model and complexity measure for a quantum computer that has the ability to generate a superposition of unitary evolution orders, and show that such computer is able to solve in polynomial time two of the fundamental problems in computer science: The Graph Isomorphism Problem ($\mathsf{GI}$) and the Gap Closest Vector Problem ($\mathsf{GapCVP}$), with gap $O\left( n^{2} \right)$. These problems are believed by experts to be hard to solve for a regular quantum computer. Interestingly, our model does not seem overpowered, and we found no obvious way to solve entire complexity classes that are considered hard in computer science, like the classes $\mathbf{NP}$ and $\mathbf{SZK}$.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of the quantum Mpemba effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Mpemba effect from the perspective of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics by studying relaxation dynamics described by Davies maps. Starting from a state with coherences in the energy eigenbasis, we demonstrate that an exponential speedup to equilibrium will always occur if the state is transformed to a diagonal state in the energy eigenbasis, provided that the spectral gap of the generator is defined by a complex eigenvalue. When the transformed state has a higher non-equilibrium free energy, we argue using thermodynamic reasoning that this is a \textit{genuine} quantum Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we show how a unitary transformation on an initial state can always be constructed to yield the effect and demonstrate our findings by studying the dynamics of both the non-equilibrium free energy and the irreversible entropy production in single and multi-qubit examples.</description>

      <title>Magic-induced computational separation in entanglement theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement serves as a foundational pillar in quantum information theory, delineating the boundary between what is classical and what is quantum. The common assumption is that higher entanglement corresponds to a greater degree of 'quantumness'. However, this folk belief is challenged by the fact that classically simulable operations, such as Clifford circuits, can create highly entangled states. The simulability of these states raises a question: what are the differences between 'low-magic' entanglement, and 'high-magic' entanglement? We answer this question in this work with a rigorous investigation into the role of magic in entanglement theory. We take an operational approach to understanding this relationship by studying tasks such as entanglement estimation, distillation and dilution. This approach reveals that magic has surprisingly strong implications for entanglement. Specifically, we find a sharp operational separation that splits Hilbert space into two distinct phases: the entanglement-dominated (ED) phase and magic-dominated (MD) phase. Roughly speaking, ED states have entanglement that significantly surpasses their magic, while MD states have magic that dominates their entanglement. The competition between the two resources in these two phases induces a computational phase separation between them: there are sample- and time-efficient quantum algorithms for almost any entanglement task on ED states, while these tasks are provably computationally intractable in the MD phase. To demonstrate the power of our results beyond entanglement theory, we highlight the relevance of our findings in many-body physics and topological error correction. Additionally, we offer simple theoretical explanations for phenomenological observations made in previous numerical studies using ED-MD phases.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of logical qubits and repeated error correction with better-than-physical error rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The promise of quantum computers hinges on the ability to scale to large system sizes, e.g., to run quantum computations consisting of more than 100 million operations fault-tolerantly. This in turn requires suppressing errors to levels inversely proportional to the size of the computation. As a step towards this ambitious goal, we present experiments on a trapped-ion QCCD processor where, through the use of fault-tolerant encoding and error correction, we are able to suppress logical error rates to levels below the physical error rates. In particular, we entangled logical qubits encoded in the [[7,1,3]] code with error rates 9.8 times to 500 times lower than at the physical level, and entangled logical qubits encoded in a [[12,2,4]] code with error rates 4.7 times to 800 times lower than at the physical level, depending on the judicious use of post-selection. Moreover, we demonstrate repeated error correction with the [[12,2,4]] code, with logical error rates below physical circuit baselines corresponding to repeated CNOTs, and show evidence that the error rate per error correction cycle, which consists of over 100 physical CNOTs, approaches the error rate of two physical CNOTs. These results signify an important transition from noisy intermediate scale quantum computing to reliable quantum computing, and demonstrate advanced capabilities toward large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum metrology leverages quantum correlations for enhanced parameter estimation. Recently, structured light enabled increased resolution and sensitivity in quantum metrology systems. However, lossy and complex setups impacting photon flux, hinder true quantum advantage while using high dimensional structured light. We introduce a straightforward mechanical rotation quantum sensing mechanism, employing high-dimensional structured light and a compact high-flux (45,000 coincidence counts per second) N00N state source with N=2. The system utilizes two opposite spiral phase plates with topological charge of up to l=16 that convert mechanical rotation into wavefront phase shifts, and exhibit a 16-fold enhanced super-resolution and 25-fold enhanced sensitivity between different topological charges, while retaining the acquisition times and with negligible change in coincidence count. Furthermore, the high photon flux enables to detect mechanical angular acceleration in real-time. Our approach paves the way for highly sensitive quantum measurements, applicable to various interferometric schemes.</description>

Abstract: We extend three related results from the analysis of influences of Boolean functions to the quantum setting, namely the KKL Theorem, Friedgut's Junta Theorem and Talagrand's variance inequality for geometric influences. Our results are derived by a joint use of recently studied hypercontractivity and gradient estimates. These generic tools also allow us to derive generalizations of these results in a general von Neumann algebraic setting beyond the case of the quantum hypercube, including examples in infinite dimensions relevant to quantum information theory such as continuous variables quantum systems. Finally, we comment on the implications of our results as regards to noncommutative extensions of isoperimetric type inequalities, quantum circuit complexity lower bounds and the learnability of quantum observables.</description>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms have the potential to enhance machine learning across a variety of domains and applications. In this work, we show how quantum machine learning can be used to improve financial forecasting. First, we use classical and quantum Determinantal Point Processes to enhance Random Forest models for churn prediction, improving precision by almost 6%. Second, we design quantum neural network architectures with orthogonal and compound layers for credit risk assessment, which match classical performance with significantly fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate that leveraging quantum ideas can effectively enhance the performance of machine learning, both today as quantum-inspired classical ML solutions, and even more in the future, with the advent of better quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a practical implementation of a universal quantum computer that uses local fermionic modes (LFM) rather than qubits. The device layout consists of quantum dots tunnel coupled by a hybrid superconducting island and a tunable capacitive coupling between the dots. We show that coherent control of Cooper pair splitting, elastic cotunneling, and Coulomb interactions allows us to implement the universal set of quantum gates defined by Bravyi and Kitaev. Due to the similarity with charge qubits, we expect charge noise to be the main source of decoherence. For this reason, we also consider an alternative design where the quantum dots have tunable coupling to the superconductor. In this second device design, we show that there is a sweetspot for which the local fermionic modes are charge neutral, making the device insensitive to charge noise effects. Finally, we compare both designs and their experimental limitations and suggest future efforts to overcome them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic systems provide a flexible platform where artificial lattices can be engineered in a reconfigurable fashion. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic arrays with engineered losses allow the realization of topological excitations stemming from non-Hermiticity and bulk mode criticality. We show that a generalized modulation of the local photonic losses allows the creation of topological modes both in the presence of periodicity and even in the quasiperiodic regime. We demonstrate that a localization transition of all the bulk photonic modes can be engineered in the presence of a quasiperiodic loss modulation, and we further demonstrate that such a transition can be created in the presence of both resonance frequency modulation and loss modulation. We finally address the robustness of this phenomenology to the presence of next to the nearest neighbor couplings and disorder in the emergence of criticality and topological modes. Our results put forward a strategy to engineer topology and criticality solely from engineered losses in a photonic system, establishing a potential platform to study the impact of nonlinearities in topological and critical photonic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. Among these, the paradigmatic Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the statistics of the works done in a forward out-of-equilibrium quantum process and in a corresponding backward one. In particular, the initial states of the two processes are thermal states and thus incoherent in the energy basis. Here, we aim to investigate the role of initial quantum coherence in work fluctuation theorems, by considering a quasiprobability distribution of work. To do this, we formulate and examine the implications of a detailed fluctuation theorem, which reproduces the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem in the absence of initial quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>From the Choi Formalism in Infinite Dimensions to Unique Decompositions of Generators of Completely Positive Dynamical Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any separable complex Hilbert space, any trace-class operator $B$ which does not have purely imaginary trace, and any generator $L$ of a norm-continuous one-parameter semigroup of completely positive maps we prove that there exists a unique bounded operator $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ is trace class and has vanishing trace, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. Central to our proof is a modified version of the Choi formalism which relates completely positive maps to positive semi-definite operators. We characterize when this correspondence is injective and surjective, respectively, which in turn explains why the proof idea of our main result cannot extend to non-separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.</description>

Abstract: We study closed universes in simple models of two dimensional gravity, such as Jackiw-Teiteilboim (JT) gravity coupled to matter, and a toy topological model that captures the key features of the former. We find there is a stark contrast, as well as some connections, between the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of the theory. We find rich semi-classical physics. However, when non-perturbative effects are included there is a unique closed universe state in each theory. We discuss possible meanings and interpretations of this observation.</description>

      <title>New Well-Posed Boundary Conditions for Semi-Classical Euclidean Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional Euclidean gravity in a finite cavity. Dirichlet conditions do not yield a well-posed elliptic system, and Anderson has suggested boundary conditions that do. Here we point out that there exists a one-parameter family of boundary conditions, parameterized by a constant $p$, where a suitably Weyl rescaled boundary metric is fixed, and all give a well-posed elliptic system. Anderson and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be seen as the limits $p \to 0$ and $\infty$ of these. Focussing on static Euclidean solutions, we derive a thermodynamic first law. Restricting to a spherical spatial boundary, the infillings are flat space or the Schwarzschild solution, and have similar thermodynamics to the Dirichlet case. We consider smooth Euclidean fluctuations about the flat space saddle; for $p &gt; 1/6$ the spectrum of the Lichnerowicz operator is stable -- its eigenvalues have positive real part. Thus we may regard large $p$ as a regularization of the ill-posed Dirichlet boundary conditions. However for $p &lt; 1/6$ there are unstable modes, even in the spherically symmetric and static sector. We then turn to Lorentzian signature. For $p &lt; 1/6$ we may understand this spherical Euclidean instability as being paired with a Lorentzian instability associated with the dynamics of the boundary itself. However, a mystery emerges when we consider perturbations that break spherical symmetry. Here we find a plethora of dynamically unstable modes even for $p &gt; 1/6$, contrasting starkly with the Euclidean stability we found. Thus we seemingly obtain a system with stable thermodynamics, but unstable dynamics, calling into question the standard assumption of smoothness that we have implemented when discussing the Euclidean theory.</description>

      <title>B\"ottcher-Wenzel inequality for weighted Frobenius norms and its application to quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing a weighted Frobenius norm with a positive matrix $\omega$, we introduce natural generalizations of the famous B\"ottcher-Wenzel (BW) inequality. Based on the combination of the weighted Frobenius norm $\|A\|_\omega := \sqrt{{\rm tr}(A^\ast A \omega)}$ and the standard Frobenius norm $\|A\| := \sqrt{{\rm tr}(A^\ast A)}$, there are exactly five possible generalizations, labeled (i) through (v), for the bounds on the norms of the commutator $[A,B]:= AB - BA$. In this paper, we establish the tight bounds for cases (iii) and (v), and propose conjectures regarding the tight bounds for cases (i) and (ii). Additionally, the tight bound for case (iv) is derived as a corollary of case (i). All these bounds (i)-(v) serve as generalizations of the BW inequality. The conjectured bounds for cases (i) and (ii) (and thus also (iv)) are numerically supported for matrices up to size $n=15$. Proofs are provided for $n=2$ and certain special cases. Interestingly, we find applications of these bounds in quantum physics, particularly in the contexts of the uncertainty relation and open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip: topology-induced symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains showcase exotic magnon excitations with non-trivial physical behavior, which is solely attributed to the real-space boundary condition even in the absence of local curvature effects. Counterintuitively, magnons on a M\"obius strip feature linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality even when the spin Hamiltonian preserves local rotational symmetry around the anisotropic easy axis. These linearly-polarized magnons form two non-degenerate branches that can neither be smoothly connected to nor be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons of opposite chirality commonly found in antiferromagnets. Only one branch supports standing-wave formation on the M\"obius strip while the other does not, owing to its spectral shift incurred by the boundary condition. By unraveling a hitherto unknown mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, our findings highlight the profound impact of real-space topology on the physical nature of not only magnons but also other bosonic quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>QDarts: A Quantum Dot Array Transition Simulator for finding charge transitions in the presence of finite tunnel couplings, non-constant charging energies and sensor dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present QDarts, an efficient simulator for realistic charge stability diagrams of quantum dot array (QDA) devices in equilibrium states. It allows for pinpointing the location of concrete charge states and their transitions in a high-dimensional voltage space (via arbitrary two-dimensional cuts through it), and includes effects of finite tunnel coupling, non-constant charging energy and a simulation of noisy sensor dots. These features enable close matching of various experimental results in the literature, and the package hence provides a flexible tool for testing QDA experiments, as well as opening the avenue for developing new methods of device tuning.</description>
