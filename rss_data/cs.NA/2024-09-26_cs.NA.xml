      <title>A minimizing movement approach for crystalline eikonal-curvature flows of spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for evolving spiral curves on a planar domain by normal velocities depending on the so-called crystalline curvatures. The algorithm uses a minimizing movement approach and relies on a special level set method for embedding the spirals. We present numerical simulations and comparisons demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed numerical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Extending Mercer's expansion to indefinite and asymmetric kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mercer's expansion and Mercer's theorem are cornerstone results in kernel theory. While the classical Mercer's theorem only considers continuous symmetric positive definite kernels, analogous expansions are effective in practice for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. In this paper we extend Mercer's expansion to continuous kernels, providing a rigorous theoretical underpinning for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. We begin by demonstrating that Mercer's expansion may not be pointwise convergent for continuous indefinite kernels, before proving that the expansion of continuous kernels with bounded variation uniformly in each variable separably converges pointwise almost everywhere, almost uniformly, and unconditionally almost everywhere. We also describe an algorithm for computing Mercer's expansion for general kernels and give new decay bounds on its terms.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for the Reduced Fracture Model via a Direct Filter Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical method that provides accurate real-time detection for the widths of the fractures in a fractured porous medium based on observational data on porous medium fluid mass and velocity. To achieve this task, an inverse problem is formulated by first constructing a forward formulation based on the reduced fracture model of the diffusion equation. A parameter estimation problem is then performed online by utilizing a direct filter method. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of our method in approximating the target parameters.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of iterative solution with inexact block preconditioning for weak Galerkin finite element approximation of Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the convergence of the iterative solution for the Stokes flow, discretized with the weak Galerkin finite element method and preconditioned using inexact block Schur complement preconditioning. The resulting saddle point linear system is singular and the pressure solution is not unique. The system is regularized with a commonly used strategy by specifying the pressure value at a specific location. It is analytically shown that the regularized system is nonsingular but has an eigenvalue approaching zero as the fluid kinematic viscosity tends to zero. Inexact block diagonal and triangular Schur complement preconditioners are considered with the minimal residual method (MINRES) and the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES), respectively. For both cases, the bounds are obtained for the eigenvalues of the preconditioned systems and for the residual of MINRES/GMRES. These bounds show that the convergence factor of MINRES/GMRES is almost independent of the viscosity parameter and mesh size while the number of MINRES/GMRES iterations required to reach convergence depends on the parameters only logarithmically. The theoretical findings and effectiveness of the preconditioners are verified with two- and three-dimensional numerical examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the finite difference approximation of the fractional Laplace operator in conjunction with a neural network method for solving it. We discretized the fractional Laplace operator using the Riemann-Liouville formula relevant to fractional equations. A shallow neural network was constructed to address the discrete fractional operator, coupled with the OGA algorithm. To validate the feasibility of our approach, we conducted numerical experiments, testing both the Laplace operator and the fractional Laplace operator, yielding favorable convergence results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a numerical method for determining the potential in one and two dimensional fractional Calder\'{o}n problems with a single measurement. Finite difference scheme is employed to discretize the fractional Laplacian, and the parameter reconstruction is formulated into a variational problem based on Tikhonov regularization to obtain a stable and accurate solution. Conjugate gradient method is utilized to solve the variational problem. Moreover, we also provide a suggestion to choose the regularization parameter. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the developed method and verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse problems about fractional Calder\'on problem and fractional Schr\"odinger equations are of interest in the study of mathematics. In this paper, we propose the inverse problem to simultaneously reconstruct potentials and sources for fractional Schr\"odinger equations with internal source terms. We show the uniqueness for reconstructing the two terms under measurements from two different nonhomogeneous boundary conditions. By introducing the variational Tikhonov regularization functional, numerical method based on conjugate gradient method(CGM) is provided to realize this inverse problem. Numerical experiments are given to gauge the performance of the numerical method.</description>

      <title>The Detection and Correction of Silent Errors in Pipelined Krylov Subspace Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As computational machines are becoming larger and more complex, the probability of hardware failure rises. ``Silent errors'', or, bit flips, may not be immediately apparent but can cause detrimental effects to algorithm behavior. In this work, we examine an algorithm-based approach to silent error detection in the context of pipelined Krylov subspace methods, in particular, Pipe-PR-CG, for the solution of linear systems. Our approach is based on using finite precision error analysis to bound the differences between quantities which should be equal in exact arithmetic. Through inexpensive monitoring during the iteration, we can detect when these bounds are violated, which indicates that a silent error has occurred. We use this approach to develop a fault-tolerance variant and also suggest a strategy for dynamically adapting the detection criteria. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Gripenberg-like algorithm for the lower spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an extended algorithm for computing the lower spectral radius of finite, non-negative matrix sets. Given a set of matrices $\mathcal{F} = \{A_1, \ldots, A_m\}$, the lower spectral radius represents the minimal growth rate of sequences in the product semigroup generated by $\mathcal{F}$. This quantity is crucial for characterizing optimal stable trajectories in discrete dynamical systems of the form $x_{k+1} = A_{i_k} x_k$, where $A_{i_k} \in \mathcal{F}$ for all $k \ge 0$. For the well-known joint spectral radius (which represents the highest growth rate), a famous algorithm providing suitable lower and upper bounds and able to approximate the joint spectral radius with arbitrary accuracy was proposed by Gripenberg in 1996. For the lower spectral radius, where a lower bound is not directly available (contrarily to the joint spectral radius), this computation appears more challenging.
  Our work extends Gripenberg's approach to the lower spectral radius computation for non-negative matrix families. The proposed algorithm employs a time-varying antinorm and demonstrates rapid convergence. Its success is related to the property that the lower spectral radius can be obtained as a Gelfand limit, which was recently proved in Guglielmi and Zennaro (2020). Additionally, we propose an improvement to the classical Gripenberg algorithm for approximating the joint spectral radius of arbitrary matrix sets.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to a Feynman-Kac formula for general nonlinear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations. Our formulation integrates both the Fisk-Stratonovich and It\^o integrals within the framework of backward stochastic differential equations. Utilizing this Feynman-Kac representation, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for numerical approximation. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, and a convergence analysis is provided to support the results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modelling of Elasticity Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for the probabilistic modelling of random fourth order material tensor fields, with a focus on tensors that are physically symmetric and positive definite (SPD), of which the elasticity tensor is a prime example. Given the critical role that spatial symmetries and invariances play in determining material behaviour, it is essential to incorporate these aspects into the probabilistic description and modelling of material properties. In particular, we focus on spatial point symmetries or invariances under rotations, a classical subject in elasticity. Following this, we formulate a stochastic modelling framework using a Lie algebra representation via a memoryless transformation that respects the requirements of positive definiteness and invariance. With this, it is shown how to generate a random ensemble of elasticity tensors that allows an independent control of strength, eigenstrain, and orientation. The procedure also accommodates the requirement to prescribe specific spatial symmetries and invariances for each member of the whole ensemble, while ensuring that the mean or expected value of the ensemble conforms to a potentially 'higher' class of spatial invariance. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the set of SPD tensors forms a differentiable manifold, which geometrically corresponds to an open cone within the ambient space of symmetric tensors. Thus, we explore the mathematical structure of the underlying sample space of such tensors, and introduce a new distance measure or metric, called the 'elasticity metric', between the tensors.</description>

      <title>Learning phase-space flows using time-discrete implicit Runge-Kutta PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for obtaining multidimensional phase-space solutions of systems of non-linear coupled differential equations, using high-order implicit Runge-Kutta Physics- Informed Neural Networks (IRK-PINNs) schemes. Building upon foundational work originally solving differential equations for fields depending on coordinates [J. Comput. Phys. 378, 686 (2019)], we adapt the scheme to a context where the coordinates are treated as functions. This modification enables us to efficiently solve equations of motion for a particle in an external field. Our scheme is particularly useful for explicitly time-independent and periodic fields. We apply this approach to successfully solve the equations of motion for a mass particle placed in a central force field and a charged particle in a periodic electric field.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with discontinuous stochastic gradient with applications to training of ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the convergence of the stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm to a target measure in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distance. Crucially, compared to the existing literature on SGHMC, we allow its stochastic gradient to be discontinuous. This allows us to provide explicit upper bounds, which can be controlled to be arbitrarily small, for the expected excess risk of non-convex stochastic optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradients, including, among others, the training of neural networks with ReLU activation function. To illustrate the applicability of our main results, we consider numerical experiments on quantile estimation and on several optimization problems involving ReLU neural networks relevant in finance and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the chemical, electric, and thermal transport as well as phase transitions and the accompanying mesoscale microstructure evolution within a material in an electronic device setting involves the solution of partial differential equations often with integral boundary conditions. Employing the familiar Poisson equation describing the electric potential evolution in a material exhibiting insulator-to-metal transitions, we exploit a special property of such an integral boundary condition, and we properly formulate the variational problem and establish its well-posedness. We then compare our method with the commonly-used Lagrange multiplier method that can also handle such boundary conditions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our new method achieves an optimal convergence rate in contrast to the conventional Lagrange multiplier method. Furthermore, the linear system derived from our method is symmetric positive definite, and can be efficiently solved by Conjugate Gradient method with algebraic multigrid preconditioning.</description>

      <title>Domain decomposition for data-driven reduced modeling of large-scale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the construction of accurate and predictive data-driven reduced models of large-scale numerical simulations with complex dynamics and sparse training datasets. In these settings, standard, single-domain approaches may be too inaccurate or may overfit and hence generalize poorly. Moreover, processing large-scale datasets typically requires significant memory and computing resources which can render single-domain approaches computationally prohibitive. To address these challenges, we introduce a domain decomposition formulation into the construction of a data-driven reduced model. In doing so, the basis functions used in the reduced model approximation become localized in space, which can increase the accuracy of the domain-decomposed approximation of the complex dynamics. The decomposition furthermore reduces the memory and computing requirements to process the underlying large-scale training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in a large-scale three-dimensional unsteady rotating detonation rocket engine simulation scenario with over $75$ million degrees of freedom and a sparse training dataset. Our results show that compared to the single-domain approach, the domain-decomposed version reduces both the training and prediction errors for pressure by up to $13 \%$ and up to $5\%$ for other key quantities, such as temperature, and fuel and oxidizer mass fractions. Lastly, our approach decreases the memory requirements for processing by almost a factor of four, which in turn reduces the computing requirements as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hutchinson's estimator is a randomized algorithm that computes an $\epsilon$-approximation to the trace of any positive semidefinite matrix using $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ matrix-vector products. An improvement of Hutchinson's estimator, known as Hutch++, only requires $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products. In this paper, we propose a generalization of Hutch++, which we call ContHutch++, that uses operator-function products to efficiently estimate the trace of any trace-class integral operator. Our ContHutch++ estimates avoid spectral artifacts introduced by discretization and are accompanied by rigorous high-probability error bounds. We use ContHutch++ to derive a new high-order accurate algorithm for quantum density-of-states and also show how it can estimate electromagnetic fields induced by incoherent sources.</description>

      <title>The Ensemble Kalman Filter for Dynamic Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inverse problems, the goal is to estimate unknown model parameters from noisy observational data. Traditionally, inverse problems are solved under the assumption of a fixed forward operator describing the observation model. In this article, we consider the extension of this approach to situations where we have a dynamic forward model, motivated by applications in scientific computation and engineering. We specifically consider this extension for a derivative-free optimizer, the ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). We introduce and justify a new methodology called dynamic-EKI, which is a particle-based method with a changing forward operator. We analyze our new method, presenting results related to the control of our particle system through its covariance structure. This analysis includes moment bounds and an ensemble collapse, which are essential for demonstrating a convergence result. We establish convergence in expectation and validate our theoretical findings through experiments with dynamic-EKI applied to a 2D Darcy flow partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction on adaptive curvilinear meshes with error based time stepping for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction (LWFR) is a single-stage, high order, quadrature free method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. This work extends the LWFR scheme to solve conservation laws on curvilinear meshes with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The scheme uses a subcell based blending limiter to perform shock capturing and exploits the same subcell structure to obtain admissibility preservation on curvilinear meshes. It is proven that the proposed extension of LWFR scheme to curvilinear grids preserves constant solution (free stream preservation) under the standard metric identities. For curvilinear meshes, linear Fourier stability analysis cannot be used to obtain an optimal CFL number. Thus, an embedded-error based time step computation method is proposed for LWFR method which reduces fine-tuning process required to select a stable CFL number using the wave speed based time step computation. The developments are tested on compressible Euler's equations, validating the blending limiter, admissibility preservation, AMR algorithm, curvilinear meshes and error based time stepping.</description>

      <title>A finite element method for anisotropic crystal growth on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transition problems on curved surfaces can lead to a panopticon of fascinating patterns. In this paper we consider finite element approximations of phase field models with a spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic surface energy density. The problems are either posed in $\mathbb R^3$ or on a two-dimensional hypersurface in $\mathbb R^3$. In the latter case, a fundamental choice regarding the anisotropic energy density has to be made. One possibility is to use a density defined in the ambient space $\mathbb R^3$. However, we propose and advocate for an alternative, where a density is defined on a fixed chosen tangent space, and is then moved along geodesics to the other tangent spaces. Our numerical method can be employed in all of the above situations, where for the problems on hypersurfaces the algorithm uses parametric finite elements. We prove an unconditional stability result for our schemes and present several numerical experiments, including for the modelling of ice crystal growth on a sphere.</description>

      <title>Mixed precision HODLR matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical matrix computations have attracted significant attention in the science and engineering community as exploiting data-sparse structures can significantly reduce the computational complexity of many important kernels. One particularly popular option within this class is the Hierarchical Off-Diagonal Low-Rank (HODLR) format. In this paper, we show that the off-diagonal blocks of HODLR matrices that are approximated by low-rank matrices can be represented in low precision without degenerating the quality of the overall approximation (with the error growth bounded by a factor of $2$). We also present an adaptive-precision scheme for constructing and storing HODLR matrices, and we prove that the use of mixed precision does not compromise the numerical stability of the resulting HOLDR matrix--vector product and LU factorization. That is, the resulting error in these computations is not significantly greater than the case where we use one precision (say, double) for constructing and storing the HODLR matrix. Our analyses further give insight on how one must choose the working precision in HODLR matrix computations relative to the approximation error in order to not observe the effects of finite precision. Intuitively, when a HOLDR matrix is subject to a high degree of approximation error, subsequent computations can be performed in a lower precision without detriment. We demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results through a range of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Applications of multiscale hierarchical decomposition to blind deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blind image deconvolution is a challenging, highly ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. We introduce a Multiscale Hierarchical Decomposition Method (MHDM) that is iteratively solving variational problems with adaptive data and regularization parameters, towards obtaining finer and finer details of the unknown kernel and image. We establish convergence of the residual in the noise-free data case, and then in the noisy data case when the algorithm is stopped early by means of a discrepancy principle. Fractional Sobolev norms are employed as regularizers for both kernel and image, with the advantage of computing the minimizers explicitly in a pointwise manner. In order to break the notorious symmetry occurring during each minimization step, we enforce a positivity constraint on the Fourier transform of the kernels. Numerical comparisons with a single-step variational method and a non-blind MHDM show that our approach produces comparable results, while less laborious parameter tuning is necessary at the price of more computations. Additionally, the scale decomposition of both reconstructed kernel and image provides a meaningful interpretation of the involved iteration steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.09545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph covers some recent advances in a range of acceleration techniques frequently used in convex optimization. We first use quadratic optimization problems to introduce two key families of methods, namely momentum and nested optimization schemes. They coincide in the quadratic case to form the Chebyshev method. We discuss momentum methods in detail, starting with the seminal work of Nesterov and structure convergence proofs using a few master templates, such as that for optimized gradient methods, which provide the key benefit of showing how momentum methods optimize convergence guarantees. We further cover proximal acceleration, at the heart of the Catalyst and Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient frameworks, using similar algorithmic patterns. Common acceleration techniques rely directly on the knowledge of some of the regularity parameters in the problem at hand. We conclude by discussing restart schemes, a set of simple techniques for reaching nearly optimal convergence rates while adapting to unobserved regularity parameters.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning Approach for Efficient Resource Allocation with Network Slicing in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to the resource allocation problem, aiming to coordinate multiple independent x-applications (xAPPs) for network slicing and resource allocation in the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN). Our approach maximizes the weighted throughput among user equipment (UE) and allocates physical resource blocks (PRBs). We prioritize two service types: enhanced Mobile Broadband and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication. Two xAPPs have been designed to achieve this: a power control xAPP for each UE and a PRB allocation xAPP. The method consists of a two-part training phase. The first part uses supervised learning with a Variational Autoencoder trained to regress the power transmission, UE association, and PRB allocation decisions, and the second part uses unsupervised learning with a contrastive loss approach to improve the generalization and robustness of the model. We evaluate the performance by comparing its results to those obtained from an exhaustive search and deep Q-network algorithms and reporting performance metrics for the regression task. The results demonstrate the superior efficiency of this approach in different scenarios among the service types, reaffirming its status as a more efficient and effective solution for network slicing problems compared to state-of-the-art methods. This innovative approach not only sets our research apart but also paves the way for exciting future advancements in resource allocation in O-RAN.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetric schemes for stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift: an unadjusted Barker algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new simple and explicit numerical scheme for time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations. The scheme is based on sampling increments at each time step from a skew-symmetric probability distribution, with the level of skewness determined by the drift and volatility of the underlying process. We show that as the step-size decreases the scheme converges weakly to the diffusion of interest, and also prove path-wise accuracy in a particular setting. We then consider the problem of simulating from the limiting distribution of an ergodic diffusion process using the numerical scheme with a fixed step-size. We establish conditions under which the numerical scheme converges to equilibrium at a geometric rate, and quantify the bias between the equilibrium distributions of the scheme and of the true diffusion process. Notably, our results do not require a global Lipschitz assumption on the drift, in contrast to those required for the Euler--Maruyama scheme for long-time simulation at fixed step-sizes. Our weak convergence result relies on an extension of the theory of Milstein \&amp; Tretyakov to stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift, which could also be of independent interest. We support our theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Computational analysis on a linkage between generalized logit dynamic and discounted mean field game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logit dynamics are dynamical systems describing transitions and equilibria of actions of interacting players under uncertainty. An uncertainty is embodied in logit dynamic as a softmax type function often called a logit function originating from a maximization problem subjected to an entropic penalization. This study provides another explanation for the generalized logit dynamic, particularly its logit function and player's heterogeneity, based on a discounted mean field game subjected to the costly decision making of a representative player. A large discount limit of the mean field game is argued to yield a logit dynamic. Further, mean field games that lead to classical and generalized logit dynamics are clarified and their well posedness is discussed. Additionally, numerical methods based on a finite difference discretization for computing generalized logit dynamics and corresponding mean field games are presented. Numerical methods are applied to two problems arising in the management of resources and environment; one involves an inland fisheries management problem with legal and illegal anglers, while the other is a sustainable tourism problem. Particularly, cases that possibly lack the regularity condition to be satisfied for the unique existence of stationary solutions are computationally discussed.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Error-Bounded Hierarchical Matrices for Efficient Neural Network Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dynamic, error-bounded hierarchical matrix (H-matrix) compression method tailored for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The proposed approach reduces the computational complexity and memory demands of large-scale physics-based models while preserving the essential properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). By adaptively refining hierarchical matrix approximations based on local error estimates, our method ensures efficient training and robust model performance. Empirical results demonstrate that this technique outperforms traditional compression methods, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), pruning, and quantization, by maintaining high accuracy and improving generalization capabilities. Additionally, the dynamic H-matrix method enhances inference speed, making it suitable for real-time applications. This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution for deploying PINNs in complex scientific and engineering domains, bridging the gap between computational feasibility and real-world applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive numerical analysis of centrifugal clutch systems integrated with a two-speed automatic transmission, a key component in automotive torque transfer. Centrifugal clutches enable torque transmission based on rotational speed without external controls. The study systematically examines various clutch configurations effects on transmission dynamics, focusing on torque transfer, upshifting, and downshifting behaviors under different conditions. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model predicts clutch engagement using parameters such as spring preload and shoe mass, offering an efficient alternative to complex simulations. The integration of deep learning and numerical modeling provides critical insights for optimizing clutch designs, enhancing transmission performance and efficiency.</description>
