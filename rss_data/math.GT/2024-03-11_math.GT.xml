      <title>Foam cobordism and the Sah-Arnoux-Fathi invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers where scissor congruence and K-theoretical invariants are related to cobordism groups of foams in various dimensions. A model example is provided where the cobordism group of weighted one-foams is identified, via the Sah-Arnoux-Fathi invariant, with the first homology of the group of interval exchange automorphisms and with the Zakharevich first K-group of the corresponding assembler. Several variations on this cobordism group are computed as well.</description>

      <title>Volume and topology of bounded and closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a compact, orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold whose boundary is a connected totally geodesic surface of genus $2$. If $N$ has Heegaard genus at least $5$, then its volume is greater than $2V_{\rm oct}$, where $V_{\rm oct}=3.66\ldots$ denotes the volume of a regular ideal hyperbolic octahedron in $\mathbb{H}^3$. This improves the lower bound given in our earlier paper ``Volume and topology of bounded and closed hyperbolic $3$-manifolds.'' One ingredient in the improved bound is that in a crucial case, instead of using a single ``muffin'' in $N$ in the sense of Kojima and Miyamoto, we use two disjoint muffins. By combining the result about manifolds with geodesic boundary with the $\log(2k-1)$ theorem and results due to Agol-Culler-Shalen and Shalen-Wagreich, we show that if $M$ is a closed, orientable hyperbolic $3$-manifold with $\mathop{\rm vol} M\le V_{\rm oct}/2$, then $\dim H_1(M;\mathbb{F}_2)\le4$. We also provide new lower bounds for the volumes of closed hyperbolic $3$-manifolds whose cohomology ring over $\mathbb{F}_2$ satisfies certain restrictions; these improve results that were proved in ``Volume and topology$\ldots$.''</description>

      <title>Homogeneous quandles with abelian inner automorphism groups and vertex-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quandle is an algebraic system originated in knot theory, and can be regarded as a generalization of symmetric spaces. The inner automorphism group of a quandle is defined as the group generated by the point symmetries (right multiplications). In this paper, starting from any simple graphs, we construct quandles whose inner automorphism groups are abelian. We also prove that the constructed quandle is homogeneous if and only if the graph is vertex-transitive. This shows that there is a wide family of quandles with abelian inner automorphism groups, even if we impose the homogeneity. The key examples of such quandles are realized as subquandles of oriented real Grassmannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>On equivariant embeddings of hyperbolic surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of when a closed hyperbolic surface admits a totally geodesic embedding into a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, and in particular equivariant versions of such embeddings. In a previous paper we considered orientation-preserving actions on orientable surfaces, in the present paper actions of maximal possible order on nonorientable surfaces, and maximal orientation-reversing actions on orientable surfaces.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial p-th Calabi Flows for Total Geodesic Curvatures in hyperbolic background geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hyperbolic background geometry, we investigate a generalized circle packing (including circles, horocycles and hypercycles) with conical singularities on a surface with boundary, which has a total geodesic curvature on each generalized circle of this circle packing and a discrete Gaussian curvature on the center of each dual circle. The purpose of this paper is to find this type of circle packings with prescribed total geodesic curvatures on generalized circles and discrete Gaussian curvatures on centers of dual circles. To achieve this goal, we firstly establish existence and rigidity on this type of circle packings by the variational principle. Secondly, for $p&gt;1$, we introduce combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flows to find the circle packing with prescribed total geodesic curvatures on generalized circles and discrete Gaussian curvatures on centers of dual circles for the first time.</description>

      <title>On relative commutants of subalgebras in group and tracial crossed product von Neumann algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group acting on a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Given $x\in X$, and $\mu\in\text{Prob}(X)$, we introduce the notion of contraction of $\mu$ towards $x$ with respect to unitary elements of a group von Neumann algebra not necessarily coming from group elements. Using this notion, we study relative commutants of subalgebras in tracial crossed product von Neumann algebras. The results are applied to negatively curved groups and $\text{SL}(d,\mathbb{Z})$, $d \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of bundle diffeomorphism groups over a circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study boundedness of bundle diffeomorphism groups over a circle. For a fiber bundle $\pi : M \to S^1$ with fiber $N$ and structure group $\Gamma$ and $r \in {\Bbb Z}_{\geq 0} \cup \{ \infty \}$ we distinguish an integer $k = k(\pi, r) \in {\Bbb Z}_{\geq 0}$ and construct a function $\widehat{\nu} : {\rm Diff}_\pi(M)_0 \to {\Bbb R}_k$. When $k \geq 1$, it is shown that the bundle diffeomorphism group ${\rm Diff}_\pi(M)_0$ is uniformly perfect and $clb_\pi\,{\rm Diff}^r_\pi(M)_0 \leq k+3$, if ${\rm Diff}_{\rho, c}(E)_0$ is perfect for the trivial fiber bundle $\rho : E \to {\Bbb R}$ with fiber $N$ and structure group $\Gamma$. On the other hand, when $k = 0$, it is shown that $\widehat{\nu}$ is a unbounded quasimorphism, so that ${\rm Diff}_\pi(M)_0$ is unbounded and not uniformly perfect. We also describe the integer $k$ in term of the attaching map $\phi$ for a mapping torus $\pi : M_\phi \to S^1$ and give some explicit examples of (un)bounded groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the positivity conjecture on (Kauffman bracket) skein algebras to Roger--Yang skein algebras. To generalize it, we use explicit polynomials like Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind to give candidates of positive bases. Moreover, the polynomials form a lower bound in the sense of [L\^e18] and [LTY21]. We also discuss a relation between the polynomials and the centers of Roger--Yang skein algebras when the quantum parameter is a complex root of unity.</description>

      <title>Representations of braid groups via cyclic covers of the sphere: Zariski closure and arithmeticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d \geq 2$ and $n\geq 3$ be two natural numbers. Given any sequence $\kappa=(k_1,\dots,k_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\gcd(k_1,\dots,k_n,d)=1$, we consider the family of Riemann surfaces obtained from the plane curves defined by $y^d=\prod_{i=1}^n(x-b_i)^{k_i}$, where $\{b_1,\dots,b_n\}$ are $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{C}$. The monodromy of the cohomology of the fibers of this family provides us with a representation of the pure braid group $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into some symplectic group. By restricting to a specific subspace in the cohomology of the fibers, we obtain a representation $\rho_d$ of $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into a linear algebraic group defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. In a sense, $\rho_d$ is primitive with respect to the parameters $d$ and $\kappa$. The first main result of this paper is a criterion for the Zariski closure of the image of $\rho_d$ to be maximal, and the second main result is a criterion for the image to be an arithmetic lattice in the target group. The latter generalizes previous results of Venkataramana and gives an answer to a question by McMullen.</description>

      <title>Milnor's invariants for knots and links in closed orientable 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his 1957 paper, John Milnor introduced a collection of invariants for links in $S^3$ detecting higher-order linking phenomena by studying lower central quotients of link groups and comparing them to those of the unlink. These invariants, now known as Milnor's $\overline{\mu}$-invariants, were later shown to be topological link concordance invariants and have since inspired decades of consequential research. Milnor's invariants have many interpretations, and there have been numerous attempts to extend them to other settings. In this paper, we extend Milnor's invariants to topological concordance invariants of knots and links in general closed orientable 3-manifolds. These invariants unify and generalize all previous versions of Milnor's invariants in dimension 3, including Milnor's original invariants for links in $S^3$.</description>

      <title>Seifert surfaces in the four-ball and composition of binary quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use composition of binary quadratic forms to systematically create pairs of Seifert surfaces that are non-isotopic in the four-ball. Our main topological result employs Gauss composition to classify the pairs of binary quadratic forms that arise as the Seifert forms of pairs of disjoint Seifert surfaces of genus one. The main ingredient of the proof is number-theoretic and of independent interest. It establishes a new connection between the Bhargava cube and the geometric approach to Gauss composition via planes in the space of two-by-two matrices. In particular, we obtain a geometric recipe that given any two binary quadratic forms finds a Bhargava cube that gives rise to their composition.</description>

      <title>The Wrappingness and Trunkenness of Volume-Preserving Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Link invariants of long pieces of orbits of a volume-preserving flow can be used to define diffeomorphism invariants of the flow. In this paper, we extend the notions of wrapping number and trunk and define invariants of links with respect to a fibration on a 3-manifold. Extending work of Dehornoy and Rechtman, we apply this to define diffeomorphism invariants wrappingness and trunkenness of volume-preserving flows on 3-manifolds and interpret these invariants as obstructions to the existence of a global surface of section for the flow. Finally, we construct flows and show that wrappingness and trunkenness are not functions of the helicity of a flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study smooth complex quasi-projective surfaces whose fundamental group is a free product of cyclic groups. In particular, we prove the existence of an admissible map from the quasi-projective surface to a smooth complex quasi-projective curve. Associated with this result, we prove addition-deletion Lemmas for fibers of the admissible map which describe how these operations affect the fundamental group of the quasi-projective surface. Our methods also allow us to produce curves in smooth projective surfaces whose fundamental groups of their complements are free products of cyclic groups, generalizing classical results on $C_{p,q}$ curves and torus type projective sextics, and showing how general this phenomenon is.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Braided algebras are associative algebras endowed with a Yang-Baxter operator that satisfies certain compatibility conditions involving the multiplication. Along with Hochschild cohomology of algebras, there is also a notion of Yang-Baxter cohomology, which is associated to any Yang-Baxter operator. In this article, we introduce and study a cohomology theory for braided algebras in dimensions 2 and 3, that unifies Hochschild and Yang-Baxter cohomology theories. We show that its second cohomology group classifies infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras. We provide infinite families of examples of braided algebras, including Hopf algebras, tensorized multiple conjugation quandles, and braided Frobenius algebras. Moreover, we derive the obstructions to quadratic deformations, and show that these obstructions lie in the third cohomology group. Relations to Hopf algebra cohomology are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On the topology of fiber-type curves: a Zariski pair of affine nodal curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore conditions for a curve in a smooth projective surface to have a free product of cyclic groups as the fundamental group of its complement. It is known that if the surface is $\mathbb{P}^2$, then such curves must be of fiber type, i.e. a finite union of fibers of an admissible map onto a complex curve. In this setting, we exhibit an infinite family of Zariski pairs of fiber-type curves, that is, pairs of plane projective fiber-type curves whose tubular neighborhoods are homeomorphic, but whose embeddings in $\mathbb{P}^2$ are not. This includes a Zariski pair of curves in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with only nodes as singularities (and the same singularities at infinity) whose complements have non-isomorphic fundamental groups, one of them being free. Our examples show that the position of nodes also affects the topology of the embedding of fiber-type curves.</description>
