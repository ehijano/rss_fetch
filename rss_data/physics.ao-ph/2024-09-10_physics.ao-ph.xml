      <title>Vegetation-climate feedbacks across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vegetation often understood merely as the result of long-term climate conditions. However, vegetation itself plays a fundamental role in shaping Earth's climate by regulating the energy, water, and biogeochemical cycles across terrestrial landscapes. It exerts influence by altering surface roughness, consuming significant water resources through transpiration and interception, lowering atmospheric CO2 concentration, and controlling net radiation and its partitioning into sensible and latent heat fluxes. This influence propagates through the atmosphere, from microclimate scales to the entire atmospheric boundary layer, subsequently impacting large-scale circulation and the global transport of heat and moisture. Understanding the feedbacks between vegetation and atmosphere across multiple scales is crucial for predicting the influence of land use and cover changes and for accurately representing these processes in climate models. This short review aims to discuss the mechanisms through which vegetation modulates climate across spatial and temporal scales. Particularly, we evaluate the influence of vegetation on circulation patterns, precipitation and temperature, both in terms of trends and extreme events, such as droughts and heatwaves. The main goal is to highlight the state of science and review recent studies that may help advance our collective understanding of vegetation feedbacks and the role they play in climate.</description>

      <title>CAS-Canglong: A skillful 3D Transformer model for sub-seasonal to seasonal global sea surface temperature prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of global sea surface temperature at sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescale is critical for drought and flood forecasting, as well as for improving disaster preparedness in human society. Government departments or academic studies normally use physics-based numerical models to predict S2S sea surface temperature and corresponding climate indices, such as El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation. However, these models are hampered by computational inefficiencies, limited retention of ocean-atmosphere initial conditions, and significant uncertainty and biases. Here, we introduce a novel three-dimensional deep learning neural network to model the nonlinear and complex coupled atmosphere-ocean weather systems. This model incorporates climatic and temporal features and employs a self-attention mechanism to enhance the prediction of global S2S sea surface temperature pattern. Compared to the physics-based models, it shows significant computational efficiency and predictive capability, improving one to three months sea surface temperature predictive skill by 13.7% to 77.1% in seven ocean regions with dominant influence on S2S variability over land. This achievement underscores the significant potential of deep learning for largely improving forecasting skills at the S2S scale over land.</description>

      <title>Single-parameter effective dynamics of warm cloud precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud observables such as precipitation efficiency and cloud lifetime are key quantities in weather and climate, but understanding their quantitative connection to initial conditions such as initial cloud water mass or droplet size remains challenging. Here we study the evolution of cloud droplets with a bin microphysics scheme, modeling both gravitational coagulation as well as fallout, and develop analytical formulae to describe the evolution of bulk cloud and rain water. We separate the dynamics into a mass-conserving and fallout-dominated regime, which reveals that the overall dynamics are governed by a single non-dimensional parameter $\mu$, the ratio of accretion and sedimentation time scales. Cloud observables from the simulations accordingly collapse as a function of $\mu$. We also find an unexpected relationship between cloud water and accumulated rain, and that fallout can be modeled with a bulk fall speed which is constant in time despite an evolving raindrop distribution.</description>

      <title>Critical latitude in global quasi-geostrophic flow on a rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study geostrophic turbulence without external forcing or dissipation, using a Casimir-preserving numerical method. The research examines the formation of large zonal jets, common in geophysical flows, especially in giant gas planets. These jets form due to the east-west stretching of vortices, influenced by the gradient of the Coriolis parameter, leading to a critical latitude beyond which jets do not form.
  Using a global quasi-geostrophic model with a fully latitude-dependent Coriolis parameter, we investigate this critical latitude, which is theorized to depend only on the product of the Rossby number and the Lamb parameter. By simulating random flow fields, the critical latitude was identified through zonally averaged zonal velocity profiles.
  Results align with geostrophic theory, especially near typical Rossby and Lamb parameter values for Earth's atmosphere. However, in the regime of weak rotation (high Rossby numbers) and strong stratification (high Lamb values), no clear critical latitude emerges; instead, zonal jet amplitude and width decrease gradually towards the poles. This research paves the way for further study of jet dynamics under a fully latitude-dependent Coriolis parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution we report the on-going progresses of the project FATE, an operational automatic forecast system conceived to deliver forecasts of a set of astroclimatic and atmospheric parameters having the aim to support the science operations (i.e. the Service Mode) at the Very Large Telescope. The project has been selected at conclusion of an international open call for tender opened by ESO and it fits with precise technical specifications. In this contribution we will present the ultimate goals of this service once it will be integrated in the VLT operations, the forecasts performances at present time and the state of the art of the project. FATE is supposed to draw the roadmap towards the optical turbulence forecast for the ELT.</description>

      <title>Optical turbulence forecast for the European Solar Telescope (EST): the challenge of the day-time regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution we present preliminary results of a study applied to the Observatories of Roque de Los Muchachos (La Palma) and Teide (Tenerife) in Canary Islands aiming to investigate the possibility to implement an automatic system for the optical turbulence forecasting for the European Solar Telescope (EST) telescope. The study has been carried out in the context of the SOLARNET project and the two mentioned sites were the pre-selected sites for EST. This analysis aimed to investigate the possibility to extend the methodology of the forecast of the optical turbulence developed by our team and performed on top-class ground-based telescopes dedicated to night time observations such as ALTA (@ LBT) and FATE (@ VLT) to the day-time regime. As an ancillary output our very preliminary analysis concludes, that the two sites of Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (ORM) and Teide Observatory (TO) show comparable characteristics during the day time. Considering that the site of EST has been already identified to be at ORM this can be considered a very useful information from a scientific point of view.</description>

      <title>Using Generative Artificial Intelligence Creatively in the Classroom: Examples and Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although generative artificial intelligence (AI) is not new, recent technological breakthroughs have transformed its capabilities across many domains. These changes necessitate new attention from educators and specialized training within the atmospheric sciences and related fields. Enabling students to use generative AI effectively, responsibly, and ethically is critically important for their academic and professional preparation. Educators can also use generative AI to create engaging classroom activities, such as active learning modules and games, but must be aware of potential pitfalls and biases. There are also ethical implications in using tools that lack transparency, as well as equity concerns for students who lack access to more sophisticated paid versions of generative AI tools. This article is written for students and educators alike, particularly those who want to learn more about generative AI in education, including use cases, ethical concerns, and a brief history of its emergence. Sample user prompts are also provided across numerous applications in education and the atmospheric and related sciences. While we don't have solutions for some broader ethical concerns surrounding the use of generative AI in education, our goal is to start a conversation that could galvanize the education community around shared goals and values.</description>

      <title>Reynolds stress decay modeling informed by anisotropically forced homogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models for solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are popular tools for predicting complex turbulent flows due to their computational affordability and ability to provide or estimate quantities of engineering interest. However, results depend on a proper treatment of unclosed terms, which require progress in the development and assessment of model forms. In this study, we consider the Reynolds stress transport equations as a framework for second-moment turbulence closure modeling. We specifically focus on the terms responsible for decay of the Reynolds stresses, which can be isolated and evaluated separately from other terms in a canonical setup of homogeneous turbulence. We show that by using anisotropic forcing of the momentum equation, we can access states of turbulence traditionally not probed in a triply-periodic domain. The resulting data span a wide range of anisotropic turbulent behavior in a more comprehensive manner than extant literature. We then consider a variety of model forms for which these data allow us to perform a robust selection of model coefficients and select an optimal model that extends to cubic terms when expressed in terms of the principal coordinate Reynolds stresses. Performance of the selected decay model is then examined relative to the simulation data and popular models from the literature, demonstrating the superior accuracy of the developed model and, in turn, the efficacy of this framework for model selection and tuning.</description>

      <title>Ice viscosity governs hydraulic fracture that causes rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full thickness crevasses can transport water from the glacier surface to the bedrock where high water pressures can open kilometre-long cracks along the basal interface, which can accelerate glacier flow. We present a first computational modelling study that describes time-dependent fracture propagation in an idealised glacier causing rapid supraglacial lake drainage. A novel two-scale numerical method is developed to capture the elastic and viscoelastic deformations of ice along with crevasse propagation. The fluid-conserving thermo-hydro-mechanical model incorporates turbulent fluid flow and accounts for melting/refreezing in fractures. Applying this model to observational data from a 2008 rapid lake drainage event indicates that viscous deformation exerts a much stronger control on hydrofracture propagation compared to thermal effects. This finding contradicts the conventional assumption that elastic deformation is adequate to describe fracture propagation in glaciers over short timescales (minutes to several hours) and instead demonstrates that viscous deformation must be considered to reproduce observations of lake drainage rate and local ice surface elevation change. As supraglacial lakes continue expanding inland and as Greenland Ice Sheet temperatures become warmer than -8 degree C, our results suggest rapid lake drainages are likely to occur without refreezing, which has implications for the rate of sea level rise.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Evaluating PM2.5 Forecasts from the Perspective of Individual Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildfire frequency is increasing as the climate changes, and the resulting air pollution poses health risks. Just as people routinely use weather forecasts to plan their activities around precipitation, reliable air quality forecasts could help individuals reduce their exposure to air pollution. In the present work, we evaluate several existing forecasts of fine particular matter (PM2.5) within the continental United States in the context of individual decision-making. Our comparison suggests there is meaningful room for improvement in air pollution forecasting, which might be realized by incorporating more data sources and using machine learning tools. To facilitate future machine learning development and benchmarking, we set up a framework to evaluate and compare air pollution forecasts for individual decision making. We introduce a new loss to capture decisions about when to use mitigation measures. We highlight the importance of visualizations when comparing forecasts. Finally, we provide code to download and compare archived forecast predictions.</description>

      <title>Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in early numerical methods, whereas they are employed to an increasing extent in state of the art computational fluid dynamics codes, in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method. Here we consider a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results, with no significantly adverse effect on the computational cost of the simulation. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</description>

      <title>Project Severe Weather Archive of the Philippines (SWAP). Part 1: Establishing a Baseline Climatology for Severe Weather across the Philippine Archipelago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the rudimentary reporting methods and general lack of documentation, the creation of a severe weather database within the Philippines has been difficult yet relevant target for climatology purposes and historical interest. Previous online severe weather documentation i.e. of tornadoes, waterspouts, and hail events, has also often been few, inconsistent, inactive, or is now completely decommissioned. Several countries or continents support severe weather information through either government-sponsored or independent organizations. For this work, Project SWAP stands as a collaborative exercise, with clear data attribution and open avenues for augmentation, and the creation of a common data model to store the phenomenon's information will assist in maintaining and updating the aforementioned online archive in the Philippines. This paper presents the methods necessary for creating the SWAP database, provide broader climatological analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in severe weather occurrence within the Philippine context, and outline potential use cases for the data. We also highlight the project's current limitations as is to any other existing and far larger database, and emphasize the need for understanding these events' and their mesoscale environments, inline to the current severe weather climatologies across the globe.</description>

      <title>Pixels and Predictions: Potential of GPT-4V in Meteorological Imagery Analysis and Forecast Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI, such as OpenAI's GPT-4V large-language model, has rapidly entered mainstream discourse. Novel capabilities in image processing and natural-language communication may augment existing forecasting methods. Large language models further display potential to better communicate weather hazards in a style honed for diverse communities and different languages. This study evaluates GPT-4V's ability to interpret meteorological charts and communicate weather hazards appropriately to the user, despite challenges of hallucinations, where generative AI delivers coherent, confident, but incorrect responses. We assess GPT-4V's competence via its web interface ChatGPT in two tasks: (1) generating a severe-weather outlook from weather-chart analysis and conducting self-evaluation, revealing an outlook that corresponds well with a Storm Prediction Center human-issued forecast; and (2) producing hazard summaries in Spanish and English from weather charts. Responses in Spanish, however, resemble direct (not idiomatic) translations from English to Spanish, yielding poorly translated summaries that lose critical idiomatic precision required for optimal communication. Our findings advocate for cautious integration of tools like GPT-4V in meteorology, underscoring the necessity of human oversight and development of trustworthy, explainable AI.</description>

      <title>Accurate deep learning-based filtering for chaotic dynamics by identifying instabilities without an ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ability to discover data assimilation (DA) schemes meant for chaotic dynamics with deep learning. The focus is on learning the analysis step of sequential DA, from state trajectories and their observations, using a simple residual convolutional neural network, while assuming the dynamics to be known. Experiments are performed with the Lorenz 96 dynamics, which display spatiotemporal chaos and for which solid benchmarks for DA performance exist. The accuracy of the states obtained from the learned analysis approaches that of the best possibly tuned ensemble Kalman filter, and is far better than that of variational DA alternatives. Critically, this can be achieved while propagating even just a single state in the forecast step. We investigate the reason for achieving ensemble filtering accuracy without an ensemble. We diagnose that the analysis scheme actually identifies key dynamical perturbations, mildly aligned with the unstable subspace, from the forecast state alone, without any ensemble-based covariances representation. This reveals that the analysis scheme has learned some multiplicative ergodic theorem associated to the DA process seen as a non-autonomous random dynamical system.</description>
