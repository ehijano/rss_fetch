      <title>Mechanics of elliptical JKR-type adhesive contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic Johnson Kendall Roberts (JKR) theory describes the short-ranged adhesive contact of elastic bodies, but is only valid for axisymmetric contact. A theory for non-axisymmetric contact, which relies on approximating the contact region as an ellipse, was proposed by Johnson and Greenwood (JG). The theory includes the effects of adhesion via Griffith's criterion applied only at the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the contact ellipse. Although JG's work is in good agreement with numerical and experimental results for quasi-circular contacts, the agreement worsens as the eccentricity of the contact region increases. In this paper, we show that including the effects of adhesion by instead minimizing the sum of elastic and surface energy yields results that are in excellent agreement with previous numerical simulations over the full range of contact eccentricities.</description>

      <title>Feeders and Expellers, Two Types of Animalcules With Outboard Cilia, Have Distinct Surface Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within biological fluid dynamics, it is conventional to distinguish between "puller" and "pusher" microswimmers on the basis of the forward or aft location of the flagella relative to the cell body: typically, bacteria are pushers and algae are pullers. Here we note that since many pullers have "outboard" cilia or flagella displaced laterally from the cell centerline on both sides of the organism, there are two important subclasses whose far-field is that of a stresslet, but whose near field is qualitatively more complex. The ciliary beat creates not only a propulsive force but also swirling flows that can be represented by paired rotlets with two possible senses of rotation, either "feeders" that sweep fluid toward the cell apex, or "expellers" that push fluid away. Experimental studies of the rotifer $Brachionus~plicatilis$ in combination with earlier work on the green algae $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$ show that the two classes have markedly different interactions with surfaces. When swimming near a surface, expellers such as $C.~reinhardtii$ scatter from the wall, whereas a feeder like $B.~plicatilis$ stably attaches. This results in a stochastic "run-and-stick" locomotion, with periods of ballistic motion parallel to the surface interrupted by trapping at the surface.</description>

      <title>Condensation and Synchronization in Aligning Chiral Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that spontaneous density segregation in dense systems of aligning circle swimmers is a condensation phenomenon at odds with the phase separation scenarios usually observed in two-dimensional active matter. The condensates, which take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite fraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing size as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies synchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local interactions. We propose a phenomenological theory based on observed mechanisms that accounts qualitatively for our results.</description>

      <title>Active Healing of Microtubule-Motor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cytoskeletal networks have a self-healing property where networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, both the mechanisms and dynamics of healing remain largely unknown. Here we report an unexplored healing mechanism in microtubule-motor networks by active crosslinking. We directly generate network cracks using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system, and observe that the cracks can self-heal. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to heal cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack heals below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of a boundary layer where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby heal the crack. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is found to be tunable by two dimensionless geometric parameters, the ratio of the boundary layer and network width, and the aspect ratio of the network. Our results provide a new framework for understanding healing in cytoskeletal networks and designing self-healable biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Enantiospecificity in NMR Enabled by Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin polarization in chiral molecules is a magnetic molecular response associated with electron transport and enantioselective bond polarization that occurs even in the absence of an external magnetic field. An unexpected finding by Santos and co-workers reported enantiospecific NMR responses in solid-state cross-polarization (CP) experiments, suggesting a possible additional contribution to the indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling in chiral molecules induced by bond polarization in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Herein we provide a theoretical treatment for this phenomenon, presenting an effective spin-Hamiltonian for helical molecules like DNA and density functional theory (DFT) results on amino acids that confirm the dependence of J-couplings on the choice of enantiomer. The connection between nuclear spin dynamics and chirality could offer insights for molecular sensing and quantum information sciences. These results establish NMR as a potential tool for chiral discrimination without external agents.</description>

      <title>Impact of Co-Excipient Selection on Hydrophobic Polymer Folding: Insights for Optimal Formulation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stabilization of liquid biological products is a complex task that depends on the chemical composition of both the active ingredient and any excipients in solution. Frequently, a large number of unique excipients are required to stabilize biologics, though it is not well-known how these excipients interact with one another. To probe these excipient-excipient interactions, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of arginine -- a widely used excipient with unique properties -- in solution either alone or with equimolar lysine or glutamate. We studied the effects of these mixtures on a hydrophobic polymer model to isolate excipient mechanisms on hydrophobic interactions, relevant to both protein folding and biomolecular self-assembly. We observed that arginine is the most effective single excipient in stabilizing hydrophobic polymer collapse, and its effectiveness can be augmented by lysine or glutamate addition. We utilized a decomposition of the potential of mean force to identify that the key source of arginine-lysine and arginine-glutamate synergy on polymer collapse is a reduction in attractive polymer-excipient direct interactions. Further, we applied principles from network theory to characterize the local solvent network that embeds the hydrophobic polymer. Through this approach, we found that arginine enables a more highly connected and stable network than in pure water, lysine, or glutamate solutions. Importantly, these network properties are preserved when lysine or glutamate are added to arginine solutions. Overall, we highlight the importance of identifying key molecular consequences of co-excipient selection, aiding in the establishment of rational formulation design rules.</description>

      <title>Effects of polydispersity and concentration on elastocapillary thinning of dilute polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thinning of liquid bridges under capillary stress occurs in widespread processes like jetting, dripping, and spraying, and creates a strong extensional flow capable of stretching dissolved polymers. If the elastic stress exceeds the viscous stress, an exponential `elastocapillary' (EC) thinning regime arises, yielding a timescale $\tau_{EC}$ commonly considered to be the longest relaxation time of the polymer $\lambda$. A longstanding question is why $\tau_{EC}$ depends on the polymer concentration, even at high dilutions where $\lambda$ should be constant in theory. To date this is understood in terms of intermolecular interactions that arise as polymers stretch. However, we show how the concentration dependence of $\tau_{EC}$ can be explained by considering the molecular weight distribution (MWD) inherent in real polymer samples. We demonstrate this by blending low-$M$ and high-$M$ polymer samples with narrow MWDs at dilute concentrations and in different proportions, and by measuring $\tau_{EC}$ for each blend in capillary thinning experiments. A simple model qualitatively reproduces the experimental results, showing how elastic stresses generated by the polymer build up prior to the EC regime due to sequential stretching of decreasing molecular weight species in the MWD. Since the elastic stress generated by each species depends on its concentration, the fraction of the MWD that is required to stretch in order to induce the EC regime depends on the total polymer concentration $c$. For higher $c$ the EC regime is induced by stretching of a higher-$M$ (longer $\lambda$) fraction of the MWD, and results in a longer measurement of $\tau_{EC}$. Our results have significant implications for the application of capillary thinning measurements to extensional rheometry, for the interpretation of such measurements, and for the understanding of elastocapillary thinning dynamics in general.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium relaxation of soft responsive colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimuli-responsive macromolecules display large conformational changes during their dynamics, sometimes switching states, and are an integral property for the development of soft functional materials. Here, we introduce a mean-field dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) for a model of responsive colloids (RCs) to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a colloidal dispersion in time-dependent external fields, with a focus on the coupling of translational and conformational dynamics during their relaxation. Specifically, we consider soft Gaussian particles with a bimodal size distribution between two confining walls with time-dependent (switching-on and off) external gravitational and osmotic fields. We find a rich relaxation behavior of the systems in excellent agreement with particle-based Brownian dynamics (BD) computer simulations. In particular, we find time-asymmetric relaxations of integrated observables (wall pressures, mean size, liquid center-of-mass) for activation/deactivation of external potentials, respectively, which are tuneable by the ratio of translational and conformational diffusion time scales. Our work paves thus the way for studying the nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics of complex soft matter with multiple degrees of freedom and hierarchical relaxations.</description>

      <title>Bulk and fracture process zone contribution to the rate-dependent adhesion amplification in viscoelastic broad-band materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contact between a rigid Hertzian indenter and an adhesive broad-band viscoelastic substrate is considered. The material behaviour is described by a modified power law model, which is characterized by only four parameters, the glassy and rubbery elastic moduli, a characteristic exponent n and a timescale ${\tau}_0$. The maximum adherence force that can be reached while unloading the rigid indenter from a relaxed viscoelastic half-space is studied by means of a numerical implementation based on the boundary element method, as a function of the unloading velocity, preload and by varying the broadness of the viscoelastic material spectrum. Through a comprehensive numerical analysis we have determined the minimum contact radius that is needed to achieve the maximum amplification of the pull-off force at a specified unloading rate and for different material exponents n. The numerical results are then compared with the prediction of Persson and Brener viscoelastic crack propagation theory, providing excellent agreement. However, comparison against experimental tests for a glass lens indenting a PDMS substrate show data can be fitted with the linear theory only up to an unloading rate of about $100 \textrm{ $\mu$}$m/s showing the fracture process zone rate-dependent contribution to the energy enhancement is of the same order of the bulk dissipation contribution. Hence, the limitations of the current numerical and theoretical models for viscoelastic adhesion are discussed in light of the most recent literature results.</description>

      <title>Tuning and predicting the onset of desiccation cracks in air-dried aqueous clay suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis- Stacks of clay platelets in aqueous suspension swell and break up gradually, with the exfoliated clay particles eventually self-assembling to form transient, fragile, gel-like networks. As a consequence of this physical aging phenomenon, clay suspensions transform spontaneously from viscoelastic liquids to viscoelastic solid-like phases. When subjected to desiccation, these colloidal systems accumulate drying-induced stresses and are prone to cracking. For a fixed evaporation rate and sample-boundary adhesion, it should be possible to control the formation of cracks by tuning the sample aging dynamics.
  Experiments- Clay suspensions layers were dried in controlled environments. The location and time of crack onset were recorded in imaging experiments. The elasticity of each partially dried sample was extracted by performing microindentation experiments in an atomic force microscope.
  Findings- Clay aging dynamics and desiccation crack onset were controlled by tuning clay and salt concentrations in the aqueous medium. Our experiments reveal that the crack onset time, $t_c$, varies with sample elasticity, $E$, according to $t_c \propto 1/\sqrt E$. We explain this correlation by proposing a simple scaling argument that incorporates the Griffith's fracture criterion in a poroelastic model. Fits to our model reveal the high ductility of aging clay suspensions. Besides allowing us to control the cracking process by tuning sample elasticity, our results are potentially useful in formulating crack-resistant coatings and paints.</description>

Abstract: In Clearing Up Mysteries -- The Original Goal (Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods: Cambridge, England, 1988 Springer, pp. 1-27) Jaynes derived Fick's Law for a dilute binary solution from Bayes' Theorem by considering, probabilistically, the motion of dilute solute molecules. Modifying Jaynes' prior, changing the frame of reference, and allowing for multicomponent systems, one can follow Jaynes' logic to arrive at several expressions for the diffusion coefficient that are widely used in application to solvent-polymer systems. These results, however, do not generally satisfy required conditions over the full concentration range. This limitation is resolved by considering the joint motion of all components in the solution with the inclusion of known physical constraints. Doing so, one arrives at a new set of constitutive equations for binary and multicomponent diffusion that include Darken's form as a limit and provide means to characterize inter-species correlations, removing the need for the ad hoc modifications of the thermodynamic term or substitution of bulk compositions with local compositions that have been proposed in the literature. In binary systems, the Bayesian expression for the mutual diffusion coefficient provides explicit limits on non-ideal mutual diffusion behavior, given component self-diffusion coefficients, that can be attributed to inter-species correlation versus stronger intra- and inter-species clustering. Applications of the model to published data for a set of binary systems are presented, along with pointers to further directions for research.</description>

      <title>Evanescent Optothermoelectric Trapping: Deeper Potentials at a Largescale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmons (SP) and their mediated effects have been widely used to manipulate micro- and nanoscale objects of dielectric and metallic nature. In this work, we show how SP excitation can be used to induce thermofluidic and thermoelectric effects to manipulate colloidal dynamics on a large scale. In an evanescent plasmonic trap, temperature gradients induce fluid flow that can facilitate particle accumulation. However, large out-of-plane flows expel particles from the trap, resulting in a shallow trap potential. Here, we numerically demonstrate how adding thermoelectric fields can overpower the optical and hydrodynamic forces to achieve a stable nanoparticle assembly at low excitation powers. We calculate the corresponding optical, fluidic, and thermoelectric trapping forces and potentials. These potentials can be enabled without resonant SP excitation, which requires careful optical alignment. Thus, we explain the mechanism of how, despite weak optical intensities and forces, sufficient trapping force can be supplied via the evanescent optothermoelectric trap to obtain large-scale reversible nanoparticle assemblies, irrespective of their shape, size, or material.</description>

      <title>Influence of fluid rheology on multistability in the unstable flow of polymer solutions through pore constriction arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse chemical, energy, environmental, and industrial processes involve the flow of polymer solutions in porous media. The accumulation and dissipation of elastic stresses as the polymers are transported through the tortuous, confined pore space can lead to the development of an elastic flow instability above a threshold flow rate. This flow instability can generate complex flows with strong spatiotemporal fluctuations, despite the low Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$); for example, in 1D ordered arrays of pore constrictions, this unstable flow can be multistable, with distinct pores exhibiting distinct unstable flow states. Here, we examine how this multistability is influenced by fluid rheology. Through experiments using diverse polymer solutions having systematic variations in fluid shear-thinning or elasticity, in pore constriction arrays of varying geometries, we show that the onset of multistability can be described using a single dimensionless parameter. This parameter, the streamwise Deborah number, compares the stress relaxation time of the polymer solution to the time required for the fluid to be advected between pore constrictions. Our work thus helps to deepen understanding of the influence of fluid rheology on elastic instabilities, helping to establish guidelines for the rational design of polymeric fluids with desirable flow behaviors.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian limited valence model for liquid polyamorphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase transitions have been found experimentally or by computer simulations in many compounds such as water, hydrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, carbon, silica, and silicon. Limited valence model implemented via event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm provides a simple generic mechanism for the liquid-liquid phase transitions in all these diverse cases. Here, we introduce a variant of the limited valence model with a well defined Hamiltonian, i.e., a unique algorithm by which the potential energy of the system of particles can be computed solely from the coordinates of the particles and is thus equivalent to a complex multi-body potential. We present several examples of the model which can be used to reproduce liquid-liquid phase transition in systems with maximum valence $z=1$ (hydrogen), $z=2$ (sulfur) and $z=4$ (water), where $z$ is the maximum number of bonds an atom is allowed to have. For $z=1$, we find a set of parameters for which the system has a liquid-liquid and an isostructural solid--solid critical points. For $z=4$, we find a set of parameters for which the phase diagram resembles that of water with a wide region of negative thermal expansion coefficient (density anomaly) extending into the metastable region of negative pressures. The limited valence model can be modified to forbid not only too large valences but also too low valences. In the case of sulfur, we forbid the formation of monomers, thus restricting the valence $v$ of an atom to be within an interval $1=v_{\rm min}\leqslant v\leqslant v_{\rm max}\equiv z=2$.</description>

      <title>The explicit bonding Reaction ensemble Monte Carlo method</title>

Abstract: We present the explicit bonding Reaction ensemble Monte Carlo (eb-RxMC) method, designed to sample reversible bonding reactions in macromolecular systems. Our eb-RxMC method is based on the Reaction ensemble method, however, its implementation differs from the latter by representation of the reaction. In the eb-RxMC implementation, we are adding or deleting bonds between existing particles, instead of inserting or deleting particles with different chemical identities. This new implementation makes the eb-RxMC method suitable for simulating the formation of reversible linkages between macromolecules, which would not be feasible with the original implementation. To enable coupling of our eb-RxMC algorithm with Molecular Dynamics algorithm for sampling of the configuration space, we biased the sampling of reactions only within a certain inclusion radius. We validated our algorithm using a set of ideally behaving systems undergoing dimerization and polycondensation reactions, for which analytical results are available. For dimerization reactions with various equilibrium constants and initial compositions, the degree of conversion measured in our simulations perfectly matched the reference values given by the analytical equations. We also showed that this agreement is not affected by the arbitrary choice of the inclusion radius or the stiffness of the harmonic bond potential. Next, we showed that our simulations can correctly match the analytical results for the distribution of the degree of polymerization and end-to-end distance of ideal chains in polycondensation reactions. Altogether, we demonstrated that our eb-RxMC simulations correctly sample both reaction and configuration space of these reference systems, opening the door to future simulations of more complex interacting macromolecular systems.</description>

      <title>The linear viscoelastic fracture theory applies to soft solids better when they are... viscoelastic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last half-century, linear viscoelastic models for crack growth in soft solids have flourished but their predictions have rarely been compared to experiments. In fact, most available models are either very approximate or cast in forms which are not quite suitable for the analysis of actual data. Here, we propose a linear viscoelastic approach which consistently exploits the dynamic mechanical analysis data. We apply this method to four sets of results documenting fracture or adhesion rupture in soft solids with various degrees of viscoelasticity. For elastomers, the results reproduce the well-known inconsistency of the process zone size. In more viscoelastic systems, however, the present approach is able to match the measured velocity dependence of the rupture energy with physically acceptable process zone sizes. Moreover, our predictions agree with the damage zone sizes measured by mechanoluminescence. Building on these results, we discuss various issues arising when evaluating the linear viscoelastic contribution to the rupture/adhesion energy in soft solids: data quality, physical interpretation of the parameters, validity of simpler approximations and limitations of the present approach.</description>

      <title>Simple model for the kinetics of stimuli-responsive gels with porous structures</title>

Abstract: Stimuli-responsive gels are the gels that vary the volume depending on environmental conditions. It has been reported that the stimuli-responsive gel with an inhomogeneous structure exhibits faster volume change than the gel without it. It is understood as a difference in the transfer dynamics of the solvent, though, there are few models for discussing the effect of inhomogeneity explicitly. In this paper, we propose a simple model for the kinetics of volume change by introducing inhomogeneity as the probability distribution for a random variable that characterizes the structure. Under this framework, we demonstrate that inhomogeneity actually increases the rate of volume change. Furthermore, through analysis of a simplified example, we show that some features that are often seen in experiments can be reproduced by the model. This model provides a simple equation for the time series of volume change that can be used to characterize the experimental data based on a simple physical picture of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids for which no theory or fundamental understanding is available. We derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier representing a crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula correctly recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are supported by comparisons with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids, which confirm that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations of water-ethanol mixtures. I. Composition trends in thermodynamic properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explored the composition dependence of a rather comprehensive set of properties of liquid water-ethanol mixtures by using the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics computer simulations. The united atom non-polarizable model from the TraPPE data basis for the ethanol molecule combined with the TIP4P-2005 and SPC/E water models is considered. We restrict our calculations to atmospheric pressure, 0.1013 MPa, and room temperature, 298.15 K. Composition trends of the behavior of density, excess mixing volume, apparent molar volumes are described. On the other hand, the excess mixing enthalpy and partial molar enthalpies of species are reported. Besides, we explore the coefficient of isobaric thermal expansion, isothermal heat capacity, adiabatic bulk modulus and heat capacity at constant pressure. In addition, the self-diffusion coefficients of species, the static dielectric constant and the surface tension are described. We intend to get insights into peculiarities of mixing of species in the mixture upon changes of ethanol molar fraction. The quality of predictions of the models is critically evaluated by detailed comparisons with experimental results. Then, necessary improvements of the modelling are discussed.</description>

      <title>Vapour-liquid phase behaviour of primitive models of ionic liquids confined in disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the description of ionic liquids (ILs) confined in a porous medium formed by a matrix of immobile randomly placed uncharged particles. The IL is modelled as an electroneutral mixture of hardsphere anions and flexible linear chain cations, represented by tangentially bonded hard spheres with the charge located on one of the terminal beads. The theory combines a generalization of the scaled particle theory, Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory, and the associative mean-spherical approximation and allows one to obtain analytical expressions for the pressure and chemical potentials of the matrix-IL system. Using the theory, we calculate the vapour-liquid phase diagrams for two versions of the IL model, i.e., when the cation is modelled as a dimer and as a chain, in a complete association limit. The effects of the matrix confinement and of the non-spherical shape of the cations on the vapour-liquid phase diagrams are studied.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly behaviour of diblock copolymer-diblock copolymer under oscillating shear field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-assembly behaviour of a diblock copolymer-diblock copolymer mixture under an oscillating shear field is investigated via cell dynamics simulation. The results indicate that the macrophase separation of the composite system is accompanied by the corresponding microphase separation induced by the oscillating shear field. With an increase in the shear frequency, the AB phase changes from a tilted layered structure to a parallel layered structure, and finally to a vertical layered structure. The CD phase transforms from the initial concentric ring into a parallel layer in the ring and then into a parallel layered structure; thus, the system finally forms a layered structure of the AB phase (vertical layer) and CD phase (parallel layer) perpendicular to each other. To verify the phase transition, the dynamic evolution of the domain size at different shear frequencies is analysed. The ordered phase transition with an increase in the oscillating shear field varies when the initial composition ratio of the system is changed. This conclusion provides a valuable guidance for the formation and transformation of ordered structures in experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a Brownian dynamics simulation of the bacterial Stirling engine studied by Krishnamurthy et al., Nat. Phys. 12, 1134 (2016). In their experimental setup, an overdamped colloid in an optical trap with time-modulated stiffness interacts with a bacterial bath that we represent by an ensemble of overdamped active particles. In the parameter regime of the experiment the thermodynamic performance is governed by an effective temperature and can be parametrized analytically by active Brownian particle models. We quantitatively reproduce the efficiencies reported for the experiments under the assumption that energy exchange with the bath during isochores of the cycle is entirely recuperated and in agreement with the second law.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Brownian particles under resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of an anisotropic particle subjected to different stochastic resetting schemes in two dimensions. The Brownian motion of shape-asymmetric particles in two dimensions results in anisotropic diffusion at short times, while the late-time transport is isotropic due to rotational diffusion. We show that the presence of orientational resetting promotes the anisotropy to late times. When the spatial and orientational degrees of freedom are reset, we find that a non-trivial spatial probability distribution emerges in the steady state that is determined by the initial orientation, particle asymmetry and the resetting rate. When only spatial degrees of freedom are reset while the orientational degree of freedom is allowed to evolve freely, the steady state is independent of the particle asymmetry. When only particle orientation is reset, the late-time probability density is given by a Gaussian with an effective diffusion tensor, including off-diagonal terms, determined by the resetting rate. Generally, the coupling between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom, when combined with stochastic resetting, gives rise to unique behaviour at late times not present in the case of symmetric particles. Considering recent developments in experimental implementations of resetting, our results can be useful for the control of asymmetric colloids, for example in self-assembly processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the hypothesized functions of biomolecular condensates is to act as chemical reactors, where chemical reactions can be modulated, i.e. accelerated or slowed down, while substrate molecules enter and products exit from the condensate. Likewise, the components themselves that take part in the architectural integrity of condensates might be modified by active (energy consuming, non-equilibrium) processes, e.g. by ATPase chaperones or by kinases and phosphatases. In this work, we study how the presence of spatial inhomogeneities, such as in the case of liquid-liquid phase separation, affects active chemical reactions and results in the presence of directional flows of matter, which are one of the hallmarks of non-equilibirum processes. We establish the minimal conditions for the existence of such spatial currents, and we furthermore find that these fluxes are maximal at the condensate interface. These results propose that some condensates might be most efficient as chemical factories due to their interfaces rather than their volumes, and could suggest a possible biological reason for the the observed abundance of small non-fusing condensates inside the cell, thus maximizing their surface and the associated fluxes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of underdamped Brownian collisional engines: New insights and resonant phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have been proposed as alternatives for nonequilibrium nanoscale engines. However, most studies have focused on the simpler overdamped case, leaving the role of inertia much less explored. In this work, we introduce the idea of collisional engines to underdamped Brownian particles, where each stage is sequentially subjected to a distinct driving force. A careful comparison between the performance of underdamped and overdamped Brownian work-to-work engines has been undertaken. The results show that underdamped Brownian engines generally outperform their overdamped counterparts. A key difference is the presence of a resonant regime in underdamped engines, in which both efficiency and power output are enhanced across a broad set of parameters. Our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting dynamics and driving protocols to achieve optimal engine performance.</description>
