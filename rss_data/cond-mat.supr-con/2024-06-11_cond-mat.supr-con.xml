      <title>Fermi-Liquid Theory for Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi liquid theory is used to generate the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functionals for unconventional superconductors belonging to various representations. The parameters defining the GL functional depend on Fermi surface anisotropy, impurity scattering and the symmetry class of the pairing interaction. As applications I consider the basic models for the superconducting phases of UPt$_3$. Two predictions of Fermi liquid theory for the two-dimensional representations of the hexagonal symmetry group are (i) the zero-field equilibrium state exhibits spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, and (ii) the gradient energies for the different 2D representations, although described by a similar GL functionals, are particularly sensitive to the orbital symmetry of the pairing state and Fermi surface anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in metallic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity, the amazing phenomenon of lossless transmission of electric current through metallic wires, requires cooling of the wire to low temperatures. Metallic hydrogen is considered as the most likely candidate for superconductivity at very high temperatures, possibly even room temperature. However, as a result of various approximations used, conflicting theoretical predictions exist for the range of temperatures where superconductivity is expected to occur. Here we avoid those approximations and confirm that metallic hydrogen is indeed a superconductor, but this is limited to temperatures far below previous estimates. We exploit the ``jellium'' model proposed in 1966 by De Gennes, where superconductivity is caused by the combination of Coulomb repulsion between the electrons and Coulomb attraction between the protons and the electrons. We find that the superconducting order develops over an energy range far exceeding the characteristic phonon energy, and that the phase of the order parameter flips 180 degrees at the characteristic phonon energy above and below the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Visualizing uniform lattice-scale pair density wave in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical BCS superconductors are microscopically homogeneous in real space governed by the coherent Cooper pairs with high phase stiffness of superfluid density, which is characterized by a coherence length. However, a periodic oscillation of superconducting order parameter may develop driven by breaking the time-reversal or translational invariance. To date, such modulated orders were specific to each material systems, with a periodicity much larger than the lattice constant. Here we report the direct observation of a uniform lattice-scale pair density wave (PDW) in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films, enforced by peculiar interfacial structure of crystal symmetries breaking. Our spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy unravels a spatial modulation of Cooper-pairing gap within a single unit-cell, depending on inequivalent atomic sites. Prominent periodic variation of superfluid density is visualized via Josephson current by a superconducting tip, indicating a real-space oscillation of phase stiffness. Such a lattice-scale superconducting modulation, which coexists with a larger length scale of PDW order, indicates the lattice-scale variation of both pairing strength and phase stiffness. Our findings provide new insights into the intertwined density-wave orders of quasiparticle character in correlated electronic systems, and provoke future studies on the unconventional paring interaction and phase stiffness in the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Majorana Zero Modes in Lieb-Kitaev Model with Tunable Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between band topology and Majorana zero energy modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors had been well studied in the past decades. However, the relation between the quantum metric and MZMs has yet to be understood. In this work, we first introduce a three band Lieb-like lattice model with an isolated flat band and tunable quantum metric. By introducing nearest neighbor equal spin pairing, we obtain the Lieb-Kitaev model which supports MZMs. When the Fermi energy is set within the flat band, the MZMs are supposed to be well-localized at the ends of the 1D superconductor due to the flatness of the band. On the contrary, we show both numerically and analytically that the localization length of the MZMs is controlled by a length scale defined by the quantum metric of the flat band, which we call the quantum metric length (QML). The QML can be several orders of magnitude longer than the conventional BCS superconducting coherence length. When the QML is comparable to the length of the superconductor, the two MZMs from the two ends of the superconductor can hybridize. When two metallic leads are coupled to the two MZMs, crossed Andreev reflection probability can nearly reach the maximal theoretical value. This work unveils how the quantum metric can greatly influence the properties of MZMs through the QML and the results can be generalized to other topological bound states.</description>

      <title>Effects of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of type-II holographic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work concerns the detailed construction of a holographic model for a type-II s-wave superconductor defined on a 5-dimensional anisotropic rotating black hole. We examine the role of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of the superconductor model focusing on the condensate and the AC conductivity, for which we obtain closed formulas, using both analytical and numerical methods. The results reveal that the rotation is responsible for the appearance of a peak and for introducing an exponentially vanishing behavior in the high-frequency limit of the real component of the AC conductivity. Such a behavior aligns with that observed in high-temperature superconductor models and experiments, where the peak and vanishing behavior result from quasiparticle damping, suggesting a plausible relation between the rotation of a black hole and quasiparticle damping effects in a superconducting material. In addition, we provide a detailed construction of the vortex lattice presented in arXiv:2208.05988 and study its behavior as a function of an external uniform magnetic field. Once again, it is shown that the vortex lattice can be continuously deformed along with a change in the vortex population by virtue of the magnetic field, providing a promising avenue for holographically modeling the vortex lattice deformations observed in experimental superconducting materials. As an observed experimental effect, we describe both the vortex lattice deformation and the vortex population increment under the action of an external magnetic field in the LiFeAs type-II superconductor. These effects supplement those previously found for the FeSe type-II superconductor studied in arXiv:2208.05988.</description>

      <title>Beyond the standard model of topological Josephson junctions: From crystalline anisotropy to finite-size and diode effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planar Josephson junction is a versatile platform to realize topological superconductivity over a large parameter space and host Majorana bound states. With a change in Zeeman field, this system undergoes a transition from trivial to topological superconductivity accompanied by a jump in the superconducting phase difference between the two superconductors. A standard model of these Josephson junctions, which can be fabricated to have a nearly perfect interfacial transparency, predicts a simple universal behavior. In that model, at the same value of Zeeman field for the topological transition, there is a $\pi$ phase jump and a minimum in the critical superconducting current, while applying a controllable phase difference yields a diamond-shaped topological region as a function of that phase difference and a Zeeman field. In contrast, even for a perfect interfacial transparency, we find a much richer and nonuniversal behavior as the width of the superconductor is varied or the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling is considered. The Zeeman field for the phase jump, not necessarily $\pi$, is different from the value for the minimum critical current, while there is a strong deviation from the diamond-like topological region. These Josephson junctions show a striking example of a nonreciprocal transport and superconducting diode effect, revealing the importance of our findings not only for topological superconductivity and fault-tolerant quantum computing, but also for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Resilient Growth of Highly Crystalline Topological Insulator-Superconductor Heterostructure Enabled by Ex-situ Nitride Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly crystalline and easily feasible topological insulator-superconductor (TI-SC) heterostructures are crucial for the development of practical topological qubit devices. The optimal superconducting layer for TI-SC heterostructures should be highly resilient against external contaminations and structurally compatible with TIs. In this study, we provide a solution to this challenge by showcasing the growth of a highly crystalline TI-SC heterostructure using refractory TiN (111) as the superconducting layer. This approach can eliminate the need for in-situ cleaving or growth. More importantly, the TiN surface shows high resilience against contaminations during air exposure, as demonstrated by the successful recyclable growth of Bi2Se3. Our findings indicate that TI-SC heterostructures based on nitride films are compatible with device fabrication techniques, paving a path to the realization of practical topological qubit devices in the future.</description>

      <title>Spatial dependence of local density of states in semiconductor-superconductor hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana bound states are expected to appear in one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor hybrid systems, provided they are homogenous enough to host a global topological phase. In order to experimentally investigate the uniformity of the system, we study the spatial dependence of the local density of states in multiprobe devices where several local tunnelling probes are positioned along a gate-defined wire in a two-dimensional electron gas. Spectroscopy at each probe reveals a hard induced gap, and an absence of subgap states at zero magnetic field. However, subgap states emerging at finite magnetic field are not always correlated between different probes. Moreover, we find that the extracted critical field and effective $g$-factor of the lowest energy subgap state varies significantly across the length of the wire. Upon studying several such devices we do however find examples of striking correlations in the local density of states measured at different tunnel probes. We discuss possible sources of variations across devices.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a computational analysis of a superconducting transmon qubit design, in which the superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Josephson junction is replaced by a co-planar, superconductor-constriction-superconductor (ScS) nanobridge junction. Within the scope of Ginzburg-Landau theory, we find that the nanobridge ScS transmon has an improved charge dispersion compared to the SIS transmon, with a tradeoff of smaller anharmonicity. These calculations provide a framework for estimating the superconductor material properties and junction dimensions compatible with gigahertz frequency ScS transmon operation.</description>

      <title>New pairing mechanism via chiral electron-hole condensation for non-BCS superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel chiral electron-hole (CEH) pairing mechanism is proposed to account for non-BCS superconductivity. In contrast to BCS Cooper pairs, CEH pairs exhibit a pronounced affinity to antiferromagnetism for superconductivity. The gap equations derived from this new microscopic mechanism are analyzed for both s- and d-wave superconductivity, revealing marked departures from the BCS theory. Unsurprisingly, CEH naturally describes superconductivity in strongly-correlated systems, necessitating an exceedingly large coupling parameter ($\lambda&gt;1$ for s-wave and $\lambda&gt;\pi/2$ for d-wave) to be efficacious. The new mechanism provides a better understanding of various non-BCS features, especially in cuprate and iron-based superconductors. In particular, CEH, through quantitative comparison with experimental data, shows promise in solving long-standing puzzles such as the unexpectedly large gap-to-critical-temperature ratio $\Delta_0/T_c$, the lack of gap closure at $T_c$, superconducting phase diagrams, and a non-zero heat-capacity-to-temperature ratio $C/T$ at $T=0$ (i.e., the ``anomalous linear term''), along with its quadratic behavior near $T=0$ for d-wave cuprates.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary time - an exact scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. The formulation we use makes it clear that Schmid's superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ is forbidden already at the qualitative level. This confirms theoretically a similar conclusion based on experimental observations drawn in 2020 by Murani et al. For all parameters investigated, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted from ill-assuming it would not.</description>

Abstract: Majorana fermions, exotic particles with potential applications in quantum computing, have garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics. The Kitaev model serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the emergence of Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. We explore the intriguing question of whether Majorana fermions can arise in a normal metal (NM) side-coupled to a Kitaev chain (KC) in the topologically trivial phase. Our findings reveal affirmative evidence, further demonstrating that the KC, when in the topological phase, can induce additional Majorana fermions in the neighboring NM region. Through extensive parameter analysis, we uncover the potential for zero, one, or two pairs of Majorana fermions in a KC side-coupled to an NM. Additionally, we investigate the impact of magnetic flux on the system and calculate the winding number -a topological invariant used to characterize topological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding superfluidity remains a major goal of condensed matter physics. Here we tackle this challenge utilizing the recently developed Fermionic neural network (FermiNet) wave function Ansatz [D. Pfau et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 033429 (2020).] for variational Monte Carlo calculations. We study the unitary Fermi gas, a system with strong, short-range, two-body interactions known to possess a superfluid ground state but difficult to describe quantitatively. We demonstrate key limitations of the FermiNet Ansatz in studying the unitary Fermi gas and propose a simple modification based on the idea of an antisymmetric geminal power singlet (AGPs) wave function. The new AGPs FermiNet outperforms the original FermiNet significantly in paired systems, giving results which are more accurate than fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo and are consistent with experiment. We prove mathematically that the new Ansatz, which only differs from the original Ansatz by the method of antisymmetrization, is a strict generalization of the original FermiNet architecture, despite the use of fewer parameters. Our approach shares several advantages with the original FermiNet: the use of a neural network removes the need for an underlying basis set; and the flexibility of the network yields extremely accurate results within a variational quantum Monte Carlo framework that provides access to unbiased estimates of arbitrary ground-state expectation values. We discuss how the method can be extended to study other superfluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in quantum computing is speeding up measurement and initialization. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a dispersive measurement method for superconducting qubits that simultaneously measures the qubit and returns the readout resonator to its initial state. The approach is based on universal analytical pulses and requires knowledge of the qubit and resonator parameters, but needs no direct optimization of the pulse shape, even when accounting for the nonlinearity of the system. Moreover, the method generalizes to measuring an arbitrary number of modes and states. For the qubit readout, we can drive the resonator to $\sim 10^2$ photons and back to $\sim 10^{-3}$ photons in less than $3 \kappa^{-1}$, while still achieving a $T_1$-limited assignment error below 1\%. We also present universal pulse shapes and experimental results for qutrit readout.</description>
