      <title>Data-driven assessment for the predictability of On-Demand Responsive Transit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By adapting bus routes to users' requests, Demand-Responsive Transit (DRT) can serve low-demand areas more efficiently than conventional fixed-line buses. However, a main barrier to its adoption of DRT is its unpredictability, i.e., it is not possible to know a-priori how much time a certain trip will take, especially when no large prebooking is imposed. To remove this barrier, we propose a data-driven method that, based on few previously observed trips, quantifies the level of predictability of a DRT service. We simulate different scenarios in VISUM in two Italian cities. We find that, above reasonable levels of flexibility, DRT is more predictable than one would expect, as it is possible to build a model that is able to provide a time indication with more than 90% reliability. We show how our method can support the operators in dimensioning of the service to ensure sufficient predictability.</description>

      <title>Identifying Core-Periphery Structures in Networks via Artificial Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core periphery structure represents a meso-scale structure in networks, characterized by a dense interconnection of core nodes and sparse connections among peripheral nodes. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach for detecting core periphery structure, leveraging Artificial Ants. Core-periphery structures play a crucial role in elucidating network organization across various domains. The proposed approach, inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, employs artificial pheromone trails to iteratively construct and refine solutions, thereby eliminating the need for arbitrary partitions that often constrain traditional methods. Our method is applied to a diverse selection of real world networks including historical, literary, linguistic, sports, and animal social networks highlighting its adaptability and robustness. We systematically compare the performance of our approach against established core-periphery detection techniques, emphasizing differences in node classification between the core and periphery. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior flexibility and precision, offering marked improvements in the accuracy of core periphery structure detection.</description>

      <title>Funnel theorems for spreading on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive novel analytic tools for the Bass and SI models on networks for the spreading of innovations and epidemics on networks. We prove that the correlation between the nonadoption (noninfection) probabilities of $L \ge 2$ disjoint subsets of nodes $\{A_l\}_{l=1}^L$ is non-negative, find the necessary and sufficient condition that determines whether this correlation is positive or zero, and provide an upper bound for its magnitude. Using this result, we prove the funnel theorems, which provide lower and upper bounds for the difference between the non-adoption probability of a node and the product of its nonadoption probabilities on $L$ modified networks in which the node under consideration is only influenced by incoming edges from $A_l$ for $l=1, \dots, L$. The funnel theorems can be used, among other things, to explicitly compute the exact expected adoption/infection level on various types of networks, both with and without cycles.</description>

      <title>Cities beyond proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of `proximity-based cities' has gained attention as a new urban organizational model. Most prominently, the 15-minute city contends that cities can function more effectively, equitably and sustainably if essential, everyday services and key amenities are within a 15-minute walk or cycle. However, focusing solely on travel time risks overlooking disparities in service quality, as the proximity paradigm tends to emphasize the mere presence of an element in a location rather than bringing up more complex questions of identity, diversity, quality, value or relationships. Transitioning to value-based cities by considering more than just proximity can enhance local identity, resilience and urban democracy. Fostering bottom-up initiatives can create a culture of local care and value, while predominantly top-down governing strategies can lead to large inequalities. Balancing these approaches can maximize resilience, health and sustainability. This equilibrium has the potential to accompany sustainable growth, by encouraging the creation of innovative urban solutions and reducing inequalities.</description>

      <title>Environmental variability promotes the evolution of cooperation among geographically dispersed groups on dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolutionary process that led to the emergence of modern human behaviors during the Middle Stone Age in Africa remains enigmatic. While various hypotheses have been proposed, we offer a new perspective that integrates the variability selection hypothesis (VSH) with the evolution of cooperation among human groups. The VSH suggests that human adaptability to fluctuating environments was a primary force driving the development of key evolutionary traits. However, the mechanisms by which environmental variability (EV) influenced human evolution, particularly the emergence of large-scale and complex cooperative behaviors, are not yet fully understood. To explore the connection between intensified EV and the evolution of intergroup cooperation, we analyzed three stochastic models of EV: (i) Regional Variability (RV), where resource-rich areas shift while overall resource levels remain stable; (ii) Universal Variability (UV), where overall resource levels fluctuate but resource-rich areas remain stable; and (iii) Combined Variability (CV), where both resource-rich areas shift and overall resource levels fluctuate. Our results show that RV strongly promotes cooperation, while UV has a comparatively weaker effect. Additionally, our findings indicate that the coevolution of cooperation and network structures is crucial for EVs to effectively promote cooperation. This study proposes a novel causal link between EV and the evolution of cooperation, potentially setting a new direction for both theoretical and empirical research in this field.</description>

      <title>Explicit solutions of the SI and Bass models on sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and regular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit expressions for the expected adoption and infection level in the Bass and SI models, respectively, on sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks and on $d$-regular networks. These expressions are soloutions of first-order ordinary differential equations, which are fairly easy to analyze. To prove that these expressions are exact, we show that the effect of cycles vanishes as the network size goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of relationship-driven cooperation under recommendation protocol on multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While traditional game models often simplify interactions among agents as static, real-world social relationships are inherently dynamic, influenced by both immediate payoffs and alternative information. Motivated by this fact, we introduce a coevolutionary multiplex network model that incorporates the concepts of a relationship threshold and a recommendation mechanism to explore how the strength of relationships among agents interacts with their strategy choices within the framework of weak prisoner's dilemma games. In the relationship layer, the relationship strength between agents varies based on interaction outcomes. In return, the strategy choice of agents in the game layer is influenced by both payoffs and relationship indices, and agents can interact with distant agents through a recommendation mechanism. Simulation of various network topologies reveals that a higher average degree supports cooperation, although increased randomness in interactions may inhibit its formation. Interestingly, a higher threshold value of interaction quality is detrimental, while the applied recommendation protocol can improve global cooperation. The best results are obtained when the relative weight of payoff is minimal and the individual fitness is dominated by the relationship indices gained from the quality of links to neighbors. As a consequence, the changes in the distribution of relationship indices are closely correlated with overall levels of cooperation.</description>

      <title>During and after COVID-19: What happened to the home advantage in Germany's first football division?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-established that the home advantage (HA), the phenomenon that on average the local team performs better than the visiting team, exists in many sports. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, spectators were banned from football stadiums, which we leverage as a natural experiment to examine the impact of stadium spectators on HA. Using data from the first division of the German Bundesliga for seasons 2016/17 to 2023/24, we are the first to focus on a longer time horizon and consider not only the first but all three seasons subject to spectator regulations as well as two subsequent seasons without. We confirm previous studies regarding the disappearance of the HA in the last nine matches of season 2019/20. This drop materialised almost entirely through a reduction of home goals. The HA in season 2020/21 (with spectator ban during most matches) was very close to the pre-COVID-19 season 2018/19, indicating that teams became accustomed to the absence of spectators. For season 2021/22, with varying spectator regulations, we detect a U-shaped relationship between HA and the stadium utilisation rate, where HA increases considerably for matches with medium stadium utilisation which is associated with a larger difference in running distance between the home and away teams.</description>

      <title>The impact of fear and behaviour response to established and novel diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a disease transmission model that allows individuals to acquire fear and change their behaviour to reduce transmission. Fear is acquired through contact with infected individuals and through the influence of fearful individuals. We analyze the model in two limits: First, an Established Disease Limit (EDL), where the spread of the disease is much faster than the spread of fear, and second, a Novel Disease Limit (NDL), where the spread of the disease is comparable to that of fear. For the EDL, we show that the relative rate of fear acquisition to disease transmission controls the size of the fearful population at the end of a disease outbreak, and that the fear-induced contact reduction behaviour has very little impact on disease burden. Conversely, we show that in the NDL, disease burden can be controlled by fear-induced behaviour depending on the rate of fear loss. Specifically, fear-induced behaviour introduces a contact parameter $p$, which if too large prevents the contact reduction from effectively managing the epidemic. We analytically identify a critical prophylactic behaviour parameter $p=p_c$ where this happens leading to a discontinuity in epidemic prevalence. We show that this change in disease burden introduces delayed epidemic waves.</description>

      <title>An embedding-based distance for temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.</description>

      <title>Studying power-grid synchronization with incremental refinement of model heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling power-grid systems has got a major importance in present days as transformation to renewable energy sources requires the complete re-design of energy transmission. Renewable energy sources can be located quite far from their consumption points because urban and industrial structures do not follow physical constraints and capabilities. Important examples are the sea coast vs inland divisions in the case of wind power. Ill-constructed high-voltage (HV) power grids can cause catastrophic damages to economies as it was demonstrated in recent history via the emergence of large blackout events. The probability distributions of such events was found to be fat-tailed, exhibiting power-law (PL) tails very often. To understand them, self-organized critical direct current (DC) models have been constructed~\cite{car2} and have been shown to describe well the PL exponents of empirical values. However, many details could not be understood as power-grids work with alternating currents (AC) in which phase differences are the primary causes of the power-flows.</description>
