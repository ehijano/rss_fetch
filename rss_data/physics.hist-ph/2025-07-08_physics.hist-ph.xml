      <title>The Creation of Particles in an Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document is the Ph.D. thesis of Leonard Parker, submitted to Harvard University in 1966. Over the decades, several generations of physicists have been introduced to the concept of particle creation by gravitational fields, a phenomenon that has become a cornerstone in exploring the interplay between gravitation and quantum theory. Yet, the foundational breakthrough that led to the prediction and understanding of this phenomenon remains unfamiliar to many. In the interest of historical accuracy and in recognition of a seminal contribution to physics, the thesis has been retyped and made it freely available as an open-access (arXiv) document. The reissued thesis is accompanied by a Foreword that places the work in its proper historical context.
  As the team responsible for this new edition, we (Antonio Ferreiro, Jos\'e Navarro-Salas, and Silvia Pla) hope that future generations will continue to draw inspiration from this pioneering text.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics I: phenomenology of quantum observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are obtained through sequential probing of quantum systems; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to derive, on this basis, a complete and fully functional formalism rooted in the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the resulting formalism--the bi-trajectory formalism--differs significantly from the standard state-focused formulation. In Part I of the paper, we analyze the outcomes of various experiments involving sequential measurements of quantum observables. These outcomes are quantitatively described by phenomenological multi-time probability distributions, estimated from experimental data. Our first conclusion is that the theory describing these experiments must be non-classical: the measured sequences cannot be interpreted as sampling of a uni-trajectory representing the system's observable. The non-classical nature of the investigated systems manifests in a range of observed phenomena, including quantum interference, the quantum Zeno effect, and uncertainty relations between the measured observables.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics II: deducing the formalism from experimental observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. In the concluding Part II of the paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the phenomenological inputs described in Part I. We show that the resulting formalism exhibits an affinity with Hilbert spaces, and we derive an explicit representation in terms of those mathematical structures. Analogues of the obtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are readily identifiable within the standard formalism. However, once these building blocks are assembled according to the blueprint of the deduced bi-trajectory formalism, it becomes evident that the new and the standard formalisms differ substantially at the conceptual level. These differences do not negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect to empirically testable predictions. Rather, the emergence of a novel, non-standard formulation should be seen as a relatively rare opportunity to reassess, from a fresh perspective, some of the long-standing foundational issues in the theory. The hope is that the new approach may prove more successful in addressing problems that have resisted resolution within the established theoretical framework.</description>
