      <title>Probability distributions and calculations for Hake's ratio statistics in measuring effect size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ratio statistics and distributions play a crucial role in various fields, including linear regression, metrology, nuclear physics, operations research, econometrics, biostatistics, genetics, and engineering. In this work, we examine the statistical properties and probability calculations of the Hake normalized gain as a measure of effect size and educational effectiveness in physics education. Leveraging existing knowledge about the Hake ratio as a ratio of normal variables and utilizing open data science tools, we developed two novel computational approaches for computing ratio distributions. Our pilot numerical study demonstrates the speed, accuracy, and reliability of calculating ratio distributions through (1) DE quadrature with/without barycentric interpolation, a very quick and efficient quadrature method, and (2) a 2D vectorized numerical inversion of characteristic functions, which offers broader applicability by not requiring knowledge of PDFs or the independence of ratio constituents. These numerical explorations not only deepen the understanding of the Hake ratio's distribution but also showcase the efficiency, precision, and versatility of our proposed methods, making them highly suitable for fast data analysis based on exact probability ratio distributions. This capability has potential applications in multidimensional statistics and uncertainty analysis in metrology, where precise and reliable data handling is essential.</description>

      <title>Supervised Autoencoders with Fractionally Differentiated Features and Triple Barrier Labelling Enhance Predictions on Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of financial time series forecasting with the use of neural networks through supervised autoencoders (SAE), to improve investment strategy performance. Using the Sharpe and Information Ratios, it specifically examines the impact of noise augmentation and triple barrier labeling on risk-adjusted returns. The study focuses on Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum as the traded assets from January 1, 2016, to April 30, 2022. Findings indicate that supervised autoencoders, with balanced noise augmentation and bottleneck size, significantly boost strategy effectiveness. However, excessive noise and large bottleneck sizes can impair performance.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis on Policy-Augmented Graphical Hybrid Models with Shapley Value Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the critical challenges in biomanufacturing, including high complexity and high uncertainty, we propose a comprehensive and computationally efficient sensitivity analysis framework for general nonlinear policy-augmented knowledge graphical (pKG) hybrid models that characterize the risk- and science-based understandings of underlying stochastic decision process mechanisms. The criticality of each input (i.e., random factors, policy parameters, and model parameters) is measured by applying Shapley value (SV) sensitivity analysis to pKG (called SV-pKG), accounting for process causal interdependences. To quickly assess the SV for heavily instrumented bioprocesses, we approximate their dynamics with linear Gaussian pKG models and improve the SV estimation efficiency by utilizing the linear Gaussian properties. In addition, we propose an effective permutation sampling method with TFWW transformation and variance reduction techniques, namely the quasi-Monte Carlo and antithetic sampling methods, to further improve the sampling efficiency and estimation accuracy of SV for both general nonlinear and linear Gaussian pKG models. Our proposed framework can benefit efficient interpretation and support stable optimal process control in biomanufacturing.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary MCMC and particle Gibbs samplers for parallelisable inference in latent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing efficient exact MCMC algorithms for sampling from the full posterior distribution of high-dimensional (in the number of time steps and the dimension of the latent space) non-linear non-Gaussian latent dynamical models. Particle Gibbs, also known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), constitutes the de facto golden standard to do so, but suffers from degeneracy problems when the dimension of the latent space increases. On the other hand, the routinely employed globally Gaussian-approximated (e.g., extended Kalman filtering) biased solutions are seldom used for this same purpose even though they are more robust than their SMC counterparts. In this article, we show how, by introducing auxiliary observation variables in the model, we can both implement efficient exact Kalman-based samplers for large state-space models, as well as dramatically improve the mixing speed of particle Gibbs algorithms when the dimension of the latent space increases. We demonstrate when and how we can parallelise these auxiliary samplers along the time dimension, resulting in algorithms that scale logarithmically with the number of time steps when implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs). Both algorithms are easily tuned and can be extended to accommodate sophisticated approximation techniques. We demonstrate the improved statistical and computational performance of our auxiliary samplers compared to state-of-the-art alternatives for high-dimensional (in both time and state space) latent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volatility in Mean: Efficient Analysis by a Generalized Mixture Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the simulation-based Bayesian analysis of stochastic volatility in mean (SVM) models. Extending the highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo mixture sampler for the SV model proposed in Kim et al. (1998) and Omori et al. (2007), we develop an accurate approximation of the non-central chi-squared distribution as a mixture of thirty normal distributions. Under this mixture representation, we sample the parameters and latent volatilities in one block. We also detail a correction of the small approximation error by using additional Metropolis-Hastings steps. The proposed method is extended to the SVM model with leverage. The methodology and models are applied to excess holding yields and S&amp;P500 returns in empirical studies, and the SVM models are shown to outperform other volatility models based on marginal likelihoods.</description>

      <title>Copula-Linked Parallel ICA: A Method for Coupling Structural and Functional MRI brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different brain imaging modalities offer unique insights into brain function and structure. Combining them enhances our understanding of neural mechanisms. Prior multimodal studies fusing functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) have shown the benefits of this approach. Since sMRI lacks temporal data, existing fusion methods often compress fMRI temporal information into summary measures, sacrificing rich temporal dynamics. Motivated by the observation that covarying networks are identified in both sMRI and resting-state fMRI, we developed a novel fusion method, by combining deep learning frameworks, copulas and independent component analysis (ICA), named copula linked parallel ICA (CLiP-ICA). This method estimates independent sources for each modality and links the spatial sources of fMRI and sMRI using a copula-based model for more flexible integration of temporal and spatial data. We tested CLiP-ICA using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results showed that CLiP-ICA effectively captures both strongly and weakly linked sMRI and fMRI networks, including the cerebellum, sensorimotor, visual, cognitive control, and default mode networks. It revealed more meaningful components and fewer artifacts, addressing the long-standing issue of optimal model order in ICA. CLiP-ICA also detected complex functional connectivity patterns across stages of cognitive decline, with cognitively normal subjects generally showing higher connectivity in sensorimotor and visual networks compared to patients with Alzheimer, along with patterns suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms.</description>
