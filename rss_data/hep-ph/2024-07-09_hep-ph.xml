      <title>Subleading operators and gamma5-scheme dependence in SMEFT for Higgs boson pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of contributions from the chromomagnetic and four-top-quark-operators within Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to Higgs boson pair production in gluon fusion is presented, in combination with NLO QCD corrections. Here we focus on the $\gamma_5$-scheme dependence introduced by the four-top-quark-operators and the interplay with other operators contributing to this process in SMEFT.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrinos From Millicharged Dark Matter Annihilation in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millicharged dark matter particles can be efficiently captured by the Sun, where they annihilate into tau leptons, leading to the production of high-energy neutrinos. In contrast to the Earth, the high temperature of the Sun suppresses the fraction of millicharged particles that are bound to nuclei, allowing for potentially high annihilation rates. We recast existing constraints from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and use this information to place new limits on the fraction of the dark matter that is millicharged. This analysis excludes previously unexplored parameter space for masses of $m_\chi \sim (5-100) \ \text{GeV}$, charges of $q_\chi \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$, and fractional abundances as small as $f_{_\text{DM}} \sim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>HyperLSW: Ultimate light-shining-through-a-wall experiments to establish QCD axions as the dominant form of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Should dark matter (DM) axions be discovered in a haloscope, follow-up experiments will be necessary to break the degeneracy between the axions' coupling to photons and their local DM abundance. Given that a discovery would justify more significant investments, the present work assesses the prospects of ambitious light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) experiments to target the QCD axion band. Thanks to the excellent mass determination in haloscopes, we show how to design HyperLSW, an LSW experiment with suitably aligned magnetic fields to reach a wide range of well-motivated axion models and to determine whether axions are the dominant form of DM in the Universe. In addition to presenting a concrete plan for post-discovery experimental efforts, we also briefly discuss complementary experiments and future directions beyond LSW experiments.</description>

      <title>Gluon to $q\bar q$ antenna in anisotropic QCD matter: spin-polarized and azimuthal jet observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of a quark-antiquark antenna in the presence of a dense and anisotropic QCD medium. We assume the antenna to originate from an unpolarized gluon state, and consider both massless and massive final states. The medium anisotropy is captured by allowing the jet quenching coefficient to take different magnitudes in orthogonal directions with respect to the jet axis. We find that the final particle distribution is sensitive to the medium anisotropy, and more importantly, that this effect couples directly to the helicity/spin of the final states. We propose to look into these effects by performing a Fourier decomposition of the particle distribution inside the jet. In our medium model, we find that the spin independent terms contribute to the even harmonics of the cosine series. The helicity/spin dependence enters only through the sine Fourier series. We further explore the spin dependence by examining the degree of polarization of the final states in different directions. Our results indicate that the anisotropies present in the QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions can be probed by studying azimuthal and spin observables inside jets.</description>

      <title>Phasing out of Darkness: From Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter to Neutrino Masses via Time-Dependent Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are a compelling candidate for generating neutrino masses and for elucidating the nature of dark matter. Astrophysical X-ray constraints on sterile neutrino dark matter decays, however, largely exclude the active-sterile mixing required to produce simultaneously the correct left-handed neutrino spectrum and keV-scale right-handed neutrino dark matter within a type-I seesaw framework. In this study, we demonstrate how these X-ray constraints can be circumvented through a time-dependent approach, thereby reviving a broad range of active-sterile mixing scenarios. Our minimal model incorporates two right-handed neutrinos, which form a two-component dark matter candidate, and an auxiliary scalar field that experiences a very late and still ongoing phase transition, leading to the spontaneous breaking of a global $ U(1)_N $ symmetry. Prior to this phase transition, only the right-handed neutrinos are massive, while the left-handed neutrinos remain massless because of the scalar field's vanishing expectation value. As the phase transition develops, the growing expectation value of the scalar field increases the active-sterile mixing, thereby opening dark matter decay channels and inducing neutrino masses. The time dependence allows the scenario to be consistent with X-ray constraints as well as current measurements of left-handed neutrino masses. The anticipated level of active-sterile mixing today is within the detection capabilities of the forthcoming TRISTAN (KATRIN) tritium-beta decay project. Additionally, cosmological surveys such as DESI or EUCLID and supernova neutrino observations can test the prediction of massless left-handed neutrinos prior to the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Factorization for $J/\psi$ leptoproduction at small transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonrelativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) breaks down in the region of low transverse momentum, where the transverse momentum of the produced quarkonium state is sensitive to multiple scattering with the incoming hadron and to soft gluon radiation. In this kinematic regime, the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization framework is required, promoting the long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) of NRQCD to the so-called TMD shape functions (TMDShFs), which encode both the soft gluon radiation and the formation of the heavy-quark bound state. In this work, we apply an effective-field theory approach (combining NRQCD and SCET) to the photon-gluon fusion process in inclusive $J/\psi$ leptoproduction. We derive a factorization theorem for the cross section in terms of TMDShFs, compute these quantities at next-to-leading order, establish their evolution, and study their matching onto the corresponding LDMEs in the high-transverse-momentum region. Our results are particularly relevant to the Electron-Ion Collider, where $J/\psi$ leptoproduction can be used to probe gluon transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (gluon TMDPDFs).</description>

      <title>Freeze-in as a Complementary Process to Freeze-Out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many extensions of the Standard Model with a dark matter (DM) candidate obtained via the freeze-out mechanism. It can happen that after all experimental and theoretical constraints are taken into account, all parameter points have a relic density below the experimentally measured value. This means that the models solve only partially the DM problem, and at least one more candidate is needed. In this work we show that it is possible to further extend the model with a DM candidate obtained via the freeze-in mechanism to be in agreement with the relic density experimental measurement. Once the relic density problem is solved with this addition, new questions are raised. This new model with at least two DM candidates could have a freeze-out undetectable DM particle both in direct and indirect detection. This could happen if the freeze-out DM particle would have a very low density. Hence, a collider DM hint via excess in the missing energy with no correspondence in direct and indirect detection experiments, could signal the existence of a Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP). Conversely, if a DM particle is found and a particular model can explain all observables except the correct relic density, an extension with an extra FIMP would solve the problem. The freeze-in DM candidate, due to the small portal couplings, will not change the remaining phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Signatures of supermassive charged gravitinos in liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work two of the present authors have suggested possible experimental ways to search for stable supermassive particles with electric charges of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in upcoming underground experiments and the new JUNO observatory in particular [K.A. Meissner and H. Nicolai, Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf 84}, 269 (2024)]. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the specific signature of such gravitino-induced events for the JUNO detector. The proposed method of detection relies on the `glow' produced by photons during the passage of such particles through the detector liquid, which would last for about a few to a few hundred microseconds depending on its velocity and the track. The cross sections for electronic excitation of the main component of the scintillator liquid, namely linear alkylbenzene (LAB), by the passing gravitino, are evaluated using quantum-chemical methods. The results show that, if such particles exist, the resulting signals would lead to a unique and unmistakable signature, for which we present event simulations as they would be seen by the JUNO photomultipliers. Our analysis brings together two very different research areas, namely fundamental particles physics and the search for a fundamental theory on the one hand, and methods of advanced quantum chemistry on the other.</description>

      <title>QCD Masterclass Lectures on Jet Physics and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures were presented at the 2024 QCD Masterclass in Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, France. They introduce and review fundamental theorems and principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle physics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination. Numerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in detail, including $H\to b\bar b$ identification in fixed-order perturbation theory, generic one- versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power counting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming the central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment expansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet discrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive, infrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to including measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented here are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being a parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon discrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are simultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.</description>

      <title>Helicity-changing Decays of Cosmological Relic Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the possibility that massive neutrinos are unstable due to their invisible decays $\nu^{}_i \to \nu^{}_j + \phi$, where $\nu^{}_i$ and $\nu^{}_j$ (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$) are any two of neutrino mass eigenstates with masses $m^{}_i &gt; m^{}_j$ and $\phi$ is a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson, and explore the implications for the detection of cosmological relic neutrinos in the present Universe. First, we carry out a complete calculation of neutrino decay rates in the general case where the individual helicities of parent and daughter neutrinos are specified. Then, the invisible decays of cosmological relic neutrinos are studied and their impact on the capture rates on the beta-decaying nuclei (e.g., $\nu^{}_e + {^3{\rm H}} \to {^3{\rm He}} + e^-$) is analyzed. The invisible decays of massive neutrinos could substantially change the capture rates in the PTOLEMY-like experiments when compared to the case of stable neutrinos. In particular, we find that the helicity-changing decays of Dirac neutrinos play an important role whereas those of Majorana neutrinos have no practical effects.</description>

      <title>Gluon Sivers function from forward exclusive $\chi_{c1}$ photoproduction on unpolarized protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exclusive production of a $\chi_{c1}$ axial vector quarkonia in photon-proton scattering at high energies requires a $C$-odd $t$-channel exchange. In the limit of vanishing momentum transfer this occurs either via the exchange of a photon, the Primakoff process, where the spin of the proton does not change. For axial-vector meson production, as a consequence of the Landau-Yang theorem, the Primakoff cross section is finite as $t \to 0$. Alternatively, a $C$-odd spin dependent Odderon can be exchanged, which involves a spin flip of the proton. The resulting cross section is related to the square of the gluon Sivers function or its $\boldsymbol{k}_\perp^2$-moment. Using two models for the gluon Sivers function from the literature we compute the ratio of Sivers to Primakoff cross sections and the angular coefficient $\lambda_\theta$ governing the angular distribution of the $\chi_{c1} \to J/\psi + \gamma$ decay as functions of $x$. We point out that these observables constrain the magnitude of the gluon Sivers function at small $x$ which could be accessed in electron-proton scattering and ultraperipheral proton-proton and nucleus-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Representation-Theoretical Characterization of Canonical Custodial Symmetry in NHDM Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering the basis-covariant constituents of N-Higgs-doublet potentials, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for canonical SO(4)_C Custodial Symmetry (CS) of potentials with N&gt;2 doublets, based on representation-theoretical and geometrical relations. In essence, our characterization relates the presence of canonical CS to basis-covariant vectors corresponding to particular bases of the defining representation of the orthogonal Lie algebras. For N=3,4 and 5, the conditions demand little computational effort to be evaluated, and we provide practical algorithms that may be efficiently implemented in a computer program, for deciding whether or not a potential is custodial-symmetric.</description>

      <title>Impact of finite volume on kaon, antikaon, and $\phi$ meson masses and decay width in asymmetric strange hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the impact of finite volume on the in-medium properties of kaons ($K^+$, $K^0$) and antikaons ($K^-$, $\bar{K^0}$), and $\phi$ mesons in the isospin asymmetric strange hadronic medium at finite density and temperature. We use the chiral SU(3) hadronic mean-field model, which accounts for the interactions between baryons through the exchange of scalar ($\sigma, \zeta, \delta $) and vector ($\omega$, $\rho$, $\phi$) fields. To investigate the effects of finite volume, we apply the multiple reflection expansion (MRE) technique for calculations of the density of states. The non-strange scalar field $\sigma$ shows significant variation in an asymmetric medium, while the strange scalar field $\zeta$ shows good dependency in the strange medium. We use the medium-modified masses of kaons and antikaons calculated using the chiral SU(3) model to obtain the masses and decay width of $\phi$ mesons in finite volume hadronic medium. To obtain the masses and decay widths of $\phi$ mesons, an effective Lagrangian approach with $\phi$$K$$\bar{K}$ interactions at one-loop level is used in the present work. We obtain the effective masses and decay widths in the finite volume matter, for the spherical geometry of the medium with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions as well as for the cubic geometry. The finite volume effects are found to be appreciable at high baryon densities.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles in leptonic decays of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility to find the axion-like particles (ALPs) through the leptonic decays of heavy mesons. There are some deviations between the Standard Model (SM) predictions of the branching ratios of the leptonic decays of mesons and the experimental data. This provides some space for the existence of decay channels where the ALP is one of the products. Three scenarios are considered: first, the ALP is only coupled to one single charged fermion, namely, the quark, the antiquark, or the charged lepton; second, the ALP is only coupled to quark and antiquark with the same strength; third, the ALP is coupled to all the charged fermions with the same strength. The constraints of the coupling strength in different scenarios are obtained by comparing the experimental data of the branching ratios of leptonic decays of $B^-$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ mesons with the theoretical predictions which are achieved by using the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) method. These constraints are further applied to predict the upper limits of the leptonic decay processes of the $B_c^-$ meson in which the ALP participates.</description>

      <title>Pion photo-production of nucleon excited states with Hamiltonian effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine our previous calculation of multipole amplitude $E_{0+}$ for pion photo-production process, $\gamma N\rightarrow\pi N$. The treatment of final state interactions is based upon an earlier analysis of pion-nucleon scattering within Hamiltonian effective field theory, supplemented by incorporating contributions from the $N^*(1650)$ and the $K\Lambda$ coupled channel. The contribution from the bare state corresponding to the $N^*(1650)$ significantly enhances our results. Additionally, we also compute the multipole amplitude $M_{1-}$, which is of direct relevance to the Roper resonance. The results are comparable with other dynamical coupled channel models, even though the contribution from the bare state (interpreted as a 2s excitation) in this channel is small because of its large mass.</description>

      <title>An interpretation of scalars in SO(32)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an interpretation for the adjoint representation of the $SO(32)$ group to classify the scalars of a generic Supersymmetric Standard Model having just three generations of particles, via a flavour group $SU(5)$. We show that this same interpretation arises from a simple postulate of self-consistence of composites for these scalars. The model looks only for colour and electric charge, and it pays the cost of an additional chiral $+4/3$ quark per generation.</description>

      <title>Connecting pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter with pseudo-Dirac neutrinos in a left-right symmetry model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stringent constraints from the dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments can be naturally evaded for a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) DM. We propose a realization of pNGB DM in the context of a left-right symmetric model, wherein the neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac in nature. The Dirac mass term for neutrinos arises from two-loop quantum corrections, whereas the Majorana mass terms are generated from Planck-induced corrections. This class of model also provides a parity solution to the strong CP problem without the need for an axion. We show an interesting correlation between the lifetime of the DM and the mass-squared differences between active and sterile neutrinos while maintaining a solution to the strong CP problem.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of the anticharmed-strange pentaquark states: mass spectra, decays, and magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the quark delocalization color screening model, a systematic investigation of the anticharmed-strange pentaquark system is performed using the resonance group method. The currently estimations predict three bound states with estimated masses to be 2886 MeV, 3039 MeV, and 3153 MeV, respectively. Additionally, three resonance states are identified in various scattering phase shifts processes. Among them, two resonance states $\Sigma D$ and $\Sigma^{\ast}D^{\ast}$ with quantum number $\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}^{-})$ are detected in channels $ND_{s}^{\ast}$ and $ND$, and $\Sigma D^{\ast}$ and $\Lambda D$, with masses and decay widths of ($M_{R}=3053\sim3055$ MeV, $T_{total}=13.0\sim13.4$ MeV) and ($M_{R}=3389\sim3390$ MeV, $T_{total}=10.4$ MeV), respectively. In the $\Lambda D^{\ast}$ and $\Sigma D^{\ast}$ channels, a resonance state with quantum number $\frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^{-})$ is discovered, with its mass and decay width being $3250\sim3252$ MeV and 4.4 MeV, respectively. These predicted pentaquark states have $\bar{c}snnn$ quark compositions, allowing them to be recognized as genuine pentaquark states. To validate these predictions, it is expected that upcoming experiments will further explore the predicted resonance and bound states in these possible decay channels.</description>

      <title>Resonant leptogenesis in minimal $U(1)_X$ extensions of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a general $U(1)_X$ scenario where we introduce three generations of Standard Model (SM) singlet Right Handed Neutrinos (RHNs) to generate the light neutrino mass through the seesaw mechanism after the breaking of $U(1)_X$ and electroweak symmetries. In addition to that, a general $U(1)_X$ scenario involves an SM-singlet scalar field and due to the $U(1)_X$ symmetry breaking the mass of a neutral beyond the SM (BSM) gauge boson $Z^\prime$ is evolved. The RHNs, being charged under $U(1)_X$ scenario, can explain the origin of observed baryon asymmetry through the resonant leptogenesis process. Applying observed neutrino oscillation data we study $Z^\prime$ and BSM scalar induced processes to reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry. Hence we estimate bounds on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and the mass of the $Z^\prime$ $(M_{Z^\prime})$ for different $U(1)_X$ charges and benchmark masses of RHN and SM-singlet scalar. Finally we compare our results with limits obtained from the existing limits from LEP-II and LHC. We find that depending on the $U(1)_X$ charges, the masses of RHNs and SM-singlet scalar resonant leptogenesis could provide stronger limit on $g_X$ for $M_{Z^\prime} &gt; 5.8$ TeV which could be probed by high energy scattering experiment in future.</description>

      <title>Confirming the molecule explain for the $\Xi(2030)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its discovery in 1977, the spin-parity of $\Xi(2030)$ has not been fully determined experimentally. The latest Particle Data Group (PDG) listing suggests it may be a baryon with $J=5/2$. Therefore, studying the mass spectrum and decay properties of $\Xi(2030)$ has become a current hot topic to definitively establish its spin-parity. As the three-quark model fails to explain $\Xi(2030)$, we previously proposed it may be a molecule primarily composed of $\bar{K}^{}\Sigma$ with $J^P=5/2^{+}$, based on its mass spectrum study. To verify its molecular state interpretation, this work proposes studying the strong decays of $\Xi(2030)$ assuming it is a $P$-wave $J^P=5/2^{+}$ meson-baryon molecule predominantly composed of $\bar{K}^{}\Sigma$. We calculated all experimentally measured two-body and three-body final state decay widths of $\Xi(2030)$, including $\Xi(2030) \to \bar{K}\Lambda, \bar{K}\Sigma, \pi\Xi, \pi\Xi^{*}$, and $\Xi(2030) \to \pi\pi\Xi, \pi\bar{K}\Sigma, \pi\bar{K}\Lambda$. The results indicate that both the total decay width and partial decay widths agree well with experimental values within the error margins. This supports that $\Xi(2030)$ is a molecule with spin-parity $J^P = 5/2^{+}$, predominantly composed of $\bar{K}^{*}\Sigma$. Compared to the experimental central values, our results are slightly smaller, which suggests that $\Xi(2030)$ may contain additional components besides meson-baryon molecular components, such as three quark structures.</description>

      <title>Modified hybrid inflation in no-scale SUGRA with suppressed $R$-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-motivated cosmological hybrid inflation scenario based on no-scale SUGRA is considered. It is demonstrated that an extra suppressed $R$-symmetry breaking term $S^n$ with $n\geq 4$ needs to be included in order to realize successful inflation. The resulting potential is found to be similar (but not identical) to the one in the Starobinsky inflation model. A relatively larger tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\sim 10^{-2}$ and a spectral index $n_s\approx 0.965$ are obtained, which are approximately independent of $n$.</description>

      <title>Collision energy dependence of elliptic flow of identified hadrons in heavy-ion collisions using the PHSD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first predictions of elliptic flow ($v_2$) of identified hadrons at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt;$ 1.0) in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} =$ 6.7, 8, 11, and 25 A GeV using the Parton Hadron String Dynamics (PHSD) model. The transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) dependence of identified hadron $v_2$ in different centrality intervals (0-10%, 10-40%, and 40-80%) are shown. A clear centrality dependence of $v_2(p_\mathrm{T})$ is observed for particles at $E_{lab} = $ 25 and 11 A GeV, while the centrality dependence becomes weaker for particles at $E_{lab} = $ 8 and 6.7 A GeV. Within the PHSD model, the number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_2$ approximately follows in Au+Au collisions at all beam energies. A collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) dependence of $\pi$, $K$, and $p$ $v_2$ is studied in comparison with available published experimental data in the beam energy range of 6-25 A GeV. These predictions will help in interpreting the data from the forthcoming Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) and Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD) at the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider facility (NICA).</description>

      <title>Transition magnetic moment about neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the neutrino transition magnetic moment in the $U(1)_X$SSM. $U(1)_X$SSM is the $U(1)$ extension of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and its local gauge group is extended to $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_X$. To obtain this model, three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos are added to the MSSM, which can explain the results of neutrino oscillation experiments. The neutrino transition magnetic moment is induced by electroweak radiative corrections. By applying effective Lagrangian method and on-shell scheme, we study the associated Feynman diagrams and the transition magnetic moment of neutrinos in the model. We fit experimental data for neutrino mass variances and mixing angle. Based on the range of data selection, the influences of different sensitive parameters on the results are analysed. The numerical analysis shows that many parameters have an effect on the neutrino transition moment, such as $g_X$, $M_2$, $\lambda_H$ and $g_{YX}$. For our numerical results, the order of magnitude of $\mu_{ij}$ is between $10^{-20}$ and $10^{-19}$.</description>

      <title>$P_c(4457)$ interpreted as a $J^P=1/2^+$ state by $\bar{D}^0\Lambda^+_c(2595)$-$\pi^0 P_c(4312)$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $P_c(4457)$ has been discovered over five years, but the parity of this particle remains undetermined. In this letter we propose a new interpretation for $P_c(4457)$, which is the state generated from the coupled-channel $\bar{D}^0\Lambda_c^{+}(2595)$ and $\pi^0 P_c(4312)$ since they can exchange an almost on-shell $\Sigma_c^+$. In this scenario, the parity of $P_c(4457)$ will be positive, which is different from the candidate of the bound state of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The main decay channel of $P_c(4457)$ in this model is $P_c(4312)\pi$. We propose three processes $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi K_s p \pi^-$, $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi K^- p \pi^0$, and $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi p \pi^- \pi^+ K^-$ to verify $P_c(4457)\to P_c(4312)\pi$.</description>

      <title>Dark Sector Tunneling Field Potentials for a Dark Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All of the significant evidence for dark matter observed thus far has been through its gravitational interactions. After 40 years of direct detection experiments, the parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) as dark matter candidates is rapidly approaching the neutrino floor. In this light, we consider a dark sector that is strongly decoupled from the visible sector, interacting exclusively through gravity. In this model, proposed by Freese and Winkler (arXiv:2302.11579), dark matter can be produced through a first-order phase transition in the dark sector dubbed the Dark Big Bang. In this study we fully determine the allowed region of parameter space for the tunneling potential that leads to the realization of a Dark Big Bang and is consistent with all experimental bounds available.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the neutrino phenomenology in a $\Delta(54)$ discrete flavor symmetry and evaluate the relic abundance of dark matter (DM) and active neutrino-DM mixing angle considering various cosmological constraints. We introduced two Standard Model Higgs particles along with vector-like fermions and a new particle (S) which is a gauge singlet in the Standard Model. This modification leads to a mass matrix that diverges from the tribimaximal neutrino mixing pattern resulting in a non-zero reactor angle ($\theta_{13}$). We also incorporated a $ Z_2 \otimes Z_3 \otimes Z_4$ symmetry for the specific interactions in our model. The additional particle S is a sterile neutrino which is considered to be a probable dark matter candidate with mass in keV range.</description>

      <title>T violation at a future neutrino factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of measuring T (time reversal) violation in a future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. By assuming a neutrino factory as a staging scenario of a muon collider at the J-PARC site, we find that the ${\nu}_e \to {\nu}_{\mu}$ oscillation probabilities can be measured with a good accuracy at the Hyper-Kamiokande detector. By comparing with the probability of the time-reversal process, ${\nu}_{\mu} \to {\nu}_e$, measured at the T2K/T2HK experiments, one can determine the CP phase $\delta$ in the neutrino mixing matrix if $| \sin(\delta)|$ is large enough. The determination of $\delta$ can be made with poor knowledge of the matter density of the earth as T violation is almost insensitive to the matter effects. The comparison of CP and T-violation measurements, ${\it \`a\ la}$ the CPT theorem, provides us with a non-trivial check of the three neutrino paradigm based on the quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Revisiting for maximal flavor violating $Z^{'}_{e\mu}$ and its phenomenology constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violation (LFV), observed conclusively in neutrino oscillations, remains a pivotal area of investigation due to its absence in the Standard Model (SM). Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics explores charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), particularly through new particle candidates such as the $Z^{'}$. This article focuses on maximal LFV interactions facilitated by the $Z^{'}$ boson, specifically targeting its off-diagonal interactions with the first and second generations of charged and neutral leptons. In our ultraviolet (UV) model for the origin of the $Z^{'}$, inspired by the work of [R.Foot \textit{et al.,}~arxiv:hep-ph/9401250], we utilize the discrete $Z_2$ symmetry to investigate the maximal LFV mediated by the $Z^{'}$ between the muon ($\mu$) and electron ($e$) arising from the additional scalars. This symmetry prohibits flavor-conserving interactions between $Z'$ and $\mu^+\mu^-,\, e^+e^-$. In conjunction with collider, $(g-2)_{\mu}, (g-2)_e$, inverse $\mu$ decay and LFV decay constraints, we provide forecasts for anticipated limits derived from processes such as $\nu_\mu N \to \nu_e \mu^+ e^- N$ in neutrino trident experiments like the DUNE experiment. These limits highlight the prospective scope and significance of LFV investigations within these experimental frameworks. From the range of mass between 0.01 GeV and 10 GeV, the most stringent limit arise from $ \textit{B} (\mu \to e + X +\gamma)$ for $M_{Z^{'}} &lt; m_\mu$ while neutrino trident processes constrain effectively as $M_{Z^{'}} \to 10$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Extraction of fissile isotope antineutrino spectra using feedforward neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurement of antineutrino spectra produced by isotope fission in reactors is of great significance for studying neutrino oscillations, refining nuclear databases, and addressing the reactor antineutrino anomaly. This work reports a method utilizing a feedforward neural network (FNN) model to decompose the reconstructed measured prompt energy spectrum observed by a short-baseline reactor neutrino experiment and extract the antineutrino spectra produced by the fission of major isotopes such as $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, $^{239}$Pu, and $^{241}$Pu in a nuclear reactor. We present two training strategies for this model and compare them with the traditional $\chi^2$ minimization method, analyzing the same set of pseudo-data for a total exposure of $(2.9\times 5\times 1800)~\rm{GW_{th}\cdot tons\cdot days}$. The results show that the FNN model not only converges faster and better during the fitting process but also achieves relative errors in the extracted spectra within 1\% in the $2-8$ MeV range, outperforming the $\chi^2$ minimization method. The feasibility and superiority of this method have been validated in this study.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Method for Valence Quark Distributions in Exotic Hadrons: A Study of the $Z_c(3900)$ Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we demonstrate the application of the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) to determine the valence quark distribution of exotic hadrons. Our investigation yields three key findings. Firstly, we observe a significant shift towards smaller Bjorken scale $x$ in the peak position of the valence quark distribution for hadrons with an increasing number of valence quarks, consistent with previous results by Kawamura and Kumano. Secondly, assuming that the $Z_c(3900)$ initially consists of four valence quarks, we employ MEM to determine its initial valence quark distribution, estimating a radius of $r_c=1.276$ fm at an extremely low resolution scale $Q^2$. Furthermore, we identify a notable discrepancy between our computed charge form factor $G_c(q)$ at leading order and the outcomes of hadron molecular state calculations. We propose that this form factor can be extracted from the QCD counting rule cross-section, which is grounded in Generalized Distribution Amplitudes (GDA) linked to the multi-quark states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated light nuclei pair photoproduction in relativistic heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions. As a first attempt, we employ our previously developed quantum electrodynamics model, which incorporates a wave-packet description of initial nuclei, to compute the cross section for proton-antiproton pair photoproduction. The effective vertex for the photon and proton interaction is chosen based on studies of two-photon exchange effects in hadron physics. We present the transverse momentum, invariant mass, and azimuthal angle distributions of proton-antiproton pairs at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV in Au+Au ultraperipheral collisions. We observe a $\cos(2\phi)$ modulation and an almost negligible $\cos(4\phi)$ modulation in the azimuthal angle distribution.

      <title>Constraining $|V_{cs}|$ and physics beyond the Standard Model from exclusive (semi)leptonic charm decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the available data on exclusive leptonic and semileptonic $c\to s\ell^+\nu$ decays within the Standard Model and beyond. Our analysis accounts for theory correlations between the relevant hadronic matrix elements through application of dispersive bounds. We find that, within a global analysis, the dispersive bounds are generally well respected and only mildly affect the extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $|V_{cs}|$. Assuming Standard Model dynamics, we obtain $$
  |V_{cs}| = 0.957 \pm 0.003\,, $$ which is compatible with the HFLAV/PDG reference value $|V_{cs}| = 0.975 \pm 0.006$ at the $2.7\,\sigma$ level. Our findings lead to significant deficits in the second-row and second-column unitarity relations of the CKM matrix. Allowing for beyond the SM contributions in the Weak Effective Theory, we find very strong constraints on potential (pseudo)scalar and tensor effects. However, the data still permits sizeable CP-violating right-handed currents.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrino signatures from pulsar remnants of binary neutron-star mergers: coincident detection prospects with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers are accompanied by multi-messenger emissions, including gravitational wave (GW), neutrino, and electromagnetic signals. Some fraction of BNS mergers may result in a rapidly spinning magnetar as a remnant, which can enhance both the EM and neutrino emissions. In this study, we model the neutrino emissions from such systems and discuss the prospects for detecting the neutrinos coincident with GW signatures. We consider a scenario where a magnetar remnant drives a pulsar wind using its spin energy. The wind interacts with the surrounding kilonova ejecta, forming a nebula filled with non-thermal photons. Ions and nuclei extracted from the magnetar's surface can be accelerated in the polar-cap and the termination-shock regions. We investigate the neutrino fluences resulting from photomeson interactions, where accelerated CR protons interact with the photons in the nebula. Our findings indicate that the peak neutrino fluence is $\sim 10^{-2}\rm GeV~cm^{-2}$ for a source at $40$ Mpc, which is reached approximately $\mathcal{O}( 1-10\ {\rm days})$ post merger. Finally, we examine the potential for GW-triggered stacking searches with IceCube-Gen2 using next-generation GW detectors such as the Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). We conclude that, assuming an optimistic neutrino emission model, a combination of CE+ET would offer a high probability of neutrino detection from these sources within an operational timescale of $\sim 20$ years. In case of non-detection, $2 \sigma$ level constraints on model parameters can be established within similar joint operation timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the innermost regions of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers is mostly limited to spherically symmetric configurations that facilitate the numerical solution of the quantum kinetic equations. In this paper, we simulate neutrino quantum kinetics within a (2+1+1) dimensional setup: we model the flavor evolution during neutrino decoupling from matter in two spatial dimensions, one neutrino momentum variable, and time; taking into account non-forward neutral current and charged current collisions of neutrinos with the matter background, as well as neutrino advection. In order to mimic fluctuations in the neutrino emission and matter background, and explore their effect on the flavor evolution, we introduce perturbations in the collision term as well as in the vacuum term of the Hamiltonian. Because of such perturbations, the initial symmetry of the neutrino field across the simulation annulus is broken and flavor conversion is qualitatively affected, with regions of larger flavor conversion alternating across the simulation annulus. In addition, neutrino advection is responsible for spreading flavor waves across neighboring spatial regions. Although based on a simplified setup, our findings highlight the importance of modeling neutrino quantum kinetics in multi-dimensions to assess the impact of neutrinos on the physics of compact astrophysical sources and nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Chameleon Mechanism in Scalar Nonmetricity Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and the phase-space evolution for the scalar nonmetricity cosmology with a Chameleon mechanism. In particular, we consider a spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker geometry and within the framework of scalar nonmetricity theory, we consider a generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory in nonmetricity gravity. Introducing a pressureless gas as the matter source, we also incorporate a coupling function responsible for the interaction. Our findings reveal that the choice of connection in nonmetricity gravity significantly impacts the interaction between the scalar field and the matter source. For one particular connection, we discover the absence of asymptotic solutions with a nontrivial interacting component. More precisely, in this scenario, the matter source does not directly interact with the scalar field; however, there is an interaction with the dynamical degrees of freedom provided by the connection.</description>

      <title>Statistical Production of $B_c$ Mesons in Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recombination production of $B_c$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energy is facilitated by the abundant and highly thermalized charm ($c$) quarks transported in the deconfined medium created. We study the production of $B_c$ mesons via $c$ and bottom ($b$) quark recombination in a statistical fashion by placing $B_c$ in the position of a member of the family of open $b$ hadrons, which allows us to make quantitative predictions for the modifications of the production fraction ($f_c$) of $B_c$ mesons and its relative production to $B$ mesons in $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at the same energy. The statistical production yield of $B_c$ mesons is converted into the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution with the shape computed from resonance recombination using the $c$- and $b$-quark phase space distributions that have been simulated via Langevin diffusion and constrained by open $c$- and $b$-hadron observables. Supplemented with the component fragmented from $b$-quark spectrum that dominates at high $p_T$, the total $p_T$ spectrum of $B_c$ mesons is obtained and converted into the $p_T$ dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$). Both $f_c$ and the integrated $R_{\rm AA}$ exhibit a $\sim5$-fold enhancement in central Pb-Pb collisions relative to the $pp$ reference. Comparison with data measured by the CMS experiment shows decent agreement within theoretical and experimental uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the speed of sound in quark-gluon plasma is a crucial aspect of understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this study, we investigate the impact of initial-state fluctuations on the extraction of the speed of sound in a quark-gluon plasma in the ultra-central collisions. By employing the TRENTo model for simulating initial conditions, we demonstrate that these fluctuations lead to sizable volume effect, which in turn corrects the measured values of the sound velocity. With respect to realistic conditions of high-energy heavy-ion experiments, we provide quantitative estimate of these corrections.</description>

      <title>Surface and curvature tensions of cold dense quark matter: a term-by-term analysis within the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation of the surface and curvature tensions, $\sigma$ and $\gamma$, of three-flavor cold quark matter using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with vector interactions. Our approach ensures both local and global electric charge neutrality, as well as chemical equilibrium under weak interactions. By employing the multiple reflection expansion formalism to account for finite size effects, we explore the impact of specific input parameters, particularly the vector coupling constant ratio $\eta_V$, the radius $R$ of quark matter droplets, as well as charge-per-baryon ratio $\xi$ of the finite size configurations. We focus on the role of the contributions of each term of the NJL Lagrangian to the surface and curvature tensions in the mean field approximation. We find that the total surface tension exhibits two different density regimes: it remains roughly constant at around $100 \, \mathrm{MeV \, fm^{-2}}$ up to approximately $2-4$ times the nuclear saturation density, and beyond this point, it becomes a steeply increasing function of $n_B$. The total surface and curvature tensions are relatively insensitive to variations in $R$ but are affected by changes in $\xi$ and $\eta_V$. We observe that the largest contribution to $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ comes from the regularized divergent term, making these quantities significantly higher than those obtained within the MIT bag model.</description>

      <title>Positivity properties of scattering amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate positivity properties in quantum field theory (QFT). We find that planar Feynman integrals in QFT, as well as many related quantities, satisfy an infinite number of positivity conditions: the functions, as well as all their signed derivatives, are non-negative in a specified kinematic region. Such functions are known as completely monotonic (CM) in the mathematics literature. A powerful way to certify complete monotonicity is via integral representations. We thus show that it applies to non-planar integrals possessing a Euclidean region, to cosmological correlators, as well as to certain stringy integrals. Motivated by Positive Geometry, we investigate positivity properties in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We present evidence, based on known analytic multi-loop results, that the CM property extends to several physical quantities in this theory. This includes the (suitably normalized) finite remainder function of the six-particle maximally-helicity violating (MHV) amplitude, four-point scattering amplitudes on the Coulomb branch, four-point correlation functions, as well as the angle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension. Our findings are however not limited to supersymmetric theories. It is shown that the CM property holds for the QCD and QED cusp anomalous dimensions, to three and four loops, respectively. We comment on open questions, and on possible numerical applications of complete monotonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by a first-order phase transition at the electroweak scale are detectable by future space-based detectors like LISA. The lifetime of the resulting shock waves plays an important role in determining the intensity of the generated GWs. We have simulated decaying primordial acoustic turbulence in three dimensions and make a prediction for the universal shape of the energy spectrum by using its self-similar decay properties and the shape of individual shock waves. The shape for the spectrum is used to determine the time dependence of the fluid kinetic energy and the energy containing length scale at late times. The inertial range power law is found to be close to the classically predicted $k^{-2}$ and approaches it with increasing Reynolds number. The resulting model for the velocity spectrum and its decay in time is combined with the sound shell model assumptions about the correlations of the velocity field to compute the GW power spectrum for flows that decay in less than the Hubble time. The decay is found to bring about a convergence in the spectral amplitude and the peak power law that leads to a power law shallower than the $k^9$ of the stationary case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hallmark of the 4-parameter generalized entropy is that it can represent various known entropies proposed so far for suitable limits of the parameters, and thus the 4-parameter generalized entropy can be applied on additive as well as on non-additive systems. Thereafter the proposal of the generalized entropy, it becomes important to constrain the corresponding parameters. In the present work, we intend to do this from the perspective of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated during inflation. In the background level, the generalized entropy successfully drives a viable and smooth evolution of the universe, particularly from inflation to reheating followed by a radiation era, for certain ranges of the entropic parameters. Consequently we investigate whether such viable ranges of the entropic parameters (coming from the background level) allow the primordial GWs spectrum to pass through the sensitivity curves of various GWs observatories. Therefore, if the future observatories can detect the signal of primordial GWs, then our theoretical expectation carried in the present work may provide a possible tool for the measurement of the generalized entropic parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A thorough MCMC analysis of any inflationary model against the current cosmological data is essential for assessing the validity of such a model as a viable inflationary model. Warm Inflation, producing both thermal and quantum fluctuations, yield a complex form of scalar power spectrum, which, in general, cannot be directly written as a function of the comoving wavenumber $k$, an essential step to incorporate the primordial spectra into CAMB to do an MCMC analysis through CosmoMC/Cobaya. In this paper, we devised an efficient generalized methodology to mould the WI power spectra as a function of $k$, without the need of slow-roll approximation of the inflationary dynamics. The methodology is directly applicable to any Warm Inflation model, including the ones with complex forms of the dissipative coefficient and the inflaton potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) with wave numbers larger than the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation are originated from the ultraviolet (UV) modes, which are never stretched out of the horizon. Such a UV tail of the PGW energy spectrum has a spurious logarithmic divergence. We study the origin of such a divergence, and find that it comes from the instantaneous inflation-to-post-inflation transition, which can be removed by considering a finite duration. For the first time, we obtain a semi-analytical expression for the PGW energy spectrum. We find that the UV tail decays exponentially, while the decay rate depends solely on the transition rate. When there is a stiff post-inflationary stage, the enhanced PGW displays a characteristic spectral shape of power-law increasing and exponential decaying. We propose a fitting formula which can be used for signal searching.</description>

      <title>Exact Diffeomorphism in Warped Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the manifestation of exact diffeomorphism in warped extra dimension, with an emphasis on the Randall-Sundrum model. Utilizing the covariant form of variation $\delta g_{MN} = \nabla_M \xi_N + \nabla_N \xi_M$, we derive the nonlinear transformation rules for the metric fields in the unitary gauge. As an off-shell symmetry, diffeomorphism governs the interaction structure by connecting the neighboring orders of bulk action expansions. Our analysis unveils that an on-shell diffeomorphism exists prior to radion stabilization, but is broken by the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. This on-shell symmetry enforces a mass-related equation $F'- A' G =0$ to eliminate one degree of freedom, while ensuring the 5D action invariant up to a surface term. Therefore, we conjecture that the on-shell diffeomorphism actually protects the radion field from acquiring mass.</description>

      <title>An $E_8 \otimes E_8$ Unification of the Standard Model with Pre-Gravitation, on an Exceptional Lie algebra - Valued Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an $E_8 \otimes E_8$ unification of the standard model with pre-gravitation, on an exceptional Lie algebra-valued space. Each of the $E_8$ has in its branching an $SU(3)$ for space-time and an $SU(3)$ for three fermion generations. The first $E_8$ further branches to the standard model $SU(3)_c \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ and describes the gauge bosons, Higgs and the left chiral fermions of the standard model. The second $E_8$ further branches into a right-handed counterpart (pre-gravitation) $SU(3)_{grav}\otimes SU(2)_R \otimes U(1)_g$ of the standard model, and describes right chiral fermions, a Higgs, and twelve gauge bosons associated with pre-gravitation, from which general relativity is emergent. We account for 208 out of the 496 degrees of freedom of $E_8 \otimes E_8$ and propose an interpretation for the remaining 288, motivated by the trace dynamics Lagrangian of our theory. We explain how the two copies of $SU(3)_{spacetime}$ together give rise to a 6D spacetime with signature $(3,3)$ which upon symmetry breaking gives rise to our 4D spacetime and to a second 4D anti-spacetime with flipped signature.</description>

      <title>Flavor Physics Constraints on Left-Right Symmetric Models with Universal Seesaw</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological constraints on the parameter space in the parity symmetric scenario of a class of left-right symmetric models in which the fermion masses are generated through a universal seesaw mechanism. The model, motivated by the axionless solution to the strong $\mathcal{CP}$ problem, has a simple Higgs sector consisting of left- and right-handed doublets. The fermion masses are then generated through their mixing with heavy vector-like fermions, which leads to flavor changing neutral currents arising at tree-level and also introduces non-unitarity in the charged current interactions. These new contributions lead to flavor and flavor universality violating processes and forbidden decays, which are used to derive constraints on the parameter space of the model. We also argue that although the model has the potential to resolve flavor anomalies, it fails to do so in the case of B-anomalies $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and anomalous magnetic moment of muon $(g-2)_\mu$.</description>

State-of-the-art techniques are based on machine learning and require training data with events that have been matched using simulations with truth information. In nature, there is no unique matching between partons and final state objects due to the properties of the strong force and due to acceptance effects. We propose a new approach to parton labeling that circumvents these challenges by recycling regression models. The final state objects that are most relevant for a regression model to predict the properties of a particular top quark are assigned to said parent particle without having any parton-matched training data. This approach is demonstrated using simulated events with top quarks and outperforms the widely-used $\chi^2$ method.</description>

      <title>The spin alignment of vector mesons with light front quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global spin alignment of the vector meson has been observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions, but is still on hot debates in the theoretical community. Here we propose to apply the light front framework to explain this phenomenon since the light front form explicitly describes the hadron spin including both the quark spin and the orbital angular momentum. After applying the light front spinor, we find that the spin alignment in the polarization of vector mesons with $\rho_{00}&gt;1/3$ can be naturally manifested and in particular, the obtained spin alignment for $\phi$ meson is in good agreement with the experimental data. This implies that to explain the spin alignment it is important to properly include the contribution from the gluon interactions that are presented in terms of the orbital angular momentum of the hadron bound state.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric response of a hot and weakly magnetized anisotropic QCD medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients of a weakly magnetized hot QCD medium having a weak momentum anisotropy within the kinetic theory approach. The thermal medium effects have been incorporated in the framework of a quasi-particle model where the medium dependent mass of the quark has been calculated using perturbative thermal QCD in the presence of a weak magnetic field which leads to different masses for the left ($L$) and right ($R$) handed chiral quark modes. We have found that the Seebeck and Nernst coefficient magnitudes for the individual quark flavors as well as for the composite medium are decreasing functions of temperature and decreasing functions of anisotropy strength. The Nernst coefficient magnitudes are about an order of magnitude smaller than their Seebeck counterparts, indicating the Seebeck effect constitutes a stronger response than the Nernst effect. The average percentage change corresponding to switching between quasiparticle modes ($L\to R$ or $R\to L$) is an order of magnitude smaller for Nernst coefficients, compared to the Seebeck coefficients.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the flavor symmetric scoto-seesaw model with dark matter and TM$_1$ mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid scoto-seesaw model based on the $A_4$ non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetry. Light neutrino masses come from the tree-level type-I seesaw mechanism and from the one-loop scotogenic contribution accommodating viable dark matter candidates responsible for observed relic abundance of dark matter (DM). Respectively, both these contributions restore the atmospheric and solar neutrino mass scales. With only one right-handed neutrino, the model features specific predictions with the normal ordering of light neutrino masses, the lightest neutrino being massless, and only one relevant CP Majorana phase. The flavor symmetric setup helps us to realize the TM$_1$ mixing scheme with concrete correlations and constraints on the mixing angles and associated CP phases. The framework predicts the atmospheric mixing angle to be in the upper octant with specific ranges $0.531 (0.580) \leq \sin^2\theta_{23}\leq 0.544 (0.595)$ and the Dirac CP phase is restricted within the range $\pm(1.44-1.12)$ radian. The Majorana phase is also tightly constrained with a range of $0.82-0.95$ and $1.58-1.67$ radian, which is otherwise unconstrained from neutrino oscillations. Strict predictions on the Majorana phases also yield an accurate prediction for the effective mass parameter for neutrinoless double beta within the range of $1.61-3.85$ meV. The model offers a rich phenomenology regarding DM relic density and direct search constraints, and the fermionic DM scenario has been discussed in detail, estimating its possible connection with the neutrino sector. As an example of the model studies at colliders, the SM Higgs in the diphoton decay channel is examined. The model predicts strictly vanishing $\tau \to e\gamma$, $\tau \rightarrow 3e$ decays and testable signals by MEG-II and SINDRUM/Mu3e experiments for the $\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\mu \to 3 e$ decays, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) on the complex plane, which was treated in our previous research, to finite temperature. As a simple example, we solve the SDE for a model with four-fermion interactions in the (1+1) space-time dimensions at strong coupling region. We investigate the properties of the effective mass and energy for the fermions, especially near the phase transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Identifying regions in wide-angle scattering via graph-theoretical approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The method of regions, which provides a systematic approach for computing Feynman integrals involving multiple kinematic scales, proposes that a Feynman integral can be approximated and even reproduced by summing over integrals expanded in certain regions. A modern perspective of the method of regions considers any given Feynman integral as a specific Newton polytope, defined as the convex hull of the points associated with Symanzik polynomials. The regions then correspond one-to-one with the lower facets of this polytope.
  As Symanzik polynomials correspond to the spanning trees and spanning 2-trees of the Feynman graph, a graph-theoretical study of these polynomials may allow us to identify the complete set of regions for a given expansion. In this work, our primary focus is on three specific expansions: the on-shell expansion of generic wide-angle scattering, the soft expansion of generic wide-angle scattering, and the mass expansion of heavy-to-light decay. For each of these expansions, we employ graph-theoretical approaches to derive the generic forms of the regions involved in the method of regions. The results, applicable to all orders, offer insights that can be leveraged to investigate various aspects of scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a method to reconstruct full rapidity distributions of charged particle multiplicity and net proton yields, crucial for constraining the longitudinal dynamics of nuclear matter created in the beam energy scan program. Employing rapidity distributions within a multistage hydrodynamic model calibrated for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=7.7-200\,$GeV, we estimate the total energy and baryon number deposited into the collision fireball, offering insights into initial dynamics and the identification of nuclear remnants. We explore the potential of rapidity-dependent measurements in probing equations of state at finite chemical potentials. Furthermore, we compare the freeze-out parameters derived from both hydrodynamics and thermal models, highlighting that the parameters extracted via thermal models represent averaged properties across rapidities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unique topological portal between quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and a dark sector characterized by a global symmetry breaking, which connects three QCD to two dark pions. When gauged, it serves as the leading portal between the two sectors, providing an elegant, self-consistent scenario of light thermal inelastic dark matter. The inherent antisymmetrization leads to diminished annihilations at later times and suppressed direct detection. However, novel collider signatures offer tremendous prospects for discovery at Belle II.</description>

Abstract: Strongly-interacting dark matter can be accumulated in large quantities inside the Earth, and for dark matter particles in a few GeV mass range, it can exist in large quantities near the Earth's surface. We investigate the constraints imposed on such dark matter properties by its upscattering by fast neutrons in nuclear reactors with subsequent scattering in nearby well-shielded dark matter detectors, schemes which are already used for searches of the coherent reactor neutrino scattering. We find that the existing experiments cover new parameter space on the spin-dependent interaction between dark matter and the nucleon. Similar experiments performed with research reactors, and lesser amount of shielding, may provide additional sensitivity to strongly-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrino-DM interactions with Milky Way dwarf spheroidals and supernova neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain the neutrino-dark matter cross section using properties of the dark matter density profiles of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The constraint arises from core-collapse supernova neutrinos scattering on dark matter as a form of energy injection, allowing the transformation of the dark matter density profile from a cusped profile to a flatter profile. We assume a standard cosmology of dark energy and cold, collisionless, and non-self-interacting dark matter. By requiring that the dark matter cores do not lose too much mass or overshoot constraints from stellar kinematics, we place an upper limit on the cross section of $\sigma_{\nu-\mathrm{DM}}(E_\nu=15 \, \mathrm{MeV}, m_\chi\lesssim130 \, \mathrm{GeV}) \approx 3.4 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{cm^2}$ and $\sigma_{\nu-\mathrm{DM}}(E_\nu=15 \, \mathrm{MeV}, m_\chi\gtrsim130 \, \mathrm{GeV}) \approx 3.2 \times 10^{-27} \left( \frac{m_\chi}{1\,\mathrm{GeV}}\right)^2\, \mathrm{cm^2}$, which is stronger than previous bounds for these energies. Consideration of baryonic feedback or host galaxy effects on the dark matter profile can strengthen this constraint.</description>

      <title>Polarized and unpolarized off-shell $H^\ast\to ZZ\rightarrow 4\ell$ decay above the $2m_Z$ threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analysis of the off-shell $H^\ast\rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow \overline{\ell}_1\ell_1\overline{\ell}_2\ell_2$ decay width is presented for both unpolarized and polarized $Z$ gauge bosons in the scenario with the most general $H^*ZZ$ vertex function, which is given in terms of two $CP$-even ($\hat b_Z$ and $\hat c_Z$) and one $CP$-odd ($\tilde b_Z$) anomalous couplings.
  The SM contributions to the $H^*ZZ$ coupling up to the one-loop level are also included. Explicit analytic results for the unpolarized and polarized $H^\ast\rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow \overline{\ell}_1\ell_1\overline{\ell}_2\ell_2$ square amplitudes and the four-body phase space are presented, out of which several observable quantities can be obtained straightforwardly. As far as the numerical analysis is concerned, a cross-check is performed via \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, where our model was implemented with the aid of FeynRules. We then consider the most stringent bounds on anomalous complex $H^*ZZ$ couplings and analyze the effects of the polarizations of the $Z$ gauge bosons through the polarized $H^\ast\rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow \overline{\ell}_1\ell_1\overline{\ell}_2\ell_2$ decay width as well as left-right and forward-backward asymmetries, which are found to be sensitive to new-physics effects. Particular focus is put on the effects of the absorptive parts of the anomalous $H^*ZZ$ couplings, which have been largely overlooked up to now in LHC analyses. It is found that the studied observable quantities, particularly the left-right asymmetries, can be helpful to look for effects of $CP$-violation in the $H^*ZZ$ coupling and set bounds on the absorptive parts. For completeness, we also analyze the case of unpolarized $Z$ gauge bosons.</description>

Abstract: We extend the local infrared-divergence subtraction formalism, originally proposed by Frixione, Kunszt and Signer (FKS), to calculate short-distance (differential) cross section for any inclusive process involving a quarkonium particle in non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorisation at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. The new formulas are generally applicable to the production of an S- or P-wave quarkonium state in association with any number of elementary particles. The main new ingredients derived in this paper are the local and integrated soft counterterms for the colour-singlet and colour-octet P-wave bound states. It, therefore, paves the way to the automation of the NLO calculations for heavy quarkonium inclusive and associated production processes.</description>

      <title>Scalar dark matter explanation of the excess in the Belle II $B^+\to K^+ +$ invisible measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Belle II reported the first measurement of $B^+\to K^++{\rm invisible (inv)}$, which is $2.7\sigma$ above the standard model (SM) prediction. If confirmed, this calls for new physics beyond SM. In the SM, the invisible particles are neutrino-anti-neutrino pairs. There are more possibilities when going beyond the SM. In this work, we focus on decays to dark matter (DM) and show that the $B\to K +\mathrm{inv}$ excess from Belle II and DM relic density can be simultaneously explained in a simple extension of the SM. The model introduces a real scalar singlet $\phi$ acting as a DM candidate, and two heavy vector-like quarks $Q,D$ with the same quantum numbers as the SM left-handed quark doublet and right-handed down-type quark singlet, respectively. All these new particles are odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry while the SM particles are even. The model can successfully explain the Belle II anomaly and DM relic density for TeV-scale heavy quarks with hierarchical Yukawa couplings involving $b$ and $s$ quarks. At the same time, it can easily satisfy other flavour physics constraints. Direct detection searches utilizing the Migdal effect constrain some of the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves from a binary merger involving a potential low-mass gap black hole (LMBH) by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration motivates investigations into mechanisms beyond conventional stellar evolution theories to account for their existence. We study a mechanism in which dark matter (DM), through its capture and accumulation inside main sequence stars, induces the formation of black holes within the mass range of $[3, 5]M_\odot$. We examine the distribution of these LMBHs as a function of galaxy halo mass, particularly when paired with neutron stars. This gives a distinct signature that can be tested with future gravitational wave observations. We find that a viable portion of the DM parameter space predicts a merger rate of such binaries consistent with LVK observations.</description>

Abstract: A global interpretation of several significant indications of scalar resonances observed at LHC is achieved using the Georgi Machacek model. Among many other consequences, one predicts large cross sections for the processes ggFH(320)-&gt;h(125)h(125) and A(151)A(151) and ggF-&gt;A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z, where H(320) has been observed in A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z-&gt;bbbbl+l- and where A(151) is observed into two photons accompanied by a b jet, a lepton or missing transverse energy. We predict that ggF-&gt;H(320) has a cross section of about 2000 fb with a BR into h(125)(125) of 17% and into A(151)A(151) of 45%. Henceforth we predict that ggF-&gt;H(320)-&gt;hh will dominate over the SM process h*-&gt;hh, where h is the SM h(125) scalar. One expects that H(320)-&gt;A(151)A(151) can be observed into bbbb, becoming one of the most significant BSM phenomena identified so far. Arguments in favor of a SUSY version of GM are also provided.</description>

      <title>Strange quark matter as dark matter: 40 years later, a reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forty years ago, Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit both the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe and the many phenomenological implications of their existence. Most of the paper discusses the limits on their mass distribution and a possible and simple scheme for their production. Finally, we discuss the most promising techniques to detect this type of objects.</description>

      <title>Gauged Q-ball dark matter through a cosmological first-order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a new type of dynamical dark matter mechanism, we discuss the stability of the gauged Q-ball dark matter and its production mechanism through a cosmological first-order phase transition. This work delves into the study of gauged Q-ball dark matter generated during the cosmic phase transition. We demonstrate detailed discussions on the stability of gauged Q-balls to rigorously constrain their charge and mass ranges. Additionally, employing analytic approximations and the mapping method, we provide qualitative insights into gauged Q-balls. We establish an upper limit on the gauge coupling constant and give the relic density of stable gauged Q-ball dark matter formed during a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, we discuss potential observational signatures or constraints of gauged Q-ball dark matter, including astronomical observations and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>New bounds on heavy axions with an X-ray free electron laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range 10^{-3} eV &lt; m_a &lt; 10^{4} eV. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been performed previously at a 3^rd generation synchrotron [1], our work demonstrates improved sensitivity, exploiting the higher brightness of X-rays at EuXFEL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong CP violation problem has a long history emanating from its discovery 60 years ago in the decay of neutral kaons and subsequent experimental and theoretical studies over several decades. We review herein experimental data that observe indirect CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-3}$, as well as the discovery of direct CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-6}$. Despite improved experimental methods over the past half a century, the original CP violation numbers have remained the same. Verification of the CP violation in the decay of charged kaons was also observed. Data reflecting CP violation in the decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons have become very important and are also discussed in this review. The question of CP violation only with the participation of $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, and $b\bar{b}$ quarks in the framework of the Standard Model or beyond it and its small magnitude remains open.</description>

Abstract: Generalized thermodynamic relations are introduced into the framework of a relativistic perfect spin hydrodynamics. They allow for consistent treatment of spin degrees of freedom, including the use of spin tensors whose structure follows from microscopic calculations. The obtained results are important for establishing consistency between different formulations of spin hydrodynamics and form the basis for introducing dissipative corrections.</description>

      <title>Enhanced tunable cavity development for axion dark matter searches using a piezoelectric motor in combination with gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most search experiments sensitive to quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion dark matter benefit from microwave cavities, as electromagnetic resonators, that enhance the detectable axion signal power and thus the experimental sensitivity drastically. As the possible axion mass spans multiple orders of magnitude, microwave cavities must be tunable and it is desirable for the cavity to have a tunable frequency range that is as wide as possible. Since the tunable frequency range generally increases as the dimension of the conductor tuning rod increases for a given cylindrical conductor cavity system, we developed a cavity system with a large dimensional tuning rod in order to increase this. We, for the first time, employed not only a piezoelectric motor, but also gears to drive a large and accordingly heavy tuning rod, where such a combination to increase driving power can be adopted for extreme environments as is the case for axion dark matter experiments: cryogenic, high-magnetic-field, and high vacuum. Thanks to such higher power derived from the piezoelectric motor and gear combination, we realized a wideband tunable cavity whose frequency range is about 42\% of the central resonant frequency of the cavity, without sacrificing the experimental sensitivity too much.</description>

      <title>Analytical approximations as close as desired to special functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing global analytical expressions that approximate a function over its entire range. These approximations not only mirror the original function as accurately as desired, but are purposefully created to possess features that the original function lacks. This is particularly useful for functions that lack closed form and are defined by integrals or infinite series. Replacing these definitions with simple analytical expressions enables in-depth qualitative analysis and replaces the current methods of evaluation. We demonstrate this procedure by providing replacements for a variety of pivotal functions in physics and cosmology including the pressure and density of quantum gas, the one-loop correction in thermal field theory, common polylog functions, and the error function.</description>

Abstract: The TNMSSM is an attractive extension of the Standard Model. It combines the advantages of the NMSSM and the TMSSM to give three tiny Majorana neutrinos masses via a type I+II seesaw mechanism. With the on-shell renormalization scheme, we consider the neutrino masses up to one loop approximation. Applying the effective Lagrangian method, we study the transition magnetic moments of Majorana neutrinos and consider the normal hierarchy (NH) and inverse hierarchy (IH) neutrino mass spectra within the constraints of experimental data on neutrino oscillations. The solar neutrino transition magnetic moment is further deduced, and compared with the XENONnT experiment limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP violation in baryon decays has recently garnered significant attention. Traditionally, CP violation in charmed baryon decays is predicted to be at the order of $O(10^{-4})$. Utilizing recent measurements from BESIII, Belle and Belle~II experiments, we conduct a comprehensive global analysis to estimate the contribution of topological diagrams in these processes. Our study reveals that topological diagrams alone cannot fully account for the experimental data. By incorporating new effects that are not included in traditional topological diagrams and exploring a novel way to determine the possible new weak phase, our analysis reveals the potential for significant CP violation in $\Lambda_c^+\to p \eta/ n \pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^+\to \Xi^0 K^+$. This suggests a promising opportunity to observe CP violation for the first time in charmed baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Vector-like Quark Stabilised Higgs Inflation: Implications for Particle Phenomenology, Primordial Gravitational Waves and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model Higgs potential is very likely to be metastable, in which case Higgs Inflation is likely to require an extension in order to stabilise the potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$: $T$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, 2/3)$ and $B$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, -1/3)$. Requiring stability of the finite-temperature effective potential, and assuming $m_{t}$ equals its mean value, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The corresponding absolute stability upper bounds are 4.4 TeV and 29 TeV. Small upper bounds are obtained for $B$ quarks. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger constraint on $m_{Q}$, with the $T$ quark upper bound equal to 2.4 TeV for $n_{Q} = 2$ and 13 TeV for $n_{Q} = 3$. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Non-minimally Coupled Scalar Fields in the Jordan Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.08388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of scalar fields with non-minimal gravitational interactions of the form $\xi |\phi|^2 R$ may have important implications for the physics of the early universe. While many studies solve the dynamics of non-minimally coupled scalars in the Einstein frame, where gravity is simply described by the Einstein-Hilbert action, we instead propose a procedure to solve the dynamics directly in the original Jordan frame where the non-minimal couplings are maintained explicitly. Our algorithm can be applied to scenarios that include minimally coupled fields and an arbitrary number of non-minimally coupled scalars, with the expansion of the universe sourced by all fields present. This includes situations when the dynamics become fully inhomogeneous, fully non-linear (due to e.g.~backreaction or mode rescattering effects), and/or when the expansion of the universe is dominated by non-minimally coupled species. As an example, we study geometric preheating with a non-minimally coupled scalar spectator field when the inflaton oscillates following the end of inflation. In the future, our technique may be used to shed light on aspects of the equivalence of the Jordan and Einstein frames at the quantum level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model of $N$ 4-component massless fermions in a quartic self-interaction based on ref. \cite{gomes2022} is investigated in the presence of chemical potential and temperature via optimized perturbation theory that accesses finite-N contributions. We use the generating functional approach to calculate the corrections to the effective potential of the model. The model introduces an auxiliary pseudo-vector field with a nontrivial minimum and is influenced by temperature $(T)$ and chemical potential $(\mu)$. These thermodynamic quantities are introduced through Matsubara formalism. Thereby, the integrals are modified, and via the principle of minimum sensitivity, we obtain the gap equations of the model. The correspondent finite-N solutions of these equations define the vacuum states of the model associated with the background pseudo-vector field. In particular, one focuses on its temporal component that acts as an effective chiral chemical potential. We discuss the solutions of the four cases in which $(T = 0,\mu = 0)$, $(T \neq 0,\mu \neq 0)$, $(T \neq 0,\mu = 0)$ and $(T = 0,\mu \neq 0)$, where the effective potential is so obtained as a function of the background vector field, the chemical potential, and the temperature. The model shows the finite-N corrections generate first-order phase transitions on the self-interacting fermions for the case $N=1$ and the persistence of a second-order phase transition for $N \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Features in the Inflaton Potential and the Spectrum of Cosmological Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbations, originating in the quantum fluctuations of the fields that drive inflation, are observed to be nearly scale invariant at the largest scales. At smaller scales, however, perturbations are not severely constrained and might be of particular importance if their amplitude is large. They can trigger the creation of primordial black holes (PBHs) or stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Small-scale perturbations are generated during the later stages of inflation, when possible strong features in the inflaton potential can break scale invariance and leave characteristic imprints on the spectrum. We focus on and review three types of features: inflection points and steep steps in the potential, as well as sharp turns in the inflationary trajectory in field space. We show that such features induce a strong enhancement of the curvature spectrum within a certain wavenumber range. In particular cases, they also generate characteristic oscillatory patterns that are transferred in the spectrum of secondary GWs, which are potentially observable by operating or designed experiments. We demonstrate these effects through the calculation of the primordial power spectrum and the PBH abundance in the context of $\alpha$-attractors and supergravity (SUGRA) models of inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a novel study to obtain the initial spin of the primordial black holes created during a first-order phase transition due to delayed false vacuum decay. Remaining within the parameter space consistent with observational bounds, we express the abundance and the initial spin of the primordial black holes as functions of the phase transition parameters. The abundance of the primordial black holes is extremely sensitive to the phase transition parameters. We also find that the initial spin weakly depends on all parameters except the transition temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic magnification is able to probe the geometry of large scale structure on cosmological scales, thereby providing another window for probing theories of the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. It holds the potential to reveal new information on the nature of dark energy and modified gravity. By using the angular power spectrum, with all known relativistic corrections incorporated, we investigated cosmic magnification in beyond-Horndeski gravity. We probed both the total relativistic signal, and the individual relativistic signals. Our results suggest that surveys at low redshifts ($z \,{\lesssim}\, 0.5$) will be able to measure directly the total relativistic signal in the total magnification angular power spectrum without the need for multi-tracer analysis (to beat down cosmic variance). Similarly, for the Doppler signal, our results indicate that it can also be measured directly at the given low redshifts. However, for the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the (gravitational) potential signals, respectively, it will require going to high redshifts ($z \,{\gtrsim}\, 3$) for the signals to surpass cosmic variance. For actual detectability though, proper quantitative methods and error analysis (not considered in this work) will need to be taken into account, i.e. in addition to cosmic variance. We also found that the beyond-Horndeski gravity boosts relativistic effects; consequently, cosmic magnification. Conversely, relativistic effects enhance the potential of the total magnification angular power spectrum to detect the imprint of beyond-Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <title>System size and shape dependences of collective flow fluctuations in relativistic nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations plays an essential role in forming the collective flow of hadrons observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Event-by-event fluctuations of the collective flow can arise from various sources, such as the fluctuations in the initial geometry, hydrodynamic expansion, hadronization, and hadronic evolution of the nuclear matter, while the exact contribution from each source is still an open question. Using a (3+1)-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic model coupled to a Monte-Carlo Glauber initial condition, Cooper-Frye particlization and a hadronic transport model, we explore the system size and shape dependences of the collective flow fluctuations in Au+Au, Cu+Au, and O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$~GeV. The particle yields, mean transverse momenta, 2-particle and 4-particle cumulant elliptic flows ($v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$) from our calculation agree with the currently existing data from RHIC. Different centrality dependences of the flow fluctuations, quantified by the $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ ratio, are found for different collision systems due to their different sizes and shapes. By comparing $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ between different hadron species, and comparing $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ to the initial state geometric fluctuations quantified by the cumulant eccentricity ratio $\varepsilon_2\{4\}/\varepsilon_2\{2\}$, we find that while the initial state fluctuations are the main source of the $v_2$ fluctuations in large collision systems, other sources like nonlinear hydrodynamic response, hadronization, and hadronic afterburner can significantly affect the $v_2$ fluctuations in small systems.</description>

Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <title>Quintessential interpretation of the evolving dark energy in light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature renormalization of Standard Model coupled with gravity, and its implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metrics, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. Notably, this method also provides an effective tool for addressing one of the longstanding problems in QCD, the Linde problem. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dressing vs. Fixing: On How to Extract and Interpret Gauge-Invariant Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is solid consensus among physicists and philosophers that, in gauge field theory, for a quantity to be physically meaningful or real, it must be gauge-invariant. Yet, every "elementary" field in the Standard Model of particle physics is actually gauge-variant. This has led a number of researchers to insist that new manifestly gauge-invariant approaches must be established. Indeed, in the foundational literature, dissatisfaction with standard methods for reducing gauge symmetries has been expressed: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is deemed conceptually dubious, while gauge fixing suffers the same limitations and is subject to the same criticisms as coordinate choices in General Relativity.
  An alternative gauge-invariant proposal was recently introduced in the literature, the so-called "dressing field method" (DFM). It is a mathematically subtle tool, and unfortunately prone to be confused with simple gauge transformations, hence with standard gauge~fixings. As a matter of fact, in the physics literature the two are often conflated, and in the philosophy community some doubts have been raised about whether there is any substantial difference between them. Clarifying this issue is of special significance for anyone interested in both the foundational issues of gauge theories and their invariant formulation. It is thus our objective to establish as precisely as possible the technical and conceptual distinctions between the DFM and gauge fixing.</description>

Abstract: Basic idea of $CP$ violation and its importance for cosmology, Standard Model and possible New Physics are introduced. Recent (2019) discovery of CP violation in charm in the $\Delta A_{CP}$ between $D^0\rightarrow K^-K^+$ and $D^0\rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-$ decay channels and evidence for direct CP violation in $D^0\rightarrow \pi^-\pi^+$ decays in 2023 is discussed. Motivation and brief outline for search of CP violation in the $D^0\rightarrow V\gamma$, where $V=\phi,\rho^0, \bar{K}^{*0}$ decays is given.</description>

      <title>Jet Flavour Tagging at FCC-ee with a Transformer-based Neural Network: DeepJetTransformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet flavour tagging is crucial in experimental high-energy physics. A tagging algorithm, DeepJetTransformer, is presented, which exploits a transformer-based neural network that is substantially faster to train.
  The DeepJetTransformer network uses information from particle flow-style objects and secondary vertex reconstruction as is standard for $b$- and $c$-jet identification supplemented by additional information, such as reconstructed V$^0$s and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination, typically not included in tagging algorithms at the LHC. The model is trained as a multiclassifier to identify all quark flavours separately and performs excellently in identifying $b$- and $c$-jets. An $s$-tagging efficiency of $40\%$ can be achieved with a $10\%$ $ud$-jet background efficiency. The impact of including V$^0$s and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination is presented.
  The network is applied on exclusive $Z \to q\bar{q}$ samples to examine the physics potential and is shown to isolate $Z \to s\bar{s}$ events. Assuming all other backgrounds can be efficiently rejected, a $5\sigma$ discovery significance for $Z \to s\bar{s}$ can be achieved with an integrated luminosity of $60~\text{nb}^{-1}$, corresponding to less than a second of the FCC-ee run plan at the $Z$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Covariant quantum field theory of tachyons"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Paczos et al. (Phys. Rev. D 109 (2024)) proposed a covariant quantum field theory for free and interacting tachyon fields. We show that the proposed Feynman propagator leads to unitarity violation in the 1-loop mass renormalization of an ordinary particle it interacts with, proper asymptotic (in/out) tachyon states do not exist, and the proposed S-matrix describing interactions of tachyons and subluminal matter is ill-defined. Since tachyons behave as bosons, interacting tachyons may also self-interact, e.g., any interaction with ordinary matter generates such terms. As a result, the physical vacuum, instead of being at the origin of the potential, may correspond to the proper minimum of the tachyon potential, or such state does not exist at all. Our analysis indicates that quantum tachyon field does not describe a physical on-shell particle with negative mass squared.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the earliest stage of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the produced matter is a highly populated system of gluons called glasma which can be approximately described in terms of classical chromodynamic fields. Although the system's dynamics is governed by Yang-Mills equations, glasma evolution is shown to strongly resemble hydrodynamic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>
