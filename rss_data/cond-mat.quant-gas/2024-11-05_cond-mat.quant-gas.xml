      <title>Macroscopic superposition of vortex states in a matter wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating the vortex-state superposition in a matter wave is demanded in many quantum processes such as quantum memory and quantum metrology. Here we report the experimental generation of macroscopic superposition of vortex states in ultracold quantum gases. By transferring an optical vortex-state superposition to the center-of-mass rotational state of ultracold atoms using the Raman coupling technique, we realize two-vortex and three-vortex superposition states in quantum gases, demonstrating the high dimensionality of the vortex state. We show the controllability of the superposition states on the Bloch sphere. The lifetime of the vortex superposition state in quantum gases is as large as 25 ms, about two orders of magnitude longer than the storage time in atomic ensembles. This work paves the way for high dimensional quantum processing in matter waves.</description>

      <title>Tightly bound solitons and vortices in three-dimensional bosonic condensates with the electromagnetically-induced gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $1/r$ long-range interaction introduced by the laser beams offers a mechanism for the implementation of stable self-trapping in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the three-dimensional free space. Using the variational approximation and numerical solution, we find that self-trapped states in this setting closely resemble tightly-bound compactons. This feature of the self-trapped states is explained by an analytical solution for their asymptotic tails. Further, we demonstrate that stable vortex quasi-compactons (QCs), with topological charges up to $6$ (at least), exist in the same setting. Addressing two-body dynamics, we find that pairs of ground states, as well as vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex pairs, form stably rotating bound states. Head-on collisions between vortex QCs under small kicks are inelastic, resulting in their merger into a ground state soliton that may either remain at the collision position or move aside, or alternatively, lead to the formation of a vortex that also moves aside.</description>

      <title>Vortex phases and domain walls in trapped spinor Bose-Einsein condensates with inhomogeneous spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state structures and vortex configurations in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) under the influence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling (SOAMC) with a high spatial inhomogeneity and high characteristic orbital angular momentum. By modulating the coupling strength we uncover two distinct quantum phases: a stripe phase at low coupling strengths and a new vortex-necklace phase at higher coupling intensities. The latter is characterized by vortices forming a ring-shaped structure that acts as a domain wall, a unique phase boundary between a central stripe phase and an outer single-momentum phase. For a better understanding of this new mixed phase of the system, we develop an analytical model to describe the domain wall radius as a function of coupling strength, which aligns well with numerical simulations. Our findings contribute to the understanding of SOAMC-driven quantum phase transitions and domain wall formation, offering new insights into topological phenomena in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Reflections on dipolar quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic description of ultracold gases with dipolar interactions which properly accounts for the long-range nature and broken rotation invariance of the interactions. It involves an additional thermodynamic field conjugate to the linear extension of the gas along the direction of the dipoles. The associated uniaxial pressure shows up as a deviation from the Gibbs-Duhem relation in the density profile of a trapped gas. It has to vanish in self-bound droplets, a condition which determines the observed dependence of the aspect ratio on particle number. A tensorial generalization of the virial theorem and a number of further exact thermodynamic relations are derived. Finally, extending a model due to Nozi\`eres, a simple criterion for the freezing transition to a superfluid mass density wave is given.</description>

      <title>Associative ionization in a dilute ultracold $^7$Li gas probed with a hybrid trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of Li$_2^+$ and subsequently Li$^+$ ions, during the excitation of $^7$Li atoms to the $3S_{1/2}$ state in a $^7$Li magneto optical trap (MOT), is probed in an ion-atom hybrid trap. Associative ionization occurs during the collision of Li($2P_{3/2}$) and Li($3S_{1/2}$) ultracold atoms, creating Li$_2^+$ ions. Photodissociation of Li$_2^+$ by the MOT lasers is an active channel for the conversion of Li$_2^+$ to Li$^+$. A fraction of the Li$_2^+$ ions is long lived even in the presence of MOT light. Additionally, rapid formation of Li$^+$ from Li$_2^+$ in the absence of MOT light is observed. Resonant excitation of ultracold atoms, resulting in intricate molecular dynamics, reveals important processes in ultracold dilute gases.</description>

      <title>Towers of Quantum Many-body Scars from Integrable Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct several models with multiple quantum many-body scars (QMBS) using integrable boundary states~(IBS). We focus on the tilted N\'eel states, which are parametrized IBS of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, and show that these states can be used to construct a tower of scar states. Our models exhibit periodic revival dynamics, showcasing a characteristic behavior of superpositions of QMBS. Furthermore, the tower of QMBS found in this study possesses a restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA) structure, indicating that QMBS are equally spaced in energy. This approach can be extended to two-dimensional models, which can be decomposed into an array of one-dimensional models. In this case, the tilted N\'eel states again serve as parent states for multiple scar states. These states demonstrate low entanglement entropy, marking them as exact scar states. Notably, their entanglement entropy adheres to the sub-volume law, further solidifying the nonthermal properties of QMBS. Our results provide novel insights into constructing QMBS using IBS, thereby illuminating the connection between QMBS and integrable models.</description>

      <title>Cancellation theorem breaking and resonant spin-tensor Hall conductivity in higher-rank spin-tensor Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With recent advances in simulating quantum phenomena in cold atoms, the higher-rank spin tensor Hall effect was discovered in larger spin systems with spin-tensor-momentum coupling, which is an extension of the celebrated spin Hall effects in larger spins. Previously, it has been proposed that a 2D electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling can generate dissipationless transverse spin current, namely the spin Hall effect. However, later work showed that the spin current is canceled by vertex correction, which was subsequently proven by a cancellation theorem that does not depend on any assumptions related to the scattering mechanism, the strength of spin-orbit coupling, or the Fermi energy. While the recent proposal demonstrates a universal intrinsic spin-tensor Hall conductivity, it is unclear if it vanishes similarly to the spin Hall effect. In this work, we address this critical problem and show that the rank-2 spin-tensor current can be divergent by considering the contributions of both interbranch and intrabranch transitions, which resembles the quantum Hall effect in some sense. So the \textit{universal} spin-tensor Hall effect can not be observed in a system with finite size. However, we further show that there is an \textit{observable non-zero} resonance of spin-tensor Hall conductivity as the Landau levels cross under the magnetic field. Our work reveals interesting conductivity properties of larger-spin systems and will provide valuable guidance for experimental explorations of higher-rank spin-tensor Hall effects, as well as their potential device applications.</description>

      <title>Uncovering thermodynamic origin of counterflow and coflow instabilities in miscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore instabilities in binary superfluids with a nonvanishing relative superflow, particularly focusing on counterflow and coflow instabilities. We extend recent results on the thermodynamic origin of finite superflow instabilities in single-component superfluids to binary systems and derive a criterion for the onset of instability through a hydrodynamic analysis. To verify this result, we utilize both the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and a holographic binary superfluid model, which naturally incorporates strong coupling, finite temperature, and dissipation. We find that the counterflow and coflow instabilities in binary superfluids are all essentially thermodynamic. Except the one due to order competing via global thermodynamic instability, the others are caused by an eigenvalue of the free energy Hessian diverging and changing sign. We also observe that the critical velocities of these instabilities follow a general scaling law related to the interaction strength between superfluid components. The nonlinear stages of the instabilities are also studied by full time evolution, where vortex dynamics is found to play a significant role, resulting in the reduction of superfluid velocity back to a stable phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and generalized area law in fully connected models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law in interacting bosons: from Bose-Hubbard, $\phi$4, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement area law is a universal principle that characterizes the information structure in quantum many-body systems and serves as the foundation for modern algorithms based on tensor network representations. Historically, the area law has been well understood under two critical assumptions: short-range interactions and bounded local energy. However, extending the area law beyond these assumptions has been a long-sought goal in quantum many-body theory. This challenge is especially pronounced in interacting boson systems, where the breakdown of the bounded energy assumption is universal and poses significant difficulties. In this work, we prove the area law for one-dimensional interacting boson systems including the long-range interactions. Our model encompasses the Bose-Hubbard class and the $\phi4$ class, two of the most fundamental models in quantum condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. This result achieves the resolution of the area law that incorporates both the challenges of unbounded local energy and long-range interactions in a unified manner. Additionally, we establish an efficiency-guaranteed approximation of the quantum ground states using Matrix Product States (MPS). These results significantly advance our understanding of quantum complexity by offering new insights into how bosonic parameters and interaction decay rates influence entanglement. Our findings provide crucial theoretical foundations for simulating long-range interacting cold atomic systems, which are central to modern quantum technologies, and pave the way for more efficient simulation techniques in future quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Adiabatons in a double tripod coherent atom-light coupling scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical adiabatons are specific shape-invariant pulse pairs propagating at the reduced group velocity and without optical absorption in the medium. The purpose of this study is to analyze and demonstrate adiabaton formation in many level atomic systems. Here we focus on the analysis of five level M-type and double tripod systems. It is found that M-type atomic systems are prone to intensity dependent group velocity and pulse front steepening which prevents the formation of long range optical adiabatons. In contrast, the double tripod atomic system is quite favorable for the formation of optical adiabatons leading to two different optical field configurations propagating with invariant shape.</description>
