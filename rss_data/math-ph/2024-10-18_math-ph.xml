      <title>Resonances and resonance expansions for point interactions on the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the resonances of the singular perturbation of the Laplacian on the half space $\Omega =\mathbb R^3_+$ given by the self-adjoint operator named $\delta$-interaction or point interaction. We will assume Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on $\partial \Omega$. At variance with the well known case of $\mathbb R^3$, the resonances constitute an infinite set, here completely characterized. Moreover, we prove that resonances have an asymptotic distribution satisfying a modified Weyl law. Finally we give applications of the results to the asymptotic behavior of the abstract Wave and Schr\"odinger dynamics generated by the Laplacian with a point interaction on the half-space.</description>

      <title>Representation of Linear Waves in Inhomogeneous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article explores the acoustic equations in inhomogeneous media and the linearized shallow water equations.
  Two methods for integrating these equations are proposed. The first method is based on the of the Laplace cascade method, while the second involves reducing two-dimensional and three-dimensional models to the wave equation. In the case of plane waves, solutions to some equations depending on two arbitrary functions are obtained. In the two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, equations that can be reduced to equations with constant coefficients are found.</description>

      <title>Bumpified Haar Wavelets and Tsirelson's Bound: Some Mathematical Properties and Insights from Block Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a recent construction using bumpified Haar wavelets to demonstrate explicit violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality within the vacuum state in quantum field theory. The construction was tested for massless spinor fields in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and is claimed to achieve violations arbitrarily close to an upper bound known as Tsirelson's bound. We show that this claim can be reduced to a mathematical conjecture involving the maximal eigenvalue of a sequence of symmetric matrices composed of integrals of Haar wavelet products. More precisely, the asymptotic eigenvalue of this sequence should approach $\pi$. We present a formal argument using a subclass of wavelets, allowing us to reach $3.11052$. Although a complete proof remains elusive, we present further compelling numerical evidence to support it.</description>

      <title>Generating function for quantum depletion of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Bose gas on the unit torus at zero temperature in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, known to perform Bose-Einstein condensation: a macroscopic fraction of the bosons occupy the same quantum state, called condensate. We study the Bose gas' quantum depletion, that is the number of bosons outside the condensate, and derive an explicit asymptotic formula of its generating function. Moreover, we prove an upper bound for large deviations of the quantum depletion.</description>

Abstract: We prove that normalized colored Alexander polynomial (the $A \rightarrow 1$ limit of colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial) evaluated for one-hook (L-shape) representation R possesses scaling property: it is equal to the fundamental Alexander polynomial with the substitution $q \rightarrow q^{|R|}$. The proof is simple and direct use of Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism to get all required R-matrices.</description>

      <title>An algebraic study of parametric Stokes phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate geometric aspects of co-equational parametric resurgence, by studying physical problems whose formal asymptotic solutions give rise to Borel transforms lying on an algebraic curve. This perspective allows us to elucidate concepts unique to parametric resurgence such as singularity structures, (virtual) turning points and the higher-order Stokes phenomenon. We construct examples as solutions to Borel plane partial differential equations using an algebraic curve ansatz before turning to the general analytic structure of co-equational resurgence problems, where we provide a systematic description of analytic continuation and Stokes constants through a Borel plane inner-outer matching procedure.</description>

      <title>Poincare field theory for massless particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main proposition is that field equations for all spins can be obtained from Casimir eigenvalue equations for Poincare group. We have already confirm that statement for massive scalar, spinor and vector fields in Ref.[1]. In the present article we are going to confirm this statement for massless vector, second and fourth rang tensor fields. In particular we will obtain Maxwell equations and Einstein equation in weak field approximation.
  As is well known, Wigner define a particles as irreducible representation of Poincare group [2,3]. But, as Weinberg noted in [4] irreducible representations for massless vector field with helicities $\pm 1$ do not exist. In the present article we will conform this statement for a wide class of massless fields. They are not Lorentz invariant since their Lorentz transformations have additional term in the form of gauge transformations. Such fields can appear in the theory only in the form which do not depend on corresponding gauge parameters. These forms are our equations of motion and they are by definition gauge invariant. So, the massless case is significantly different from massive one.</description>

      <title>Local Properties of the Rapidity Distribution in the Lieb-Liniger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rapidity distribution in the Lieb-Liniger model and derive exact relations for its derivatives at the Fermi level. The latter enables us to treat analytically the free energy of the system at low temperatures and arbitrary interactions. We calculated the leading-order correction to the well-known result obtained using conformal field theory. In contrast to the leading-order term controlled by the sound velocity or the Luttinger liquid parameter, the new term is controlled by an additional dimensionless parameter. We calculated its series expansions in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions. Our results are generalized to other Galilean-invariant integrable systems.</description>

      <title>The $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$ WZW model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some WZW models on affine Lie superalgebras at critical level describe string theory on AdS backgrounds at critical values of the string tension. This is the case of $\mathfrak{psu}(1,1|2)_1$ for ${\rm AdS}_3 \times {\rm S}^3$ and potentially of $\mathfrak{u}(2|2)_1$ (or related algebras) for ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^5$. Many interesting features of these superalgebra models are already captured by their affine subalgebra $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$. In this paper we study the WZW model on $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$: we classify the representations, introduce a free field realisation, and decompose the free field modules in terms of $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$. We find continuous and discrete modular invariants and see that the latter naturally leads to considering superalgebra extensions of $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$. Lastly, we find an invariant for the free field theory of four symplectic bosons.</description>

      <title>Massive bigravity as a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma model encoding the ghost free massive bigravity theory action as well as its Batalin-Vilkovisky extension in terms of the finite-dimensional graded geometry of the target space. A characteristic feature of the construction is that the target space is realised as a quasi-regular submanifold of a linear graded manifold which, in turn, is a direct product of two copies of the shifted Poincar\'e Lie algebra. This graded manifold comes equipped with a natural presymplectcic structure and the compatible pre-$Q$ structure which is a sum of the Chevalley-Eilenberg differentials of each copy of the Poincare algebra and the interaction term. The constraints determining the submanifold are the supergeometrical realization of the known Deser-Van Nieuwenhuizen condition and its descendant.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Stochastic Modeling and Regularity in Turbulent Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations by integrating Sobolev-Besov hybrid spaces with fractional operators and quantum-inspired dynamics. We propose new regularity theorems that address the multiscale and chaotic nature of fluid flows, offering novel insights into energy dissipation mechanisms. The introduction of a Schr\"odinger-like operator into the fluid dynamics model captures quantum-scale turbulence effects, enhancing our understanding of energy redistribution across different scales. The results also include the development of anisotropic stochastic models that account for direction-dependent viscosity, improving the representation of real-world turbulent flows. These advances in stochastic modeling and regularity analysis provide a comprehensive toolset for tackling complex fluid dynamics problems. The findings are applicable to fields such as engineering, quantum turbulence, and environmental sciences. Future directions include the numerical implementation of the proposed models and the use of machine learning techniques to optimize parameters for enhanced simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A unified fourth-order Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook lattice Boltzmann model for high-dimensional linear hyperbolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we first develop a unified Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook lattice Boltzmann (BGK-LB) model for the $d$($d\geq 1$)-dimensional linear hyperbolic equation (L-HE), where the natural moments and the D$d$Q$(2d^2+1)$ [($2d^2+1$) discrete velocities in $d$-dimensional space] lattice structure are considered. Subsequently, at the acoustic scaling, we conduct an accuracy analysis on the developed BGK-LB model by the direct Taylor expansion (DTE) method, and present the second- and third-order moments of the equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs) to ensure that the BGK-LB model can be fourth-order consistent with the L-HE. And on this basis, when considering the Dirichlet boundary condition, the fourth-order full-way and half-way boundary schemes are proposed to approximate the unknown distribution functions to ensure that the BGK-LB model can be overall fourth-order accurate. Thereafter, based on the kinetic entropy theory, we derive the conditions that the fourth-order moments of the EDFs should satisfy to ensure the microscopic entropy stability of the BGK-LB model. In addition, with the aid of the von Neumann stability analysis, we also discuss the $L^2$ stability of the BGK-LB model and numerically plot the stability regions. In particular, from a numerical perspective, we find that the region of microscopic entropy stability is identical to that of $L^2$ stability. Finally, we carry out some numerical experiments to test the accuracy and stability of the BGK-LB model, and the numerical results are in agreement with our theoretical analysis. In addition, we compare the developed full-way and half-way boundary schemes for the Dirichlet boundary condition, which shows that the full-way boundary scheme is more stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide an introduction to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, a fundamental concept in the theories of 2D quantum gravity, topological string theory, and matrix models. We begin by reviewing some basic results concerning the recursive boundary structure of the moduli space and the associated cohomology theory. We then present Witten's celebrated conjecture and its generalisation, framing it as a recursive computation of cohomological field theory correlators via topological recursion. We conclude with a discussion of JT gravity in relation to hyperbolic geometry and topological strings. These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)" in Summer 2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Truncating the Dyson-Schwinger (DS) equations in quantum field theory presents a practical challenge. In this paper, we consider the zero-dimensional prototype of the path integrals in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Using the Lefschetz thimble decomposition and the saddle point expansion, we derive multiple asymptotic formal series of the correlation function, which are associated with the (non-)perturbative saddle points. Furthermore, we reconstruct the exact correlation function employing the Borel resummation. Based on these exact correlation functions, we propose a truncation method of the DS equations using the large $n$ asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the support of semiclassical measures for higher-dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cat maps are toy models in quantum chaos associated to hyperbolic symplectic matrices $A\in \operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{Z})$. The macroscopic limits of sequences of eigenfunctions of a quantum cat map are characterized by semiclassical measures on the torus $\mathbb{R}^{2n}/\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. We show that if the characteristic polynomial of every power $A^k$ is irreducible over the rationals, then every semiclassical measure has full support. The proof uses an earlier strategy of Dyatlov-J\'ez\'equel [arXiv:2108.10463] and the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen [arXiv:2305.05022]. Our irreducibility condition is generically true, in fact we show that asymptotically for $100\%$ of matrices $A$, the Galois group of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $S_2 \wr S_n$.
  When the irreducibility condition does not hold, we show that a semiclassical measure cannot be supported on a finite union of parallel non-coisotropic subtori. On the other hand, we give examples of semiclassical measures supported on the union of two transversal symplectic subtori for $n=2$, inspired by the work of Faure-Nonnenmacher-De Bi\`evre [arXiv:nlin/0207060] in the case $n=1$. This is complementary to the examples by Kelmer [arXiv:math-ph/0510079] of semiclassical measures supported on a single coisotropic subtorus.</description>

Abstract: A new ``Percolation with Clustering'' (PWC) model is introduced, where (the probabilities of) site percolation configurations on the leaf set of a binary tree are rewarded exponentially according to a generic function, which measures the degree of clustering in the configuration. Conditions on such ``clustering function'' are given for the existence of a limiting free energy and a wetting transition, namely the existence of a non-trivial percolation parameter threshold above and only above which the set of ``dry'' (open) sites have an asymptotic density. Several examples of clustering functions are given and studied using the general theory. The results here will be used in a sequel paper to study the wetting transition for the discrete Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall constraint.</description>

      <title>Third moments of qudit Clifford orbits and 3-designs based on magic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the local dimension $d$ is an odd prime, the qudit Clifford group is only a 2-design, but not a 3-design, unlike the qubit counterpart. This distinction and its extension to Clifford orbits have profound implications for many applications in quantum information processing. In this work we systematically delve into general qudit Clifford orbits with a focus on the third moments and potential applications in shadow estimation. First, we introduce the shadow norm to quantify the deviations of Clifford orbits from 3-designs and clarify its properties. Then, we show that the third normalized frame potential and shadow norm are both $\mathcal{O}(d)$ for any Clifford orbit, including the orbit of stabilizer states, although the operator norm of the third normalized moment operator may increase exponentially with the number $n$ of qudits when $d\neq 2\mod 3$. Moreover, we prove that the shadow norm of any magic orbit is upper bounded by the constant $15/2$, so a single magic gate can already eliminate the $\mathcal{O}(d)$ overhead in qudit shadow estimation and bridge the gap between qudit systems and qubit systems. Furthermore, we propose simple recipes for constructing approximate and exact 3-designs (with respect to three figures of merit simultaneously) from one or a few Clifford orbits. Notably, accurate approximate 3-designs can be constructed from only two Clifford orbits. For an infinite family of local dimensions, exact 3-designs can be constructed from two or four Clifford orbits. In the course of study, we clarify the key properties of the commutant of the third Clifford tensor power and the underlying mathematical structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher Time Derivative Theories are generated by considering space-time rotated KdV and mKdV systems. These systems are then studied to see if/how instabilities, usually associated with higher time derivative theories, manifest on the classical level by presenting both analytic and numerical solutions. For a linearised version of these space-time rotated systems we present a detailed quantisation of the theory that highlights the known dilemma on higher time derivative theories, that we have either negative norm states or the Hamiltonian being unbounded from below.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of topological localised interface modes to systems with damping. The spectral problem is formulated as a root-finding problem for the interface impedance function and Rouch\'e's theorem is used to track the zeros when damping is introduced. We show that the localised eigenfrequencies, corresponding to interface modes, remain for non-zero dampings. Using the transfer matrix method, we explicitly characterise the decay rate of the interface mode.</description>

      <title>A new framework for particle-wave interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In plasma physics, collisionless charged particles are transported following the dynamics of a meanfield Vlasov equation with a self-consistent electric field generated by the charge density. Due to the long range interaction between particles, the generating electric field oscillates and disperses like a Klein-Gordon dispersive wave, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or Langmuir's oscillatory waves. The oscillatory electric field in turn drives particles. Despite its great physical importance, the question of whether such a nonlinear particle-wave interaction would remain regular globally and be damped in the large time has been an outstanding open problem. In this paper, we propose a new framework to resolve this exact nonlinear interaction. Specifically, we employ the framework to establish the large time behavior and scattering of solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov-Klein-Gordon system in the small initial data regime. The novelty of this work is to provide a detailed physical space description of particles moving in an oscillatory field and to resolve oscillations for the electric field generated by the collective interacting particles. This appears to be the first such a result analyzing oscillations in the physical phase space $\mathbb{R}^3_x\times \mathbb{R}_v^3$.</description>

Abstract: We point out that the construction of a martingale observable describing the spin interface of the two-dimensional Ising model extends to a class of non-integrable variants of the two-dimensional Ising model, and express it in terms of Grassmann integrals. Under a conjecture about the scaling limit of this object, which is similar to some results recently obtained using constructive renormalization group methods, this would imply that the distribution of the interface at criticality has the same scaling limit as in the integrable model: Schramm-Loewner evolution SLE(3).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the development of a spectral triple-like construction on a configuration space of gauge connections. We have previously shown that key elements of bosonic and fermionic quantum field theory emerge from such a geometrical framework. In this paper we solve a central problem concerning the inclusion of fermions with half-integer spin into this framework. We map the tangent space of the configuration space into a similar space based on spinors and use this map to construct a Dirac operator on the configuration space. We also construct a real structure acting in a Hilbert space over the configuration space. Finally, we show that the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of the Hamiltonian of a non-perturbative quantum Yang-Mills theory emerge from a unitary transformation of a Dirac equation on a configuration space of gauge fields. The dual and anti-dual sectors emerge in a two-by-two matrix structure.</description>

Abstract: We study the spin Gromov-Witten (GW) theory of $\mathbb{P}^1$. Using the standard torus action on $\mathbb{P}^1$, we prove that the associated equivariant potential can be expressed by means of operator formalism and satisfies the 2-BKP hierarchy. As a consequence of this result, we prove the spin analogue of the GW/Hurwitz correspondence of Okounkov-Pandharipande for $\mathbb{P}^1$, which was conjectured by J. Lee. Finally, we prove that this correspondence for a general target spin curve follows from a conjectural degeneration formula for spin GW invariants that holds in virtual dimension 0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Smith embedding of a finite planar map with two marked vertices, possibly with conductances on the edges, is a way of representing the map as a tiling of a finite cylinder by rectangles. In this embedding, each edge of the planar map corresponds to a rectangle, and each vertex corresponds to a horizontal segment. Given a sequence of finite planar maps embedded in an infinite cylinder, such that the random walk on both the map and its planar dual converges to Brownian motion modulo time change, we prove that the a priori embedding is close to an affine transformation of the Smith embedding at large scales. By applying this result, we prove that the Smith embeddings of mated-CRT maps with the sphere topology converge to $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity ($\gamma$-LQG).</description>

We parameterize the eigenvalues of both the transfer matrix and the corresponding fused transfer matrix by their zero points instead of Bethe roots. Based on the patterns of the zero points distribution and the reconstructed entropy, we obtain the nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) describing the thermodynamics of the model and compute its free energy at a finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Postselection technique for optical Quantum Key Distribution with improved de Finetti reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.</description>

      <title>Self-resonance during preheating: The case of $\alpha$-attractor models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, for the first time, we obtain a new class of solutions for the Hill-type differential equations, which emerge in the preheating self-resonance phase of the expanding Universe. We study, in particular, the class of symmetric and asymmetric scalar field potentials coming from the so-called $\alpha$-attractor models of the early Universe cosmology. By making a series expansion of the potential and employing perturbative techniques we reformulate the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation, which captures the dynamics of the curvature perturbation in these models, into a Hill equation. This last includes higher-order terms that were never solved in the literature. Namely, those coming from the cubic and quartic contributions of the scalar field potential. Then, we derive the expressions for the Floquet exponents of the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable. Our analytical results are then compared with numerical computations, showing a good agreement and thus making this method valuable for obtaining theoretical predictions with new observational applications in the contexts of Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. Examples of additivity, while rare, provide key insight into the origins of nonadditivity and enable our best upper bounds on capacities. Degradable channels, which have additive coherent information, are some of the only channels for which we can calculate the quantum capacity. In this paper we construct non-degradable quantum channels that nevertheless have additive coherent information and therefore easily calculated quantum capacity. The first class of examples is constructed by generalizing the Platypus channel, as introduced by Leditzky et al., which demonstrates interesting properties of additivity and non-additivity. The second class of examples, whose additivity follows from a conjectured reverse-type data processing inequality, is based on probabilistic mixture of degradable and anti-degradable channels. As a byproduct, we provide some possible examples of quantum channels with zero quantum capacity, which are neither anti-degradable nor PPT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a connection between Dirac operators on configuration spaces and Yang-Mills quantum field theory. We first show that the Hamilton operators of the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory emerge from unitary transformations of a Dirac equation formulated on a configuration space of gauge connections. Secondly, we formulate a Bott-Dirac operator on the configuration space and demonstrate how the Hamilton operator of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector emerges from its square. Finally, we discuss a spectral invariant that emerges in this framework.</description>

Abstract: We study the fluctuations of discretized versions of the stochastic heat equation (SHE) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in spatial dimensions $d&gt;2$ in the weak disorder regime. The discretization is defined using the directed polymer model. Previous research has identified the scaling limit of both equations under a suboptimal moment condition and, in particular, it was established that both converge to the same limit in law. We extend this result by showing that the fluctuations of both equations are close in probability in the subcritical weak disorder regime, indicating that they share the same scaling limit (the existence of which remains open). Our result applies under a moment condition that is expected to be valid throughout the interior of the weak disorder phase, which is currently only known under a technical assumption on the environment. We also prove a lower tail concentration of the partition functions.</description>

      <title>Unitarity and strong graded locality of holomorphic vertex operator superalgebras with central charge at most 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that all nice holomorphic vertex operator superalgebras (VOSAs) with central charge at most 24 and with non-trivial odd part are unitary, apart from the hypothetical ones arising as fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA or of the latter tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA. Furthermore, excluding the ones with central charge 24 of glueing type III and with no real free fermion, we show that they are all strongly graded-local. In particular, they naturally give rise to holomorphic graded-local conformal nets. In total, we are able to prove that 910 of the 969 nice holomorphic VOSAs with central charge 24 and with non-trivial odd part are strongly graded-local, without counting hypothetical fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA.</description>

      <title>On two systems of Burgers type arising in nonlinear wave interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we study the well-posedness of two systems of Burgers type arising in nonlinear wave interactions. The first model describes the interaction of a Burger's bore with the classical Korteweg-de Vries equation while the second exemplify the interaction of weak sound waves and entropy waves with small amplitudes. For the former, we show the local existence and uniqueness of solutions in Sobolev spaces and Wiener-type spaces. For the latter, we provide an elementary proof of finite time singularity.</description>
