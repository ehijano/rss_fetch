      <title>Invariant splitting principles for the Lipshitz--Ozsv\'ath--Thurston correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Lipshitz-Ozsv\'ath-Thurston correspondence between extended type D structures of knot complements and $\mathbb{F}[U, V]/(UV)$ knot Floer complexes can be arranged so that $\iota_K$-invariant splittings of knot Floer chain complexes correspond to $\iota_{S^3 \setminus K}$-invariant splittings of bordered Floer homology of knot complements. For patterns satisfying the satellite extension property, which include cabling patterns, this provides a novel way to compute the involutive knot Floer homology of satellites from that of their companions. As a topological application, we show that our results can be applied to construct infinitely many examples of exotic pairs of contractible 4-manifolds which remain exotic after one stabilization. Along the way, we also establish first order naturality of bordered Floer homology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Reeb graphs on two- and three-connected planar polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the topological structure of planar polygon decomposition on trapezoids, which is formed by height functions. We use the oriented Reeb graph of the function with a marked vertex. We describe all possible optimal Reeb graphs in the case of polygon in general position with one local minimum and one local maximum. By optimal Reeb graph we mean Reeb graph, which cann't be obtaned from other Reeb graph by subdivision of an edge or a leaf attaching. In this case polygon is a triangle with triangle holes. Constructed Reeb graphs give topological structures of trapezoid maps on two-connected polygon with six vertexes and three-connected polygon with nine vertexes.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition and Siegel-Veech transforms for strata: The case of marked tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the well-known construction of Eisenstein series on the modular curves, Siegel-Veech transforms provide a natural construction of square-integrable functions on strata of differentials on Riemannian surfaces. This space carries actions of the foliated Laplacian derived from the SL(2,R)-action as well as various differential operators related to relative period translations.
  In the paper we give spectral decompositions for the stratum of tori with two marked points. This is a homogeneous space for a special affine group, which is not reductive and thus does not fall into well-studied cases of the Langlands program, but still allows to employ techniques from representation theory and global analysis. Even for this simple stratum exhibiting all Siegel-Veech transforms requires novel configurations of saddle connections. We also show that the contiunuous spectrum of the foliated Laplacian is much larger than the space of Siegel-Veech transforms, as opposed to the case of the modular curve. This defect can be remedied by using instead a compound Laplacian involving relative period translations.</description>

      <title>Signed clasp numbers and four-genus bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist knots having positive and negative four-dimensional clasp numbers zero but having four-genus, and hence clasp number, arbitrarily large. Such examples were first constructed by Allison Miller, answering a question of Juhasz-Zemke. Further examples are constructed here, complementing those of Miller in that they include examples that are of infinite order in concordance.</description>

      <title>Horizontal decompositions, II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete the classification of the smooth, closed, oriented 4-manifolds having Euler characteristic less than four and a horizontal handlebody decomposition of genus one. We use the classification result to find a large family of rational homology ball smoothings of cyclic quotient singularities which can be smoothly embedded into the complex projective plane. Our family contains all such rational balls previously known to embed into $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and infinitely many more. We also show that a rational ball of our family admits an almost-complex embedding in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ if and only if it admits a symplectic embedding.</description>

      <title>Tight contact structures on some families of small Seifert fiber spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $K$ is a knot in a 3-manifold $Y$, and that $Y$ admits a pair of distinct contact structures. Assume that $K$ has Legendrian representatives in each of these contact structures, such that the corresponding Thurston-Bennequin framings are equivalent. This paper provides a method to prove that the contact structures resulting from Legendrian surgery along these two representatives remain distinct. Applying this method to the situation where the starting manifold is $-\Sigma(2,3,6m+1)$ and the knot is a singular fiber, together with convex surface theory we can classify the tight contact structures on certain families of Seifert fiber spaces.</description>

      <title>On Z-compactifiability of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1976, Chapman and Siebenmann \cite{CS76} established necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{Z}$-compactifying Hilbert cube manifolds. While these conditions are known to be necessary for a manifold $M^n$ to admit a $\mathcal{Z}$-compactification, it remains an open question whether these conditions are also sufficient. Guilbault and the author \cite[Thm. 1.2]{GG20} proved that these conditions are sufficient for the product $M^n \times [-2,2]$ $(n\geq 5)$ to be $\mathcal{Z}$-compactifiable. We further explore this topic by introducing additional conditions such that a $\mathcal{Z}$-compactification of $M^n \times [-2,2]$ indeed implies a $\mathcal{Z}$-compactification of $M^n$, thus partially resolving the open question. As applications, it is shown that there exist infinitely many non-pseudo-collarable 4-manifolds which are $\mathcal{Z}$-compactifiable; however, pseudo-collarable manifolds with compact boundary of dimension at least six are $\mathcal{Z}$-compactifiable.
  Furthermore, we investigate the connection between $\mathcal{Z}$-compactifiability with the topological rigidity of aspherical manifolds. We also construct a noncompact one-sided $s$-cobordism $(W,V,V^{\ast})$ satisfying controlled Mather-Thurston theorems, where $V$ is $\mathcal{Z}$-compactifiable, whereas $V^{\ast}$ may not be.</description>

      <title>On the Betti Numbers of Finite Volume Hyperbolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.11431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain strong upper bounds for the Betti numbers of compact complex-hyperbolic manifolds. We use the unitary holonomy to improve the results given by the most direct application of the techniques of [DS17]. We also provide effective upper bounds for Betti numbers of compact quaternionic- and Cayley-hyperbolic manifolds in most degrees. More importantly, we extend our techniques to complete finite volume real- and complex-hyperbolic manifolds. In this setting, we develop new monotonicity inequalities for strongly harmonic forms on hyperbolic cusps and employ a new peaking argument to estimate $L^2$-cohomology ranks. Finally, we provide bounds on the de Rham cohomology of such spaces, using a combination of our bounds on $L^2$-cohomology, bounds on the number of cusps in terms of the volume, and the topological interpretation of reduced $L^2$-cohomology on certain rank one locally symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the homology of periodic cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A periodic cell complex, $K$, has a finite representation as the quotient space, $q(K)$, consisting of equivalence classes of cells identified under the translation group acting on $K$. We study how the Betti numbers and cycles of $K$ are related to those of $q(K)$, first for the case that $K$ is a graph, and then higher-dimensional cell complexes. When $K$ is a $d$-periodic graph, it is possible to define $\mathbb{Z}^d$-weights on the edges of the quotient graph and this information permits full recovery of homology generators for $K$. The situation for higher-dimensional cell complexes is more subtle and studied in detail using the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence.</description>
