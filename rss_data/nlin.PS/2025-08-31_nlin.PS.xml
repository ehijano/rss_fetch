      <title>Pattern formation and nonlinear waves close to a 1:1 resonant Turing and Turing--Hopf instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the dynamics of a pattern-forming system close to simultaneous Turing and Turing--Hopf instabilities, which have a 1:1 spatial resonance, that is, they have the same critical wave number. For this, we consider a system of coupled Swift--Hohenberg equations with dispersive terms and general, smooth nonlinearities. Close to the onset of instability, we derive a system of two coupled complex Ginzburg--Landau equations with a singular advection term as amplitude equations and justify the approximation by providing error estimates. We then construct space-time periodic solutions to the amplitude equations, as well as fast-travelling front solutions, which connect different space-time periodic states. This yields the existence of solutions to the pattern-forming system on a finite, but long time interval, which model the spatial transition between different patterns. The construction is based on geometric singular perturbation theory exploiting the fast travelling speed of the fronts. Finally, we construct global, spatially periodic solutions to the pattern-forming system by using centre manifold reduction, normal form theory and a variant of singular perturbation theory to handle fast oscillatory higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>Observation of nonlinear topological corner states originating from different spectral charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are unique topological materials supporting edge states with the dimensionality at least by two lower than the dimensionality of the underlying structure. HOTIs were observed on lattices with different symmetries, but only in geometries, where truncation of HOTI produces a finite structure with the same order of discrete rotational symmetry as that of the unit cell, thereby setting the geometry of insulator edge. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new type of two-dimensional (2D) HOTI based on the Kekule-patterned lattice, whose order of discrete rotational symmetry differs from that of the unit cells of the constituent honeycomb lattice, with hybrid boundaries that help to produce all three possible corners that support effectively 0D corner states of topological origin, especially the one associated with spectral charge 5/6. We also show that linear corner states give rise to rich families of stable hybrid nonlinear corner states bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity of the material. Such new types of nonlinear corner states are observed in hybrid HOTI inscribed in transparent nonlinear dielectric using fs-laser writing technique. Our results complete the class of HOTIs and open the way to observation of topological states with new internal structure and symmetry.</description>

      <title>Magnetic soliton molecules in binary condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-component Bose-Einstein condensates in the miscible phase can support polarization solitary waves, known as magnetic solitons. By calculating the interaction potential between two magnetic solitons, we elucidate the mechanisms and conditions for the formation of bound states -- or molecules -- and support these predictions with dynamical simulations. We analytically determine the dissociation energy of bound states consisting of two oppositely polarized solitons and find good agreement with full numerical simulations. Collisions between bound states -- either with other bound states or with individual solitons -- produce intriguing dynamics. Notably, collisions between a pair of bound states exhibit a dipole-like behavior. We anticipate that such bound states, along with their rich collision dynamics, are within reach of current experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Stabilization and Destabilization of Multimode Solitons in Nonlinear Degenerate Multi-Pass Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical solitons in multimode nonlinear optical systems offer a unique platform for exploring the interplay of nonlinearity, dispersion, and spatial mode coupling, offering insights into complex nonlinear wave phenomena. Multi-pass cavities (MPCs) incorporating nonlinear Kerr media serve as prototypical systems, enabling high-efficiency supercontinuum generation and pulse compression. However, stabilizing femtosecond laser pulses in solid-medium-based MPCs (solid MPCs) under strong Kerr nonlinearity remains a significant challenge due to multimode coupling, which disrupts beam stability. In this work, we address this challenge by investigating the stability of laser pulses in MPCs using Floquet and perturbation model. We identify novel mode-coupling-suppression (MCS) medium lengths, where destructive interference among multimode wave components suppresses coupling and facilitates soliton stabilization. Under MCS conditions, our simulations demonstrate stable beam propagation in solid MPCs with nonlinear phases up to 1.5{\pi} per pass, achieving &gt;13-fold pulse compression with excellent spatio-spectral homogeneity. Our findings offer valuable guidance for designing advanced MPCs with tailored Kerr media.</description>
