      <title>A Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Sea Surface Temperature in the Great Barrier Reef Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region is crucial for the effective management of its fragile ecosystems. This study provides a rigorous comparative analysis of several machine learning techniques to identify the most effective method for SST prediction in this area. We evaluate the performance of ridge regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. Our results reveal that while LASSO and ridge regression perform well, Random Forest and XGBoost significantly outperform them in terms of predictive accuracy, as evidenced by lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Prediction Error (RMSPE). Additionally, XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in minimizing Kullback- Leibler Divergence (KLD), indicating a closer alignment of predicted probability distributions with actual observations. These findings highlight the efficacy of using ensemble methods, particularly XGBoost, for predicting sea surface temperatures, making them valuable tools for climatological and environmental modeling.</description>

      <title>Developing Global Aerosol Models based on the Analysis of 30-Year Ground Measurements by AERONET (AEROEX models) and Implication on Satellite based Aerosol Retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET), established in 1993 with limited global sites, has grown to over 900 locations, providing three decades of continuous aerosol data. While earlier studies based on shorter time periods (10-12 years) and fewer sites (approximately 250) made significant contributions to aerosol research, the vast AERONET dataset (1993-2023) calls for a comprehensive reevaluation to refine global aerosol models and improve satellite retrievals. This is particularly important in light of major environmental changes such as industrialization, land use shifts, and natural events like wildfires and dust storms. In this study, a set of fine and coarse aerosol models called AERONET-Extended (AEROEX) models are developed based on cluster analysis of 30-years AERONET data, analyzing over 202,000 samples using Gaussian Mixture Models to classify aerosol types by season and region. Aerosols are categorized into spherical, spheroidal, and mixed types using particle linear depolarization ratio and fine mode fraction. Four fine-mode aerosol models were derived based on differences in scattering and absorption properties, revealing regional/seasonal variations, particularly in North America, Europe and Asia. Additionally, two coarse-mode aerosol models were identified, separated by their absorbing properties in dust-prone and polluted regions. We performed simulation analysis showing that the new models significantly improve satellite-based aerosol optical depth retrievals compared to widely used dark target aerosol models. A global aerosol model map, generated at 1x1 degree resolution for each season using Random Forest and expert refinement, provides valuable insights for climate and atmospheric studies, improving satellite-based aerosol retrievals at global scale.</description>

      <title>Global spatio-temporal downscaling of ERA5 precipitation through generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation has a significant impact on human lives by determining freshwater resources and agricultural yield, but also rainfall-driven hazards like flooding or landslides. While the ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides consistent long-term global precipitation information that allows investigations of these impacts, it lacks the resolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. ERA5 misses intense local rainfall events that are crucial drivers of devastating flooding - a critical limitation since extreme weather events become increasingly frequent. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep learning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale. SpateGAN-ERA5 uses a conditional generative adversarial neural network (cGAN) that enhances the resolution of ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1 hour to 2 km and 10 minutes, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with realistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution including extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to the challenges of downscaling. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in the US and Australia considering diverse climate zones, spateGAN-ERA5 demonstrates strong generalization indicating a robust global applicability. SpateGAN-ERA5 fulfils a critical need for high-resolution precipitation data in hydrological and meteorological research, offering new capabilities for flood risk assessment, AI-enhanced weather forecasting, and impact modelling to address climate-driven challenges worldwide.</description>

      <title>Path to Low-Cost Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now accepted that gigatonnes of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) from the atmosphere are needed to avoid the threat of catastrophic climate change. Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a promising scalable CDR with a relatively small environmental footprint. But questions about DAC cost and energy use remain that are delaying the needed DAC policy decisions to create a mobilization effort like was done in the Manhattan Project and to address the Covid crisis. Global Thermostat (GT) has publicly claimed costs of under 50 dollars per tonne for mature GT technology deployed at a climate relevant scale. Why this low DAC cost is achievable will be addressed by a simplified analysis of generic DAC costs and using that analysis combined with experimental data to evaluate GT's DAC technology. A detailed cost analysis of different approaches to DAC by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found an approach to DAC that had a learning cost limit as low as 25 dollars per tonne GT's DAC technology will be shown in Appendix 1 to have the same performance characteristics of the lowest-cost DAC identified in the NAS study. Thus, like solar costs, DAC costs can be reduced by learning by doing, but in the case of DAC, only one order of magnitude in cost reduction is needed. Therefore DAC technology can reach its low learning by doing cost limit at a scale much smaller than necessary to address climate change. From a climate perspective, current DAC embodiments costs and scale have less relevance than their learning curve cost limit. While GT's technology has demonstrated the crucial performance parameters to achieve a low-cost DAC, no inference should be drawn that other approaches cannot achieve low or lower cost, if they can demonstrate the crucial performance parameters. Continued R&amp;D on those performance parameters is needed.</description>

      <title>Detection of Sulfur Dioxide by Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (BBCEAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulfur dioxide ($\mathrm{SO}_2$) is an important precursor for the formation of atmospheric sulfate aerosol and acid rain. We present an instrument using Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (BBCEAS) for the measurement of $\mathrm{SO}_2$ with a minimum limit of detection of 0.75 ppbv (3-$\sigma$) using the spectral range 305.5--312 nm and an averaging time of 5 min. The instrument consists of high-reflectivity mirrors (0.9985 at 310 nm) and a deep UV light source (Light Emitting Diode). The effective absorption path length of the instrument is 610 m with a 0.966 m base length. Published reference absorption cross sections were used to fit and retrieve the $\mathrm{SO}_2$ concentrations and were compared to fluorescence standard measurements for $\mathrm{SO}_2$. The comparison was well correlated ($R^2 = 0.9998$) with a correlation slope of 1.04. Interferences for fluorescence measurements were tested, and the BBCEAS showed no interference, while ambient measurements responded similarly to standard measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic framework for learning non-intrusive corrections to long-time climate simulations from short-time training data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems, such as turbulent flows, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. However, their study remains a challenge due to the large range scales, and the strong interaction with other, often not fully understood, physics. As a consequence, the spatiotemporal resolution required for accurate simulation of these systems is typically computationally infeasible, particularly for applications of long-term risk assessment, such as the quantification of extreme weather risk due to climate change. While data-driven modeling offers some promise of alleviating these obstacles, the scarcity of high-quality simulations results in limited available data to train such models, which is often compounded by the lack of stability for long-horizon simulations. As such, the computational, algorithmic, and data restrictions generally imply that the probability of rare extreme events is not accurately captured. In this work we present a general strategy for training neural network models to non-intrusively correct under-resolved long-time simulations of chaotic systems. The approach is based on training a post-processing correction operator on under-resolved simulations nudged towards a high-fidelity reference. This enables us to learn the dynamics of the underlying system directly, which allows us to use very little training data, even when the statistics thereof are far from converged. Additionally, through the use of probabilistic network architectures we are able to leverage the uncertainty due to the limited training data to further improve extrapolation capabilities. We apply our framework to severely under-resolved simulations of quasi-geostrophic flow and demonstrate its ability to accurately predict the anisotropic statistics over time horizons more than 30 times longer than the data seen in training.</description>
