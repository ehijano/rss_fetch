      <title>Containment Control Approach for Steering Opinion in a Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the problem of steering multi-dimensional opinion in a social network. Assuming the society of desire consists of stubborn and regular agents, stubborn agents are considered as leaders who specify the desired opinion distribution as a distributed reward or utility function. In this context, each regular agent is seen as a follower, updating its bias on the initial opinion and influence weights by averaging their observations of the rewards their influencers have received. Assuming random graphs with reducible and irreducible topology specify the influences on regular agents, opinion evolution is represented as a containment control problem in which stability and convergence to the final opinion are proven.</description>

      <title>DualGuard MPPI: Safe and Performant Optimal Control by Combining Sampling-Based MPC and Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing controllers that are both safe and performant is inherently challenging. This co-optimization can be formulated as a constrained optimal control problem, where the cost function represents the performance criterion and safety is specified as a constraint. While sampling-based methods, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have shown great promise in tackling complex optimal control problems, they often struggle to enforce safety constraints. To address this limitation, we propose DualGuard-MPPI, a novel framework for solving safety-constrained optimal control problems. Our approach integrates Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis within the MPPI sampling process to ensure that all generated samples are provably safe for the system. On the one hand, this integration allows DualGuard-MPPI to enforce strict safety constraints; at the same time, it facilitates a more effective exploration of the environment with the same number of samples, reducing the effective sampling variance and leading to better performance optimization. Through several simulations and hardware experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves much higher performance compared to existing MPPI methods, without compromising safety.</description>

      <title>Sequential Multi-objective Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Predictive Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing predictive maintenance (PdM) methods typically focus solely on whether to replace system components without considering the costs incurred by inspection. However, a well-considered approach should be able to minimize Remaining Useful Life (RUL) at engine replacement while maximizing inspection interval. To achieve this, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be introduced. However, due to the sequential and mutually constraining nature of these 2 objectives, conventional MARL is not applicable. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel framework and develops a Sequential Multi-objective Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (SMOMA-PPO) algorithm. Furthermore, to provide comprehensive and effective degradation information to RL agents, we also employed Gated Recurrent Unit, quantile regression, and probability distribution fitting to develop a GRU-based RUL Prediction (GRP) model. Experiments demonstrate that the GRP method significantly improves the accuracy of RUL predictions in the later stages of system operation compared to existing methods. When incorporating its output into SMOMA-PPO, we achieve at least a 15% reduction in average RUL without unscheduled replacements (UR), nearly a 10% increase in inspection interval, and an overall decrease in maintenance costs. Importantly, our approach offers a new perspective for addressing multi-objective maintenance planning with sequential constraints, effectively enhancing system reliability and reducing maintenance expenses.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning: Survey and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fields of MPC and RL consider two successful control techniques for Markov decision processes. Both approaches are derived from similar fundamental principles, and both are widely used in practical applications, including robotics, process control, energy systems, and autonomous driving. Despite their similarities, MPC and RL follow distinct paradigms that emerged from diverse communities and different requirements. Various technical discrepancies, particularly the role of an environment model as part of the algorithm, lead to methodologies with nearly complementary advantages. Due to their orthogonal benefits, research interest in combination methods has recently increased significantly, leading to a large and growing set of complex ideas leveraging MPC and RL. This work illuminates the differences, similarities, and fundamentals that allow for different combination algorithms and categorizes existing work accordingly. Particularly, we focus on the versatile actor-critic RL approach as a basis for our categorization and examine how the online optimization approach of MPC can be used to improve the overall closed-loop performance of a policy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resource Allocation Optimization Using Large Language Models in Dynamic Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has made notable progress in addressing complex radio access network control challenges that conventional analytic methods have struggled to solve. However, DL has shown limitations in solving constrained NP-hard problems often encountered in network optimization, such as those involving quality of service (QoS) or discrete variables like user indices. Current solutions rely on domain-specific architectures or heuristic techniques, and a general DL approach for constrained optimization remains undeveloped. Moreover, even minor changes in communication objectives demand time-consuming retraining, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments where task objectives, constraints, environmental factors, and communication scenarios frequently change. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model for resource allocation optimizer (LLM-RAO), a novel approach that harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to address the complex resource allocation problem while adhering to QoS constraints. By employing a prompt-based tuning strategy to flexibly convey ever-changing task descriptions and requirements to the LLM, LLM-RAO demonstrates robust performance and seamless adaptability in dynamic environments without requiring extensive retraining. Simulation results reveal that LLM-RAO achieves up to a 40% performance enhancement compared to conventional DL methods and up to an $80$\% improvement over analytical approaches. Moreover, in scenarios with fluctuating communication objectives, LLM-RAO attains up to 2.9 times the performance of traditional DL-based networks.</description>

      <title>Gaussian processes for dynamics learning in model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its state-of-the-art estimation performance complemented by rigorous and non-conservative uncertainty bounds, Gaussian process regression is a popular tool for enhancing dynamical system models and coping with their inaccuracies. This has enabled a plethora of successful implementations of Gaussian process-based model predictive control in a variety of applications over the last years. However, despite its evident practical effectiveness, there are still many open questions when attempting to analyze the associated optimal control problem theoretically and to exploit the full potential of Gaussian process regression in view of safe learning-based control.
  The contribution of this review is twofold. The first is to survey the available literature on the topic, highlighting the major theoretical challenges such as (i) addressing scalability issues of Gaussian process regression; (ii) taking into account the necessary approximations to obtain a tractable MPC formulation; (iii) including online model updates to refine the dynamics description, exploiting data collected during operation. The second is to provide an extensive discussion of future research directions, collecting results on uncertainty quantification that are related to (but yet unexploited in) optimal control, among others. Ultimately, this paper provides a toolkit to study and advance Gaussian process-based model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Resolver Model Generalization for Fault Condition Modeling: A Promising Tool for Reliability Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolvers, like all electromagnetic devices, are constantly under investigation, both operationally and structurally. In this regard, proposing a modeling methodology that can save significant time without compromising accuracy is a big honor. In this study, a generalized hybrid model is suggested that, in addition to the above benefits, has sufficient capability to ease reliability study in the field of resolvers, where a large number of faulty conditions must be investigated under different operating conditions, including changes in angular velocity, voltage, and frequency of excitation; all of which are highlighted in the context of fault coverage. This model also serves as a promising tool for generating large datasets, which is advantageous for fault diagnosis. A resolver with a non-uniform air gap is chosen as a case study to challenge the suggested model, particularly in relation to eccentricity faults. We generalize the suggested model to account for the most common faulty conditions of resolvers: in-turn short circuits in signal and excitation windings, as well as static and dynamic eccentricity faults. The close agreement between the results of the suggested model and those from Time-Stepping Finite Element Analysis (TS-FEA), along with significant time savings in both healthy and faulty conditions, highlights the generality and proficiency of the suggested model. Finally, the case study is prototyped, and we verify the accuracy of the suggested model experimentally.</description>

      <title>Identifying Large-Scale Linear Parameter Varying Systems with Dynamic Mode Decomposition Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) Systems are a well-established class of nonlinear systems with a rich theory for stability analysis, control, and analytical response finding, among other aspects. Although there are works on data-driven identification of such systems, the literature is quite scarce in terms of works that tackle the identification of LPV models for large-scale systems. Since large-scale systems are ubiquitous in practice, this work develops a methodology for the local and global identification of large-scale LPV systems based on nonintrusive reduced-order modeling. The developed method is coined as DMD-LPV for being inspired in the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). To validate the proposed identification method, we identify a system described by a discretized linear diffusion equation, with the diffusion gain defined by a polynomial over a parameter. The experiments show that the proposed method can easily identify a reduced-order LPV model of a given large-scale system without the need to perform identification in the full-order dimension, and with almost no performance decay over performing a reduction, given that the model structure is well-established.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Stable Combined Adaptive Control under Finite Excitation Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter convergence relies on a stringent persistent excitation (PE) condition in adaptive control. Several works have proposed a memory term in the last decade to translate the PE condition to a feasible finite excitation (FE) condition. This work proposes a combined model reference adaptive control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with an unknown control effectiveness vector. The closed-loop system is exponentially stable under the FE condition. The exponential rate of convergence is independent of the excitation level of the regressor vector and is lower-bounded in terms of the system parameters and user-designed gains. Numerical simulation is illustrated, validating the results obtained with the proposed adaptive control.</description>

Abstract: Behind-the-Meter assets are getting more interconnected to realise new applications like flexible tariffs. Cyber-attacks on the resulting control infrastructure may impact a large number of devices, which can result in severe impact on the power system. To analyse the possible impact of such attacks we developed a graph model of the cyber-physical energy system, representing interdependencies between the control infrastructure and the power system. This model is than used for an impact analysis of cyber-attacks with different attack vectors.</description>

      <title>Robust contraction-based model predictive control for nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely known control method that has proved to be particularly effective in multivariable and constrained control. Closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility can be guaranteed by employing accurate models in prediction and suitable terminal ingredients, i.e. the terminal cost function and the terminal constraint. Issues might arise in case of model mismatches or perturbed systems, as the state predictions could be inaccurate, and nonlinear systems for which the computation of the terminal ingredients can result challenging. In this manuscript, we exploit the properties of component-wise uniformly continuous and stabilizable systems to introduce a robust contraction-based MPC for the regulation of nonlinear perturbed systems, that employs an easy-to-design terminal cost function, does not make use of terminal constraints, and selects the shortest prediction horizon that guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>System Integrity Protection Schemes in the Nordics -- a comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To increase the utilisation rate of the power system and accelerate electrification while providing a high degree of security and reliability, System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS) are of great importance. SIPS functions are automatic remedial actions, detecting abnormal conditions or contingencies in the system and taking control action to mitigate these conditions. Design, implementation, maintenance and coordination of SIPS are all important aspects for desired operation. However, different actors have chosen different approaches to using SIPS for capacity enhancement, and there are discrepancies in how capacity is valued in relation to for example complexity, reliability and risk. Additionally, definitions often vary between countries. This paper reports on a joint survey and interview study on SIPS with stakeholders and experts in the Nordic countries - including TSOs, DSOs and industry. Combined with a literature review, a comparison and analysis of how SIPS are used in the Nordics is performed, particularly in relation to ENTSO-E capacity allocation.</description>

      <title>Reachability-Based Contingency Planning against Multi-Modal Predictions with Branch MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel contingency planning framework that integrates learning-based multi-modal predictions of traffic participants into Branch Model Predictive Control (MPC). Leveraging reachability analysis, we address the computational challenges associated with Branch MPC by organizing the multitude of predictions into driving corridors. Analyzing the overlap between these corridors, their number can be reduced through pruning and clustering while ensuring safety since all prediction modes are preserved. These processed corridors directly correspond to the distinct branches of the scenario tree and provide an efficient constraint representation for the Branch MPC. We further utilize the reachability for determining maximum feasible decision postponing times, ensuring that branching decisions remain executable. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate significantly reduced computational complexity and enhanced safety and comfort.</description>

      <title>GNN-DT: Graph Neural Network Enhanced Decision Transformer for Efficient Optimization in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and efficient exploration of the solution space. This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT reduces dependence on accurate simulators and tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior DT-based approaches</description>

      <title>Policy Design for Two-sided Platforms with Participation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-sided platforms (e.g., video streaming or e-commerce), viewers and providers engage in interactive dynamics, where an increased provider population results in higher viewer utility and the increase of viewer population results in higher provider utility. Despite the importance of such "population effects" on long-term platform health, recommendation policies do not generally take the participation dynamics into account. This paper thus studies the dynamics and policy design on two-sided platforms under the population effects for the first time. Our control- and game-theoretic findings warn against the use of myopic-greedy policy and shed light on the importance of provider-side considerations (i.e., effectively distributing exposure among provider groups) to improve social welfare via population growth. We also present a simple algorithm to optimize long-term objectives by considering the population effects, and demonstrate its effectiveness in synthetic and real-data experiments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Energy Management for Autonomous Ground Robots on a Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Ground Robots (AGRs) face significant challenges due to limited energy reserve, which restricts their overall performance and availability. Prior research has focused separately on energy-efficient approaches and fleet management strategies for task allocation to extend operational time. A fleet-level scheduler, however, assumes a specific energy consumption during task allocation, requiring the AGR to fully utilize the energy for maximum performance, which contrasts with energy-efficient practices. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the combined impact of computing frequency and locomotion speed on energy consumption and performance. We analyze these variables through experiments on our prototype AGR, laying the foundation for an integrated approach that optimizes cyber-physical resources within the constraints of a specified energy budget. To tackle this challenge, we introduce PECC (Predictable Energy Consumption Controller), a framework designed to optimize computing frequency and locomotion speed to maximize performance while ensuring the system operates within the specified energy budget. We conducted extensive experiments with PECC using a real AGR and in simulations, comparing it to an energy-efficient baseline. Our results show that the AGR travels up to 17\% faster than the baseline in real-world tests and up to 31\% faster in simulations, while consuming 95\% and 91\% of the given energy budget, respectively. These results prove that PECC can effectively enhance AGR performance in scenarios where prioritizing the energy budget outweighs the need for energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery: An RL-based Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in learning-based methods, finding valid Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems remains challenging. Current neural network approaches face two main issues: challenges in scalable verification and limited interpretability. To address these, we propose an end-to-end framework using transformers to construct analytical Lyapunov functions (local), which simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides valuable insights for control engineers. Our framework consists of a transformer-based trainer that generates candidate Lyapunov functions and a falsifier that verifies candidate expressions and refines the model via risk-seeking policy gradient. Unlike Alfarano et al. (2024), which utilizes pre-training and seeks global Lyapunov functions for low-dimensional systems, our model is trained from scratch via reinforcement learning (RL) and succeeds in finding local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial systems. Given the analytical nature of the candidates, we employ efficient optimization methods for falsification during training and formal verification tools for the final verification. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a range of nonlinear dynamical systems with up to ten dimensions and show that it can discover Lyapunov functions not previously identified in the control literature.</description>

      <title>Backcasting Policies in Transport Systems as an Optimal Control Problem : An Example with Electric Vehicle Purchase Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study represents a first attempt to build a backcasting methodology to identify the optimal policy roadmaps in transport systems. Specifically, it considers a passenger car fleet subsystem, modelling its evolution and greenhouse gas emissions. The policy decision under consideration is the monetary incentive to the purchase of electric vehicles. This process is cast as an optimal control problem with the objective to minimize the total budget of the state and reach a desired CO$_2$ target. A case study applied to Metropolitan France is presented to illustrate the approach. Additionally, alternative policy scenarios are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Achieving Hiding and Smart Anti-Jamming Communication: A Parallel DRL Approach against Moving Reactive Jammer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of anti-jamming in moving reactive jamming scenarios. The moving reactive jammer initiates high-power tracking jamming upon detecting any transmission activity, and when unable to detect a signal, resorts to indiscriminate jamming. This presents dual imperatives: maintaining hiding to avoid the jammer's detection and simultaneously evading indiscriminate jamming. Spread spectrum techniques effectively reduce transmitting power to elude detection but fall short in countering indiscriminate jamming. Conversely, changing communication frequencies can help evade indiscriminate jamming but makes the transmission vulnerable to tracking jamming without spread spectrum techniques to remain hidden. Current methodologies struggle with the complexity of simultaneously optimizing these two requirements due to the expansive joint action spaces and the dynamics of moving reactive jammers. To address these challenges, we propose a parallelized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy. The approach includes a parallelized network architecture designed to decompose the action space. A parallel exploration-exploitation selection mechanism replaces the $\varepsilon $-greedy mechanism, accelerating convergence. Simulations demonstrate a nearly 90\% increase in normalized throughput.</description>

      <title>H-MBR: Hypervisor-level Memory Bandwidth Reservation for Mixed Criticality Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in fields such as automotive and aerospace have driven a growing demand for robust computational resources. Applications that were once designed for basic MCUs are now deployed on highly heterogeneous SoC platforms. While these platforms deliver the necessary computational performance, they also present challenges related to resource sharing and predictability. These challenges are particularly pronounced when consolidating safety and non-safety-critical systems, the so-called Mixed-Criticality Systems (MCS) to adhere to strict SWaP-C requirements. MCS consolidation on shared platforms requires stringent spatial and temporal isolation to comply with functional safety standards. Virtualization, mainly leveraged by hypervisors, is a key technology that ensures spatial isolation across multiple OSes and applications; however, ensuring temporal isolation remains challenging due to contention on shared hardwar resources, which impacts real-time performance and predictability. To mitigate this problem, several strategies as cache coloring and memory bandwidth reservation have been proposed. Although cache coloring is typically implemented on state-of-the-art hypervisors, memory bandwidth reservation approaches are commonly implemented at the Linux kernel level or rely on dedicated hardware and typically do not consider the concept of VMs that can run different OSes. To fill the gap between current memory bandwidth reservation solutions and the deployment of MCSs that operate on a hypervisor, this work introduces H-MBR, an open-source VM-centric memory bandwidth reservation mechanism. H-MBR features (i) VM-centric bandwidth reservation, (ii) OS and platform agnosticism, and (iii) reduced overhead. Empirical results evidenced no overhead on non-regulated workloads, and negligible overhead (&lt;1%) for regulated workloads for regulation periods of 2 us or higher.</description>

      <title>A Null Space Compliance Approach for Maintaining Safety and Tracking Performance in Human-Robot Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the focus on developing robot manipulators has shifted towards prioritizing safety in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Impedance control is a typical approach for interaction control in collaboration tasks. However, such a control approach has two main limitations: 1) the end-effector (EE)'s limited compliance to adapt to unknown physical interactions, and 2) inability of the robot body to compliantly adapt to unknown physical interactions. In this work, we present an approach to address these drawbacks. We introduce a modified Cartesian impedance control method combined with a Dynamical System (DS)-based motion generator, aimed at enhancing the interaction capability of the EE without compromising main task tracking performance. This approach enables human coworkers to interact with the EE on-the-fly, e.g. tool changeover, after which the robot compliantly resumes its task. Additionally, combining with a new null space impedance control method enables the robot body to exhibit compliant behaviour in response to interactions, avoiding serious injuries from accidental contact while mitigating the impact on main task tracking performance. Finally, we prove the passivity of the system and validate the proposed approach through comprehensive comparative experiments on a 7 Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) KUKA LWR IV+ robot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearising the dynamics of nonlinear mechanical systems is an important and open research area. A common approach is feedback linearisation, which is a nonlinear control method that transforms the input-output response of a nonlinear system into an equivalent linear one. The main problem with feedback linearisation is that it requires an accurate first-principles model of the system, which are typically hard to obtain. In this paper, we design an alternative control approach that exploits data-driven models to linearise the input-output response of nonlinear mechanical systems. Specifically, a model-based reference tracking architecture is developed for nonlinear feedback systems with output nonlinearities. The overall methodology shows a high degree of performance combined with significant robustness against imperfect modelling and extrapolation. These findings are demonstrated using large set of synthetic experiments conducted on a asymmetric Duffing oscillator and using an experimental prototype of a high-precision motion system.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Islanding in Inverter-Based Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15454v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decentralization of modern power systems challenges the hierarchical structure of the electric grid and necessitates automated schemes to manage adverse conditions. This work proposes an adaptive isolation methodology that can divide a grid into autonomous islands, ensuring stable and economical operation amid deliberate or unintentional abnormal events. The adaptive isolation logic is event-triggered to prevent false positives, enhance detection accuracy, and reduce computational overhead. A measurement-based stable kernel representation (SKR) triggering mechanism initially inspects distributed generation controllers for abnormal behavior. The SKR then alerts an ensemble classifier to assess whether the system behavior remains within acceptable operational limits. The event-triggered adaptive isolation framework is evaluated using IEEE RTS-24 and 118-bus systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework detects anomalous behavior with 100% accuracy in real-time, i.e., within 22msec. Supply-adequate partitions are identified outperforming traditional islanding detection and formation techniques while minimizing operating costs.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a nonlinear magnetics model for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs) that accurately captures the effects of magnetic saturation in the machine iron and variations in rotor temperature on the permanent magnet excitation. The proposed model considers the permanent magnet as a current source rather than the more commonly used flux-linkage source. A comparison of the two modelling approaches is conducted using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for different machine designs as well as experimental validation, where it is shown that the proposed model has substantially better accuracy. The proposed model decouples magnetic saturation and rotor temperature effects in the current/flux-linkage relationship, allowing for adaptive estimation of the PM excitation.</description>

Abstract: Oscillatory behavior is ubiquitous in many natural and engineered systems, often emerging through self-regulating mechanisms. In this paper, we address the challenge of stabilizing a desired oscillatory pattern in a networked system where neither the internal dynamics nor the interconnections can be changed. To achieve this, we propose two distinct control strategies. The first requires the full knowledge of the system generating the desired oscillatory pattern, while the second only needs local error information. In addition, the controllers are implemented as co-evolutionary, or adaptive, rules of some edges in an extended plant-controller network. We validate our approach in several insightful scenarios, including synchronization and systems with time-varying network structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world system control requires both high-performing and interpretable controllers. Model-based control policies have gained popularity by using historical data to learn system costs and dynamics before implementation. However, this two-phase approach prevents these policies from achieving optimal control as the metrics that we train these models (e.g., mean squared errors) often differ from the actual control system cost. In this paper, we present DiffOP, a Differentiable Optimization-based Policy for optimal control. In the proposed framework, control actions are derived by solving an optimization, where the control cost function and system's dynamics can be parameterized as neural networks. Our key technical innovation lies in developing a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines policy gradients with implicit differentiation through the optimization layer, enabling end-to-end training with the actual cost feedback. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove DiffOP converges to stationary points at a rate of $O(1/K)$. Empirically, DiffOP achieves state-of-the-art performance in both nonlinear control tasks and real-world building control.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the 193 bus synthetic Korean power grid (KPG 193), developed using open data sources to address recent challenges of the Korean power system. The KPG 193 test system serves as a valuable platform for decarbonization research, capturing Korean low renewable energy penetration, concentrated urban energy demand, and isolated grid structure. Clustering techniques were applied to preserve key system characteristics while maintaining computational tractability and representativeness. The system includes 193 buses, 123 generators, 407 transmission lines, and incorporates temporal weather datasets. Its feasibility was validated through Unit Commitment (UC) and AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) simulations using 2022 demand and renewable generation data. This test system aims to provide a foundational framework for modeling and analyzing the Korean power grid.</description>

Abstract: The dynamic regressor extension and mixing procedure is employed to redesign a conventional adaptive observer algorithm for affine systems. A reduced-order observer is designed without the construction of the state transition matrix. The dynamics of the regressor are redesigned to incorporate feedback from its extension, transforming the regressor dynamics into a perturbed damped nonlinear oscillator form. This introduces some flexibility in reducing the degradation of parameter convergence due to the lack of the transition matrix and in enhancing the excitation property of the extension matrix.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Adaptive Koopman Framework for Optic Flow-Guided Landing on Moving Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an optic flow-guided approach for achieving soft landings by resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on dynamic platforms. An offline data-driven linear model based on Koopman operator theory is developed to describe the underlying (nonlinear) dynamics of optic flow output obtained from a single monocular camera that maps to vehicle acceleration as the control input. Moreover, a novel adaptation scheme within the Koopman framework is introduced online to handle uncertainties such as unknown platform motion and ground effect, which exert a significant influence during the terminal stage of the descent process. Further, to minimize computational overhead, an event-based adaptation trigger is incorporated into an event-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to regulate optic flow and track a desired reference. A detailed convergence analysis ensures global convergence of the tracking error to a uniform ultimate bound while ensuring Zeno-free behavior. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and effectiveness in landing on dynamic platforms under ground effect and sensor noise, which compares favorably to non-adaptive event-triggered and time-triggered adaptive schemes.</description>

      <title>Scalable Distributed Reproduction Numbers of Network Epidemics with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reproduction numbers are widely used for the estimation and prediction of epidemic spreading processes over networks. However, conventional reproduction numbers of an overall network do not indicate where an epidemic is spreading. Therefore, we propose a novel notion of local distributed reproduction numbers to capture the spreading behaviors of each node in a network. We first show how to compute them and then use them to derive new conditions under which an outbreak can occur. These conditions are then used to derive new conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibrium states of the underlying epidemic model. Building upon these local distributed reproduction numbers, we define cluster distributed reproduction numbers to model the spread between clusters composed of nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the local distributed reproduction numbers can be aggregated into cluster distributed reproduction numbers at different scales. However, both local and cluster distributed reproduction numbers can reveal the frequency of interactions between nodes in a network, which raises privacy concerns. Thus, we next develop a privacy framework that implements a differential privacy mechanism to provably protect the frequency of interactions between nodes when computing distributed reproduction numbers. Numerical experiments show that, even under differential privacy, the distributed reproduction numbers provide accurate estimates of the epidemic spread while also providing more insights than conventional reproduction numbers.</description>

      <title>Secure Data Reconstruction: A Direct Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of secure data reconstruction for unknown systems, where data collected from the system are susceptible to malicious manipulation. We aim to recover the real trajectory without prior knowledge of the system model. To achieve this, a behavioral language is used to represent the system, describing it using input/output trajectories instead of state-space models. We consider two attack scenarios. In the first scenario, up to $k$ entries of the collected data are malicious. On the other hand, the second scenario assumes that at most $k$ channels from sensors or actuators can be compromised, implying that any data collected from these channels might be falsified. For both scenarios, we formulate the trajectory recovery problem as an optimization problem and introduce sufficient conditions to ensure successful recovery of the true data. Since finding exact solutions to these problems can be computationally inefficient, we further approximate them using an $\ell_1$-norm and group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). We demonstrate that under certain conditions, these approximation problems also find the true trajectory while maintaining low computation complexity. Finally, we extend the proposed algorithms to noisy data. By reconstructing the secure trajectory, this work serves as a safeguard mechanism for subsequent data-driven control methods.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions for Collision Avoidance Between Strongly Convex Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on non-conservative collision avoidance between robots and obstacles with control affine dynamics and convex shapes. System safety is defined using the minimum distance between the safe regions associated with robots and obstacles. However, collision avoidance using the minimum distance as a control barrier function (CBF) can pose challenges because the minimum distance is implicitly defined by an optimization problem and thus nonsmooth in general. We identify a class of state-dependent convex sets, defined as strongly convex maps, for which the minimum distance is continuously differentiable, and the distance derivative can be computed using KKT solutions of the minimum distance problem. In particular, our formulation allows for ellipsoid-polytope collision avoidance and convex set algebraic operations on strongly convex maps. We show that the KKT solutions for strongly convex maps can be rapidly and accurately updated along state trajectories using a KKT solution ODE. Lastly, we propose a QP incorporating the CBF constraints and prove strong safety under minimal assumptions on the QP structure. We validate our approach in simulation on a quadrotor system navigating through an obstacle-filled corridor and demonstrate that CBF constraints can be enforced in real time for state-dependent convex sets without overapproximations.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows of Linear Programs and State-Action Natural Policy Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kakade's natural policy gradient method has been studied extensively in recent years, showing linear convergence with and without regularization. We study another natural gradient method based on the Fisher information matrix of the state-action distributions which has received little attention from the theoretical side. Here, the state-action distributions follow the Fisher-Rao gradient flow inside the state-action polytope with respect to a linear potential. Therefore, we study Fisher-Rao gradient flows of linear programs more generally and show linear convergence with a rate that depends on the geometry of the linear program. Equivalently, this yields an estimate on the error induced by entropic regularization of the linear program which improves existing results. We extend these results and show sublinear convergence for perturbed Fisher-Rao gradient flows and natural gradient flows up to an approximation error. In particular, these general results cover the case of state-action natural policy gradients.</description>

      <title>A continuous-time violation-free multi-agent optimization algorithm and its applications to safe distributed control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a continuous-time distributed optimization algorithm with guaranteed zero coupling constraint violation and apply it to safe distributed control in the presence of multiple control barrier functions (CBF). The optimization problem is defined over a network that collectively minimizes a separable cost function with coupled linear constraints. An equivalent optimization problem with auxiliary decision variables and a decoupling structure is proposed. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the subgradient information can be computed using local information. This then leads to a subgradient algorithm for updating the auxiliary variables. A case with sparse coupling constraints is further considered, and it is shown to have better memory and communication efficiency. For the specific case of a CBF-induced time-varying quadratic program (QP), an update law is proposed that achieves finite-time convergence. Numerical results involving a static resource allocation problem and a safe coordination problem for a multi-agent system demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Embedding Safety into RL: A New Take on Trust Region Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can solve diverse tasks but often exhibit unsafe behavior. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Cruising: Reinforcement Learning-Based Time-Headway Control for Increased Traffic Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of connected automated vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a potentially practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</description>

      <title>Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>SafePR: Unified Approach for Safe Parallel Robots by Contact Detection and Reaction with Redundancy Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast and safe motion is crucial for the successful deployment of physically interactive robots. Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for higher speeds while maintaining the same energy limits due to their low moving masses. However, they require methods for contact detection and reaction while avoiding singularities and self-collisions. We address this issue and present SafePR - a unified approach for the detection and localization, including the distinction between collision and clamping to perform a reaction that is safe for humans and feasible for PRs. Our approach uses information from the encoders and motor currents to estimate forces via a generalized-momentum observer. Neural networks and particle filters classify and localize the contacts. We introduce reactions with redundancy resolution to avoid type-II singularities and self-collisions. Our approach detected and terminated 72 real-world collision and clamping contacts with end-effector speeds of up to 1.5 m/s, each within 25-275 ms. The forces were below the thresholds from ISO/TS 15066. By using built-in sensors, SafePR enables safe interaction with already assembled PRs without the need for new hardware components.</description>
