      <title>Inverse Cluster Magnification Problem and Cluster Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired from the work of M Krithika and P Vanchinathan on Cluster Magnification, we state the Inverse Cluster Magnification Problem in this article and establish an equivalent criterion for that. We provide an important example answering a question about Cluster Towers. We also provide some generalisations and alternate proofs of results of Perlis and results of Krithika and Vanchinathan on Cluster Size.</description>

      <title>Schreier split extensions of quantale enriched monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study Schreier split extensions of monoids enriched with a relation taking values on a quantale, to which we call quantale enriched monoids. Schreier split extensions play, in the setting of monoids, the role of split extensions of groups. As such, they are closely related to semidirect products of monoids. In this paper, we investigate the possible quantale-enriched structures on semidirect products of monoids appearing in a Schreier split extension. We then restrict our study to a class of quantale enriched monoids whose behavior mimics the fact that the preorder on a preordered group is completely determined by the its of positive elements. Finally, we instantiate our results for preordered monoids and compare them with existing literature.</description>

      <title>Primitive permutation groups of finite Morley rank and affine type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a review of one of the lines in development of the theory of groups of finite Morley rank. These groups naturally appear in model theory as model-theoretic analogues of Galois groups, therefore their actions and their role as permutation groups is of primary interest. We restrict our story to the study of connected groups of finite Morley rank $G$ acting in a definably primitive way on a set $X$ and containing a definable abelian normal subgroup $V$ which acts on $X$ regularly -- the so-called \emph{primitive groups of affine type}. For reasons explained in the paper, this case plays a central role in the theory.</description>

      <title>Huppert's Conjecture for finite simple exceptional groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\textrm{cd}(G)$ be the set of all complex irreducible character degrees of $G.$ In this paper, we show that if $\textrm{cd}(G)=\textrm{cd}(H),$ where $H$ is a finite simple exceptional group of Lie type, then $G\cong H\times A,$ where $A$ is an abelian group. This completes the verification of Huppert's Conjecture for all finite simple exceptional groups of Lie type.</description>

      <title>Finitely generated groups and harmonic functions of slow growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are mainly concerned with $(\mathbb{G},\mu)$-harmonic functions that grow at most polynomially, where $\mathbb{G}$ is a finitely generated group with a probability measure $\mu$. In the initial part of the paper, we focus on Lipschitz harmonic functions and how they descend onto finite index subgroups. We discuss the relations between Lipschitz harmonic functions and harmonic functions of linear growth and conclude that for groups of polynomial growth, they coincide. In the latter part of the paper, we specialise to positive harmonic functions and give a characterisation for strong Liouville property in terms of the Green's function. We show that the existence of a non-constant positive harmonic function of polynomial growth guarantees that the group cannot have polynomial growth.</description>

      <title>Computing the unit group of a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra, i.e., for a commutative ring $R$ whose additive group is finitely generated, it is known that the group of units of $R$ is finitely generated, as well. Our main results are algorithms to compute generators and the structure of this group. This is achieved by reducing the task first to the case of reduced rings, then to torsion-free reduced rings, and finally to an order in a reduced ring. The simplified cases are treated via a calculation of exponent lattices and various algorithms to compute the minimal primes, primitive idempotents, and other basic objects. All algorithms have been implemented and are available as a SageMath package. Whenever possible, the time complexity of the described methods is tracked carefully.</description>

Abstract: We determine the automorphism groups of the orbifold vertex operator algebras associated with the coinvariant lattices of isometries of the Leech lattice in the conjugacy classes 3C, 5C, 11A and 23A. These orbifold vertex operator algebras appear in a classification given by C.H. Lam and H. Shimakura.</description>

      <title>Slice closures of indexed languages and word equations with counting constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indexed languages are a classical notion in formal language theory. As the language equivalent of second-order pushdown automata, they have received considerable attention in higher-order model checking. Unfortunately, counting properties are notoriously difficult to decide for indexed languages: So far, all results about non-regular counting properties show undecidability.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of slice closures of (Parikh images of) indexed languages. A slice is a set of vectors of natural numbers such that membership of $u,u+v,u+w$ implies membership of $u+v+w$. Our main result is that given an indexed language $L$, one can compute a semilinear representation of the smallest slice containing $L$'s Parikh image.
  We present two applications. First, one can compute the set of all affine relations satisfied by the Parikh image of an indexed language. In particular, this answers affirmatively a question by Kobayashi: Is it decidable whether in a given indexed language, every word has the same number of $a$'s as $b$'s.
  As a second application, we show decidability of (systems of) word equations with rational constraints and a class of counting constraints: These allow us to look for solutions where a counting function (defined by an automaton) is not zero. For example, one can decide whether a word equation with rational constraints has a solution where the number of occurrences of $a$ differs between variables $X$ and $Y$.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a bi-Lipschitz rigidity theorem for a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a connected simple real algebraic group. As an application, we show that any Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a higher rank semisimple algebraic group $G$ cannot have a $C^1$-smooth slim limit set in $G/P$ for any non-maximal parabolic subgroup $P$.</description>

      <title>Orbit closures in flag varieties for the centralizer of an order-two nilpotent element : normality and resolutions for types A, B, D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let G be a reductive algebraic group in classical types A, B, D and e be an element of its Lie algebra with Z its centraliser in G for the adjoint action. We suppose that e identifies with an nilpotent matrix of order two, which guarantees the number of Z-orbits in the flag variety of G is finite. For types B, D in characteristic two, we also suppose the image of e is totally isotropic. We show that any closure Y of such orbit is normal. We also prove that Y is Cohen-Macaulay with rational singularities provided that the base field is of characteristic zero, and that Cohen-Macaulayness remains in any characteristic for type A. We exhibit a birational, rational morphism onto Y involving Schubert varieties. Our work generalizes a result by N. Perrin and E. Smirnov on Springer fibers ([PS12]).</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a number field with ring of integers $\mathfrak{O}$ and let $\mathcal{G}$ be a Chevalley group scheme not of type $\mathtt{E}_8$, $\mathtt{F}_4$ or $\mathtt{G}_2$. We use the theory of Tits buildings and a result of T\'oth on Steinberg modules to prove that $H^{\operatorname{vcd}}(\mathcal{G}(\mathfrak{O}); \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ if $\mathfrak{O}$ is Euclidean.</description>

      <title>Characters of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ and vertex operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vertex operator approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of the general linear group $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$. Green's theory of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R_G=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0}R(\GL_n(\mathbb F_q))$ as two isomorphic Fock spaces associated to two infinite-dimensional $F$-equivariant Heisenberg Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\hat{\overline{\mathbb F}}_q}$ and $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\overline{\mathbb F}_q}$, where $F$ is the Frobenius automorphism of the algebraically closed field $\overline{\mathbb F}_q$. Under this picture, the irreducible characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions, and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of vertex operators of these two types. One of the features of the current approach is a simpler identification of the Fock space $R_G$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric functions via vertex operator calculus, and another is that we are able to compute in general the character table, where Green's degree formula is demonstrated as an example.</description>
