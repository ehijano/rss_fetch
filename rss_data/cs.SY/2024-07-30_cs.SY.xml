      <title>A Modular Measurement Integrity Verification for Transformer Currents with Applications in Hardware in-the-Loop Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a recursive method for integrity verification of measured transformer currents, which is suitable for the modular development of Hardware-In-the-Loop Digital Twins (HIL DTs). The Differential Equations (DEs) describing transformer transients are relatively complex, requiring the use of numerical DE solvers with small time steps. This implies that replicating transformers with HIL DTs requires a continuous flow of accurate measurement samples with a high sampling rate. The proposed method utilizes the Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the parameters of transformer currents which can be non-sinusoidal during transients such as transformer energization. Then, after evaluating the validity of estimations, the proposed method utilizes the estimated parameters to reconstruct noiseless measurements with desirable sampling rates. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using EMTP-RV for simulating transformers and Matlab for executing the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate that the method is able to accurately estimate and closely track the current measurements.</description>

      <title>TERIME: An improved RIME algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation for robust parameter extraction of photovoltaic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter extraction of photovoltaic (PV) models is crucial for the planning, optimization, and control of PV systems. Although some methods using meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed to determine these parameters, the robustness of solutions obtained by these methods faces great challenges when the complexity of the PV model increases. The unstable results will affect the reliable operation and maintenance strategies of PV systems. In response to this challenge, an improved RIME algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation is proposed for robust and accurate parameter identification for various PV models. Specifically, the differential evolution mutation operator is integrated in the exploration phase to enhance the population diversity. Meanwhile, a new exploitation strategy incorporating randomization and neighborhood strategies simultaneously is developed to maintain the balance of exploitation width and depth. The improved RIME algorithm is applied to estimate the optimal parameters of the single-diode model (SDM), double-diode model (DDM), and triple-diode model (TDM) combined with the Lambert-W function for three PV cell and module types including RTC France, Photo Watt-PWP 201 and S75. According to the statistical analysis in 100 runs, the TEIMRE achieves more accurate and robust parameter estimations than other techniques to various PV models in varying environmental conditions. All of our source codes are publicly available at https://github.com/dirge1/TERIME.</description>

      <title>State estimation for a class of nonlinear time-varying uncertain system under multiharmonic disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the observer synthesis for nonlinear, time-varying plants with uncertain parameters under multiharmonic disturbance. It is assumed that the relative degree of the plant is known, the regressor linearly depends on the state vector and may have a nonlinear relationship with the output signal. The proposed solution consists of three steps. Initially, an unknown input state observer is synthesized. This observer, however, necessitates the measurement of output derivatives equal to the plant's relative degree. To relax this limitation, an alternative representation of the observer is introduced. Further, based on this observer, the unknown parameters and disturbances are reconstructed using an autoregression model and the dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) approach. This approach allows the estimates to be obtained in a finite time. Finally, based on these estimates, an observer has been constructed that does not require measurements of the output derivatives. The effectiveness and efficiency of this solution are demonstrated through a computer simulation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Equitable Load Shedding: Real-time Solution via Learning Binding Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely and effective load shedding in power systems is critical for maintaining supply-demand balance and preventing cascading blackouts. To eliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system, optimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between economical and equity considerations. However, the resulting optimization problem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and thus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to enable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding problem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC system have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for delivering equitable and real-time load shedding decisions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Target Tracking Using Retrospective Cost Input Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target tracking of surrounding vehicles is essential for collision avoidance in autonomous vehicles. Our approach to target tracking is based on causal numerical differentiation on relative position data to estimate relative velocity and acceleration. Causal numerical differentiation is useful for a wide range of estimation and control problems with application to robotics and autonomous systems. The present paper extends prior work on causal numerical differentiation based on retrospective cost input estimation (RCIE). Since the variance of the input-estimation error and its correlation with the state-estimation error (the sum of the variance and the correlation is denoted as $\widetilde{V}$) used in the Kalman filter update are unknown, the present paper considers an adaptive discrete-time Kalman filter, where $\widetilde{V}_k$ is updated at each time step $k$ to minimize the difference between the sample variance of the innovations and the variance of the innovations given by the Kalman filter. The performance of this approach is shown to reach the performance of numerical differentiation based on RCIE with the best possible fixed value of $\widetilde{V}_k$. The proposed method thus eliminates the need to determine the best possible fixed value for $\widetilde{V}_k$. Finally, RCIE with an adaptive Kalman filter is applied to target tracking of a vehicle using simulated data from CarSim.</description>

      <title>Network-Based Epidemic Control Through Optimal Travel and Quarantine Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the swift global transmission of infectious diseases, we present a comprehensive framework for network-based epidemic control. Our aim is to curb epidemics using two different approaches. In the first approach, we introduce an optimization strategy that optimally reduces travel rates. We analyze the convergence of this strategy and show that it hinges on the network structure to minimize infection spread. In the second approach, we expand the classic SIR model by incorporating and optimizing quarantined states to strategically contain the epidemic. We show that this problem reduces to the problem of matrix balancing. We establish a link between optimization constraints and the epidemic's reproduction number, highlighting the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics. We demonstrate that applying augmented primal-dual gradient dynamics to the optimal quarantine problem ensures exponential convergence to the KKT point. We conclude by validating our approaches using simulation studies that leverage public data from counties in the state of Massachusetts.</description>

      <title>Impact of Transmission Dynamics and Treatment Uptake, Frequency and Timing on the Cost-effectiveness of Directly Acting Antivirals for Hepatitis C Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cost-effectiveness analyses, based on decision-analytic models of disease progression and treatment, are routinely used to assess the economic value of a new intervention and consequently inform reimbursement decisions for the intervention. Many decision-analytic models developed to assess the economic value of highly effective directly acting antiviral (DAA) treatments for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection do not incorporate the transmission dynamics of HCV, accounting for which is required to estimate the number of downstream infections prevented by curing an infection. In this study, we develop and validate a comprehensive agent-based simulation (ABS) model of HCV transmission dynamics in the Indian context and use it to: (a) quantify the extent to which the cost-effectiveness of a DAA is underestimated - as a function of its uptake rate - if disease transmission dynamics are not considered in a cost-effectiveness analysis model; and (b) quantify the impact of the frequency and timing of treatment with DAAs, also as a function of their uptake rate, within a disease surveillance period on its cost-effectiveness. The process of accomplishing the above research objectives also motivated the development of a novel random sampling and allocation based approach, along with associated theoretical grounding, to estimate individual-level outcomes within an ABS that incurs substantially lower computational expense than the benchmark incremental accumulation approach.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Expansion-Based Robust Power Flow in Unbalanced Distribution Systems: A Hybrid Data-Aided Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional power flow methods often adopt certain assumptions designed for passive balanced distribution systems, thus lacking practicality for unbalanced operation. Moreover, their computation accuracy and efficiency are heavily subject to unknown errors and bad data in measurements or prediction data of distributed energy resources (DERs). To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid data-aided robust power flow algorithm in unbalanced distribution systems, which combines Taylor series expansion knowledge with a data-driven regression technique. The proposed method initiates a linearization power flow model to derive an explicitly analytical solution by modified Taylor expansion. To mitigate the approximation loss that surges due to the DER integration and bad data, we further develop a data-aided robust support vector regression approach to estimate the errors efficiently. Comparative analysis in the 13-bus and 123-bus IEEE unbalanced feeders shows that the proposed algorithm achieves superior computational efficiency, with guaranteed accuracy and robustness against outliers.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Locality: Definition and Initial Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.</description>

      <title>Real Time Safety of Fixed-wing UAVs using Collision Cone Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed-wing UAVs have transformed the transportation system with their high flight speed and long endurance, yet their safe operation in increasingly cluttered environments depends heavily on effective collision avoidance techniques. This paper presents a novel method for safely navigating an aircraft along a desired route while avoiding moving obstacles. We utilize a class of control barrier functions (CBFs) based on collision cones to ensure the relative velocity between the aircraft and the obstacle consistently avoids a cone of vectors that might lead to a collision. By demonstrating that the proposed constraint is a valid CBF for the aircraft, we can leverage its real-time implementation via Quadratic Programs (QPs), termed the CBF-QPs. Validation includes simulating control law along trajectories, showing effectiveness in both static and moving obstacle scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Baseline Approach for Modeling and Characterization of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Droop Controlled Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to advancements in power electronics, new converter topologies are introduced day by day. It's hard to get an equivalent model from any manufacturer of any Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) power electronics converters because of intellectual property (IP) and safety concerns. Most COTS products don't reveal the exact topology of the converter as well as the control architecture and corresponding control gains. Because of these reasons, it's very hard to implement an exact equivalent model of COTS converters. Hierarchical control is widely used in microgrid applications, where different control layers are decoupled on the timescale. This article gives a baseline approach to build an equivalent model of any droop controlled COTS converter to mimic its control performance. Bandwidths of the different control loops are estimated along with the control logic from experiments on COTS converter and then hierarchical control is followed to come up with the equivalent model. The approach is verified on COTS CE+T Stabiliti 30C3 converter with its equivalent model build in MATLAB Simulink.</description>

      <title>Passivity based Stability Assessment for Four types of Droops for DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DC microgrids are getting more and more applications due to simple converters, only voltage control and higher efficiencies compared to conventional AC grids. Droop control is a well know decentralized control strategy for power sharing among converter interfaced sources and loads in a DC microgrid. This work compares the stability assessment and control of four types of droops for boost converters using the concept of passivity. EN standard 50388-2 for railway systems provides a reference to ensure system stability in perspectives of converters and system integration. Low pass filter (LPF) in the feedback of the droop control is used to ensure converter passivity. Bus impedance is derived to ensure system passivity with less conservativeness. Analytical approach for design of passive controller for all four types of droops is verified through time domain simulations of a single boost converter based microgrid feeding a Constant Power Load (CPL).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing demand for simulators for the research and development of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) and the approval of autonomous navigation algorithms. Simulators are used for purposes such as evaluation and training and are taken on various configurations accordingly. The ship maneuvering mathematical model used in such a simulator is an important element that characterizes the simulator. In this paper, we discuss the dynamic model of the hull and its position in the simulator that will be required for MASSs in the future. It also discusses guidelines for selecting an appropriate model, which has not been discussed extensively in previous studies. Finally, we discuss the functional requirements that simulators should have.</description>

      <title>ProRuka: A highly efficient HMI algorithm for controlling a novel prosthetic hand with 6-DOF using sonomyography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sonomyography (SMG) is a novel human-machine interface that controls upper-limb prostheses by monitoring forearm muscle activity using ultrasonic imaging. SMG has been investigated for controlling upper-limb prostheses during the last two decades. The results show that this method, in combination with artificial intelligence, can classify different hand gestures with an accuracy of more than 90%, making it a great alternative control system compared to electromyography (EMG). However, up to now there are few reports of a system integrating SMG together with a prosthesis for testing on amputee subjects to demonstrate its capability in relation to daily activities. In this study, we developed ProRuka, a novel low-cost 6-degree-of-freedom prosthetic hand integrated with the control provided by a SMG system with a wearable ultrasound imaging probe. The classification of hand gestures using different machine learning classification/regression algorithms including KNN, nearest neighbor regression, random forest, decision tree classifier, decision tree regression, support vector regression and support vector machine in combination with a transfer learning model (VGG16) was first evaluated off-line to determine its reliability and precision. Additionally, the developed controlling system were evaluated on two amputees, in real-time experiments using a variety of hand function test kits. The results from an off-line study including ten healthy participants indicated that nine different hand motions can be classified with a success rate of 100%. In addition, the hand function test in real time (using 4 different hand gestures) confirmed that the designed prosthesis with the SMG controlling system can assist amputees to perform a variety of hand movements needed in daily activities.</description>

      <title>Design and Testing for Steel Support Axial Force Servo System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation excavations are deepening, expanding, and approaching structures. Steel supports measure and manage axial force. The study regulates steel support structure power during deep excavation using a novel axial force management system for safety, efficiency, and structural integrity. Closed-loop control changes actuator output to maintain axial force based on force. In deep excavation, the servo system regulates unstable soil, side pressure, and structural demands. Modern engineering and tech are used. Temperature changes automatically adjust the jack to maintain axial force. Includes hydraulic jacks, triple-acting cylinders, temperature, and deformation sensors, and automatic control. Foundation pit excavation is dynamic, yet structure tension is constant. There is no scientific way to regulate axial force foundation pit excavation. The revolutionary Servo system adjusts temperature, compression, and axial force to deform pits. System control requires foundation pit direction detection and modification. This engineering method has performed effectively for deep foundation pit excavation at railway crossings and other infrastructure projects. The surrounding protective structure may reduce the steel support's axial stress, making deep foundation excavation safe and efficient. Keywords: Servo systems, Steel strut support design, Deformation control, Monitoring and control, Deep excavation projects.</description>

      <title>Culsans: An Efficient Snoop-based Coherency Unit for the CVA6 Open Source RISC-V application processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) based on cache coherency is crucial for high-end embedded systems like automotive applications. RISC-V is gaining traction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues such as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent RISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core clusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a lightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our design uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with Splash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a dual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized using GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of the system area.</description>

      <title>Minimum Time Consensus of Multi-agent System under Fuel Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of finding a consensus point in the state space ($\mathbb{R}^2$) for a multi-agent system that is comprised of $N$ identical double integrator agents. It is assumed that each agent operates under constrained control input (i.e., $|u_i(t)| \leq 1$ $\forall i = 1, \hdots N$). Further, a fixed fuel budget is also assumed i.e., the total amount of cumulative input that can be expended is limited by $\int_0^{t_f}|u(t)|dt \le \beta$. First, the attainable set $\mathcal{A}(t,x_0,\beta)$ at time $t$, which is the set of all states that an agent can attain starting from initial conditions $x_0$ under the fuel budget constraints at time $t$ is computed for every agent. This attainable set is a convex set for all $t\ge0$. Then the minimum time to consensus is the minimum time $\bar{t}$ at which attainable sets of all agents intersect, and the consensus point is the point of intersection. A closed-form expression for the minimum time consensus point is provided for the case of three agents. Then, using Helly's theorem, the intersection will be non-empty at a time when all the $N \choose 3$ triplets of agents have non-empty intersection. The computation of minimum time consensus for all $N \choose 3$ triplets is performed independently and can be distributed among all the $N$ agents. Finally, the overall minimum time to consensus is given by the triplet that has the highest minimum time to consensus. Further, the intersection of all the attainable sets of this triplet gives the minimum time consensus point for all $N$ agents.</description>

      <title>A Family of Switching Pursuit Strategies for a Multi-Pursuer Single-Evader Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new family of pursuit strategies is introduced for a multi-pursuer single-evader game. By exploiting the optimal solution of the game involving two pursuers, conditions are derived under which the multi-pursuer game becomes equivalent to the two-pursuer one. This opens the possibility of designing a number of pursuit strategies in which the pursuers first try to enforce the satisfaction of the aforementioned condition and then switch to a two-pursuer game as soon as it is verified. The contribution is useful in two ways. First, new winning pursuit strategies can be devised starting from simple plans, such as pure pursuit. Moreover, the performance of existing pursuit strategies, like those based on Voronoi partitions, can be significantly improved by resorting to the corresponding switching version.</description>

      <title>As Transparent as Possible, System Implementation Governance Using Process Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advocates for guiding an effective system implementation approach at a business process level. It details a case study of a food product manufacturer that transitioned to a new local information system. 41 units' data (10160 cases) over the pre-maturity phase of the system were then structured into event logs and analyzed. This analysis identified deviant process paths, questioning whether the new system efficiently supports procurement operations immediately post-implementation. The findings reveal critical implementation risks with conformance-checking of the as-is process with the to-be process model; this includes incomplete cases, unauthorized activities, irregular payment practices, stemming from organizational bottlenecks, or violating internal control regulations. Challenges are attributed to technical shortcomings in system design and cultural misalignments, necessitating immediate interventions or longer-term cultural and training solutions. This study's contribution is its demonstration of a transparent, process-driven approach to system governance, highlighting the strategic benefits of this integration for organizational management.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning for Adaptive Control with Automated Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive control achieves concurrent parameter learning and stable control under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear features. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features. To address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating meta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data. However, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation laws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient representations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain dynamics.</description>

      <title>A maturity framework for data driven maintenance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintenance decisions range from the simple detection of faults to ultimately predicting future failures and solving the problem. These traditionally human decisions are nowadays increasingly supported by data and the ultimate aim is to make them autonomous. This paper explores the challenges encountered in data driven maintenance, and proposes to consider four aspects in a maturity framework: data / decision maturity, the translation from the real world to data, the computability of decisions (using models) and the causality in the obtained relations. After a discussion of the theoretical concepts involved, the exploration continues by considering a practical fault detection and identification problem. Two approaches, i.e. experience based and model based, are compared and discussed in terms of the four aspects in the maturity framework. It is observed that both approaches yield the same decisions, but still differ in the assignment of causality. This confirms that a maturity assessment not only concerns the type of decision, but should also include the other proposed aspects.</description>

      <title>A Fault Prognostic System for the Turbine Guide Bearings of a Hydropower Plant Using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydroelectricity, being a renewable source of energy, globally fulfills the electricity demand. Hence, Hydropower Plants (HPPs) have always been in the limelight of research. The fast-paced technological advancement is enabling us to develop state-of-the-art power generation machines. This has not only resulted in improved turbine efficiency but has also increased the complexity of these systems. In lieu thereof, efficient Operation &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) of such intricate power generation systems has become a more challenging task. Therefore, there has been a shift from conventional reactive approaches to more intelligent predictive approaches in maintaining the HPPs. The research is therefore targeted to develop an artificially intelligent fault prognostics system for the turbine bearings of an HPP. The proposed method utilizes the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm in developing the model. Initially, the model is trained and tested with bearing vibration data from a test rig. Subsequently, it is further trained and tested with realistic bearing vibration data obtained from an HPP operating in Pakistan via the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The model demonstrates highly effective predictions of bearing vibration values, achieving a remarkably low RMSE.</description>

      <title>Real-time Uncertainty-Aware Motion Planning for Magnetic-based Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization in GPS-denied environments is critical for autonomous systems, and traditional methods like SLAM have limitations in generalizability across diverse environments. Magnetic-based navigation (MagNav) offers a robust solution by leveraging the ubiquity and unique anomalies of external magnetic fields. This paper proposes a real-time uncertainty-aware motion planning algorithm for MagNav, using onboard magnetometers and information-driven methodologies to adjust trajectories based on real-time localization confidence. This approach balances the trade-off between finding the shortest or most energy-efficient routes and reducing localization uncertainty, enhancing navigational accuracy and reliability. The novel algorithm integrates an uncertainty-driven framework with magnetic-based localization, creating a real-time adaptive system capable of minimizing localization errors in complex environments. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the method, demonstrating significant reductions in localization uncertainty and the feasibility of real-time implementation. The paper also details the mathematical modeling of uncertainty, the algorithmic foundation of the planning approach, and the practical implications of using magnetic fields for localization. Future work includes incorporating a global path planner to address the local nature of the current guidance law, further enhancing the method's suitability for long-duration operations.</description>

      <title>Addressing Behavior Model Inaccuracies for Safe Motion Control in Uncertain Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainties in the environment and behavior model inaccuracies compromise the state estimation of a dynamic obstacle and its trajectory predictions, introducing biases in estimation and shifts in predictive distributions. Addressing these challenges is crucial to safely control an autonomous system. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm SIED-MPC, which synergistically integrates Simultaneous State and Input Estimation (SSIE) and Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control (DR-MPC) using model confidence evaluation. The SSIE process produces unbiased state estimates and optimal input gap estimates to assess the confidence of the behavior model, defining the ambiguity radius for DR-MPC to handle predictive distribution shifts. This systematic confidence evaluation leads to producing safe inputs with an adequate level of conservatism. Our algorithm demonstrated a reduced collision rate in autonomous driving simulations through improved state estimation, with a 54% shorter average computation time.</description>

      <title>A Low-Frequency Vibration Experimental Platform for University Physics Experiment Designed by LabVIEW</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual instrument technology has been increasingly used in university physics experiment teaching. An experimental platform is specifically constructed for studying low-frequency vibrations in university physics, which is based on a computer and its internal sound card, along with a program developed in LabVIEW programming environment to perform control and measurement on our experimental platform. The proposed platform effectively replaces the conventional signal generator and oscilloscope traditionally used in such experiments by integrating virtual instruments and essential experimental equipment. The platform offers various functionalities, such as synchronous transmission and reception of low-frequency signals, frequency measurement, dynamic frequency sweep measurement, and measurement using the three-point approximation method. The proposed platform has been successfully applied in experiments involving forced vibration, resonance of tuning forks, and dynamic measurement of Young's modulus. Unlike conventional low-frequency vibration experiments, the proposed experimental platform optimizes efficiency, reduces costs, and offers opportunities for enhancing the instructional content of experiments. Furthermore, the incorporation of state-of-the-art computer technology enhances students' engagement and enthusiasm for learning.</description>

      <title>B-ISAC: Backscatter Integrated Sensing and Communication for 6G IoE Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of backscatter communication (BackCom) technology with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology not only enhances the system sensing performance, but also enables low-power information transmission. This is expected to provide a new paradigm for communication and sensing in internet of everything (IoE) applications. Existing works only consider sensing rate and detection performance, while none consider the estimation performance. The design of the system in different task modes also needs to be further studied. In this paper, we propose a novel system called backscatter-ISAC (B-ISAC) and design a joint beamforming framework for different stages (task modes). We derive communication performance metrics of the system in terms of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and communication rate, and derive sensing performance metrics of the system in terms of probability of detection, estimation error of linear least squares (LS) estimation, and the estimation error of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation. The proposed joint beamforming framework consists of three stages: tag detection, tag estimation, and communication enhancement. We develop corresponding joint beamforming schemes aimed at enhancing the performance objectives of their respective stages by solving complex non-convex optimization problems. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint beamforming schemes. The proposed B-ISAC system has broad application prospect in sixth generation (6G) IoE scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Bayesian regression with trustworthy uncertainty quantification. We define that the uncertainty quantification is trustworthy if the ground truth can be captured by intervals dependent on the predictive distributions with a pre-specified probability. Furthermore, we propose, Trust-Bayes, a novel optimization framework for Bayesian meta learning which is cognizant of trustworthy uncertainty quantification without explicit assumptions on the prior model/distribution of the functions. We characterize the lower bounds of the probabilities of the ground truth being captured by the specified intervals and analyze the sample complexity with respect to the feasible probability for trustworthy uncertainty quantification. Monte Carlo simulation of a case study using Gaussian process regression is conducted for verification and comparison with the Meta-prior algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every user authentication scheme involves three login credentials, i.e. a username, a password and a hash value, but only one of them is associated with a user identity. However, this identity is actually not robust enough to protect the whole system, while the login entries (i.e., the username and password forms) have not been effectively protected. Furthermore, the extra factor in a system adding multi-factor authentication is transmitted in cyberspace and operated by users. If more identities can be employed for the two login forms to associate with all login credentials, and if the corresponding identifiers are not transmitted in cyberspace and operated by users, such a system can be more robust even without relying on a third-party service. To this end, a triple-identity authentication scheme is designed within a dual-password login-authentication system, which defines identities for the username and the login password, respectively. Therefore, in addition to the traditional server verification, the system can verify the identifiers at the username and password forms in succession. In the triple-identity authentication, the identifiers are entirely managed by the system without involvement of users or a third-party service, and they are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible and independent of personal information. Thus, they are useless in online attacks.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning for Intra-Day Power Grid Operation through Topology Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power grid operation is becoming increasingly complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. In this paper we study the performance of imitation learning for day-ahead power grid operation through topology actions. In particular, we consider two rule-based expert agents: a greedy agent and a N-1 agent. While the latter is more computationally expensive since it takes N-1 safety considerations into account, it exhibits a much higher operational performance. We train a fully-connected neural network (FCNN) on expert state-action pairs and evaluate it in two ways. First, we find that classification accuracy is limited despite extensive hyperparameter tuning, due to class imbalance and class overlap. Second, as a power system agent, the FCNN performs only slightly worse than expert agents. Furthermore, hybrid agents, which incorporate minimal additional simulations, match expert agents' performance with significantly lower computational cost. Consequently, imitation learning shows promise for developing fast, high-performing power grid agents, motivating its further exploration in future L2RPN studies.</description>

      <title>A Differential Dynamic Programming Framework for Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A differential dynamic programming (DDP)-based framework for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is introduced to recover the parameters in the cost function, system dynamics, and constraints from demonstrations. Different from existing work, where DDP was used for the inner forward problem with inequality constraints, our proposed framework uses it for efficient computation of the gradient required in the outer inverse problem with equality and inequality constraints. The equivalence between the proposed method and existing methods based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) is established. More importantly, using this DDP-based IRL with an open-loop loss function, a closed-loop IRL framework is presented. In this framework, a loss function is proposed to capture the closed-loop nature of demonstrations. It is shown to be better than the commonly used open-loop loss function. We show that the closed-loop IRL framework reduces to a constrained inverse optimal control problem under certain assumptions. Under these assumptions and a rank condition, it is proven that the learning parameters can be recovered from the demonstration data. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated through four numerical robot examples and one real-world quadrotor system. The experiments validate the theoretical results and illustrate the practical relevance of the approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shield Synthesis via State-Space Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of synthesizing safety strategies for control systems, also known as shields. Since the state space is infinite, shields are typically computed over a finite-state abstraction, with the most common abstraction being a rectangular grid. However, for many systems, such a grid does not align well with the safety property or the system dynamics. That is why a coarse grid is rarely sufficient, but a fine grid is typically computationally infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we show that appropriate state-space transformations can still allow to use a coarse grid at almost no computational overhead. We demonstrate in three case studies that our transformation-based synthesis outperforms a standard synthesis by several orders of magnitude. In the first two case studies, we use domain knowledge to select a suitable transformation. In the third case study, we instead report on results in engineering a transformation without domain knowledge.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies performance of various types of relay nodes in a 5G wireless network: conventional amplify-forward repeaters, (semi-)smart/smart amplify-forward repeaters with different levels of side information, and half-duplex/full-duplex decode-forward relay nodes with and without spatial reuse. End-to-end effective signal to interference and noise ratios (SINRs) and achievable rates are derived for these different types of relay nodes. Performance and complexity tradeoffs are discussed with a simulation over a Manhattan topology setting. Over-the-air (OTA) test results corroborates the findings in this paper.</description>

      <title>Emission Reduction in Urban Environments by Replacing Conventional City Buses with Electric Bus Technology: A Case Study of Pakistan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global transportation industry has become one of the main contributors to air pollution. Consequently, electric buses and green transportation are gaining popularity as crucial steps to reduce emission concerns. Many developed countries have already adopted the concept of Battery Electric Buses (BEBs), while the developing ones are just starting with it. However, BEB fleets have advantages, such as lower fuel, higher efficiency, lower maintenance, and energy security. Yet, several obstacles must be overcome to support the mass deployment of BEBs. These incorporate forthright expense charges, arranging loads, BEB reach, and newness to BEB innovation. Stakeholders like policymakers, private company owners, and government leaders have a lot to consider before introducing BEBs at any level in Pakistan. As a result, to operate an electric bus system profitably, it is crucial to develop a proper electric bus network and fleet, especially for bus operators who need to buy enough electric buses at the appropriate time. As a result, this paper aims to investigate if operating an electric bus could be an alternative to regular bus operations. The proposed methodology develops modeling software to cater to various scenarios to determine a proper-designed electric bus operating system in terms of the electric bus route, service frequency, and quantity. This research work simulates and financially analyses an operating Public Transport Infrastructure with a proposed Green Solution. The results show that regardless of the high upfront costs of BEB infrastructure, it becomes profitable in 6-7 years, resulting in a decreased Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of approximately 30% of its counterpart. The study also provides a clear policy pathway to help stakeholders make informed decisions related to the electrification of public transport in Pakistan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting in the air cargo industry presents unique challenges due to volatile market dynamics and the significant impact of accurate forecasts on generated revenue. This paper explores a comprehensive approach to demand forecasting at the origin-destination (O\&amp;D) level, focusing on the development and implementation of machine learning models in decision-making for the air cargo industry. We leverage a mixture of experts framework, combining statistical and advanced deep learning models to provide reliable forecasts for cargo demand over a six-month horizon. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms industry benchmarks, offering actionable insights for cargo capacity allocation and strategic decision-making in the air cargo industry. While this work is applied in the airline industry, the methodology is broadly applicable to any field where forecast-based decision-making in a volatile environment is crucial.</description>

      <title>SAPG: Split and Aggregate Policy Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extreme sample inefficiency, on-policy reinforcement learning, aka policy gradients, has become a fundamental tool in decision-making problems. With the recent advances in GPU-driven simulation, the ability to collect large amounts of data for RL training has scaled exponentially. However, we show that current RL methods, e.g. PPO, fail to ingest the benefit of parallelized environments beyond a certain point and their performance saturates. To address this, we propose a new on-policy RL algorithm that can effectively leverage large-scale environments by splitting them into chunks and fusing them back together via importance sampling. Our algorithm, termed SAPG, shows significantly higher performance across a variety of challenging environments where vanilla PPO and other strong baselines fail to achieve high performance.

      <title>ARQ-based Average Consensus over Directed Network Topologies with Unreliable Communication Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the discrete-time average consensus problem in strongly connected directed graphs, where nodes exchange information over unreliable error-prone communication links. We enhance the Robustified Ratio Consensus algorithm by exploiting features of the (Hybrid) Automatic Repeat ReQuest - (H)ARQ protocol used for error control of data transmissions, in order to allow the nodes to reach asymptotic average consensus even when information is exchanged over error-prone directional networks. This strategy, apart from handling time-varying information delays induced by retransmissions of erroneous packets, can also handle packet drops that occur when exceeding a predefined packet retransmission limit. Invoking the (H)ARQ protocol allows nodes to: (a) exploit the incoming error-free acknowledgement feedback to initially acquire or later update their out-degree, (b) know whether a packet has arrived or not, and (c) determine a local upper-bound on the delays imposed by the retransmission limit. By augmenting the network's corresponding weight matrix, we show that nodes utilizing our proposed (H)ARQ Ratio Consensus algorithm can reach asymptotic average consensus over unreliable networks, while improving their convergence speed and maintaining low values in their local buffers compared to the current state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Sequential learning and control: Targeted exploration for robust performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel dual control strategy for uncertain linear systems based on targeted harmonic exploration and gain-scheduling with performance and excitation guarantees. In the proposed sequential approach, robust control is implemented after exploration with the main feature that the exploration is optimized with respect to the robust control performance. Specifically, we leverage recent results on finite excitation using spectral lines to determine a high probability lower bound on the resultant finite excitation of the exploration data. This provides an a priori upper bound on the remaining model uncertainty after exploration, which can further be leveraged in a gain-scheduling controller design that guarantees robust performance. This leads to a semidefinite program-based design which computes an exploration strategy with finite excitation bounds and minimal energy, and a gain-scheduled controller with probabilistic performance bounds that can be implemented after exploration. The effectiveness of our approach and its benefits over common random exploration strategies are demonstrated with an example of a system which is 'hard to learn'.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Implementation of Dynamic State Estimation for Microgrid Load Bus Protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverter-interfaced microgrids, owing to the lack of fault current, cannot be protected using traditional over-current protections, while admittance or differential relaying protection schemes are not practical to be implemented. Dynamic state estimation can track and predict power system transients and has been extensively investigated for setting-less protection. A novel real-time application of dynamic state estimation for protection is proposed in this paper, wherein parameter estimation and parallel processing is used to identify the state of the system. The implementation scheme has low process complexity and employs a data acquisition device and estimator that run on a general-purpose computer. This proposed implementation extends the state-of-the-art, under short-circuit conditions, to a real-time implementation with a lumped-load radial microgrid and a grid-forming inverter with current-limiting behavior.</description>

      <title>Recomputing Solutions to Perturbed Multi-Commodity Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problems using Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Multi-Commodity Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem aims to optimize the pickup and delivery of multiple unique commodities using a fleet of several agents with limited payload capacities. This paper addresses the challenge of quickly recomputing the solution to this NP-hard problem when there are unexpected perturbations to the nominal task definitions, likely to occur under real-world operating conditions. The proposed method first decomposes the nominal problem by constructing a search tree using Monte Carlo Tree Search for task assignment, and uses a rapid heuristic for routing each agent. When changes to the problem are revealed, the nominal search tree is rapidly updated with new costs under the updated problem parameters, generating solutions quicker and with a reduced optimality gap, as compared to recomputing the solution as an entirely new problem. Computational experiments are conducted by varying the locations of the nominal problem and the payload capacity of an agent to demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing the nominal search tree to handle perturbations for real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>Reducing End-to-End Latencies of Multi-Rate Cause-Effect Chains for the LET Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Logical Execution Time (LET) model has been gaining industrial attention because of its timing and data-flow deterministic characteristics, which simplify the computation of end-to-end latencies of multi-rate cause-effect chains at the cost of pessimistic latencies. In this paper, we propose a novel method to reduce the pessimism in the latencies introduced by LET, while maintaining its determinism. We propose a schedule-aware LET model that shortens the lengths and repositions LET's communication intervals resulting in less pessimistic end-to-end latencies. By adding dependencies between specific task instances, the method can further reduce the pessimism in the latency calculations of the LET model. If needed, e.g., for legacy reasons, our method can be applied to a subset of tasks only. We evaluate our work based on real world automotive benchmarks and randomly generated synthetic task sets. We compare our results with previous work and the LET model. The experiments show significant reductions of worst-case data age and worst-case reaction latency values.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Filters with Resampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filtering is concerned with online estimation of the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations. In applications where the state of the system is high dimensional, ensemble Kalman filters are often the method of choice. These algorithms rely on an ensemble of interacting particles to sequentially estimate the state as new observations become available. Despite the practical success of ensemble Kalman filters, theoretical understanding is hindered by the intricate dependence structure of the interacting particles. This paper investigates ensemble Kalman filters that incorporate an additional resampling step to break the dependency between particles. The new algorithm is amenable to a theoretical analysis that extends and improves upon those available for filters without resampling, while also performing well in numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed continuous-time optimization for time-varying quadratic cost functions with uncertain parameters. We first propose a centralized adaptive optimization algorithm using partial information of the cost function. It can be seen that even if there are uncertain parameters in the cost function, exact optimization can still be achieved. To solve this problem in a distributed manner when different local cost functions have identical Hessians, we propose a novel distributed algorithm that cascades the fixed-time average estimator and the distributed optimizer. We remove the requirement for the upper bounds of certain complex functions by integrating state-based gains in the proposed design. We further extend this result to address the distributed optimization where the time-varying cost functions have nonidentical Hessians. We prove the convergence of all the proposed algorithms in the global sense. Numerical examples verify the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Forward Reachability Perspective on Robust Control Invariance and Discount Factors in Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control invariant sets are crucial for various methods that aim to design safe control policies for systems whose state constraints must be satisfied over an indefinite time horizon. In this article, we explore the connections among reachability, control invariance, and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Unlike prior formulations based on backward reachability concepts, by examining a forward reachability problem, we are able to establish a strong link between these three concepts. First, our findings show that the inevitable Forward Reachable Tube (FRT), which is the set of states such that every trajectory reaching the FRT must have passed through a given initial set of states, is precisely this initial set of states itself if it is a robust control invariant set with a differentiable boundary. We highlight that this statement may not hold if the boundary is not differentiable. Next, we formulate a differential game between the control and disturbance, where the inevitable FRT is characterized by the zero-superlevel set of the value function. By incorporating a discount factor in the cost function of the game, the barrier constraint of the CBF naturally arises as the constraint that is imposed on the optimal control policy. Combining these results, the value function of our FRT formulation serves as a CBF-like function, and conversely, any valid CBF is also a forward reachability value function inside the control invariant set, thereby revealing the inverse optimality of the CBF. This strong link we establish between the reachability problem and the barrier constraint, while guaranteeing the continuity of the value function, is not achievable by previous backward reachability-based formulations. As such, our work fills a crucial gap in the existing literature that is vital for constructing valid CBFs to ensure safety.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Scheduling for Solar-Powered Electric Vehicle Charging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of learning to charge Electric Vehicles (EVs) with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Traditional scheduling algorithms typically fail to balance near-optimal average performance with worst-case guarantees, particularly with OOD data. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is often too conservative and data-independent, whereas Reinforcement Learning (RL) tends to be overly aggressive and fully trusts the data, hindering their ability to consistently achieve the best-of-both-worlds. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel OOD-aware scheduling algorithm, denoted OOD-Charging. This algorithm employs a dynamic "awareness radius", which updates in real-time based on the Temporal Difference (TD)-error that reflects the severity of OOD. The OOD-Charging algorithm allows for a more effective balance between consistency and robustness in EV charging schedules, thereby significantly enhancing adaptability and efficiency in real-world charging environments. Our results demonstrate that this approach improves the scheduling reward reliably under real OOD scenarios with remarkable shifts of EV charging behaviors caused by COVID-19 in the Caltech ACN-Data.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel targeted exploration strategy for linear time-invariant systems without stochastic assumptions on the noise, i.e., without requiring independence or zero mean, allowing for deterministic model misspecifications. This work utilizes classical data-dependent uncertainty bounds on the least-squares parameter estimates in the presence of energy-bounded noise. We provide a sufficient condition on the exploration data that ensures a desired error bound on the estimated parameter. Using common approximations, we derive a semidefinite program to compute the optimal sinusoidal input excitation. Finally, we highlight the differences and commonalities between the developed non-stochastic targeted exploration strategy and conventional exploration strategies based on classical identification bounds through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>A Survey on IoT Ground Sensing Systems for Early Wildfire Detection: Technologies, Challenges and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The threat posed by wildfires or bushfires has become a severe global issue due to the increase in human activities in forested areas and the impact of climate change. Consequently, there is a surge in the development of automatic wildfire detection methods. Approaches based on long-distance imagery from satellites or watchtowers encounter limitations, such as restricted visibility, which results in delayed response times. To address and overcome these challenges, research interest has grown in the implementation of ground-based Internet of Things (IoT) sensing systems for early wildfire detection. However, research on energy consumption, detection latency, and detection accuracy of IoT sensing systems, as well as the performance of various anomaly detection algorithms when evaluated using these metrics, is lacking. Therefore, in this article, we present an overview of current IoT ground sensing systems for early wildfire detection. Camera and environmental sensing technologies suitable for early wildfire detection are discussed, as well as vision-based detection algorithms and detection algorithms for environmental sensing. Challenges related to the development and implementation of IoT ground sensing systems for early wildfire detection and the future research directions important for creating a robust detection system to combat the growing threat of wildfires worldwide are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The strategy of pre-training a large model on a diverse dataset, then fine-tuning for a particular application has yielded impressive results in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic control. This strategy has vast potential in adaptive control, where it is necessary to rapidly adapt to changing conditions with limited data. Toward concretely understanding the benefit of pre-training for adaptive control, we study the adaptive linear quadratic control problem in the setting where the learner has prior knowledge of a collection of basis matrices for the dynamics. This basis is misspecified in the sense that it cannot perfectly represent the dynamics of the underlying data generating process. We propose an algorithm that uses this prior knowledge, and prove upper bounds on the expected regret after $T$ interactions with the system. In the regime where $T$ is small, the upper bounds are dominated by a term that scales with either $\texttt{poly}(\log T)$ or $\sqrt{T}$, depending on the prior knowledge available to the learner. When $T$ is large, the regret is dominated by a term that grows with $\delta T$, where $\delta$ quantifies the level of misspecification. This linear term arises due to the inability to perfectly estimate the underlying dynamics using the misspecified basis, and is therefore unavoidable unless the basis matrices are also adapted online. However, it only dominates for large $T$, after the sublinear terms arising due to the error in estimating the weights for the basis matrices become negligible. We provide simulations that validate our analysis. Our simulations also show that offline data from a collection of related systems can be used as part of a pre-training stage to estimate a misspecified dynamics basis, which is in turn used by our adaptive controller.</description>

      <title>Power based adaptive compensator of output oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power-based output feedback compensator for oscillatory systems is proposed. The average input-output power of an oscillatory signal serves as an equivalent control effort, while the unknown amplitude and frequency of oscillations are detected at each half-period. This makes the compensator adaptive and discrete, while the measured oscillatory output is the single available signal in use. The resulting discrete control scheme enables a drastic reduction of communication efforts in the control loop. The compensator is designed for 2nd order systems, while an extension to higher-order dynamics, like e.g. in case of two-inertia systems, is also provided. Illustrative experimental case study of the 5th order oscillatory system is provided.</description>

      <title>A Review of the GIC Blocker Placement Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space weather poses a tremendous threat to power systems: geomagnetic disturbances could result in widespread disruptions and long-duration blackouts, including severe damage to system components. To mitigate their impacts, a handful of strategies exist, with the most promising being the deployment of transformer neutral blocking devices. The high cost of these devices, however, precludes their installation at all substations; this motivates the development of effective solutions for the cost-effective placement of such devices. While the current state-of-the-art in blocker placement methods is insufficient to be applied to real-sized power grids, ongoing research continues to increase the size of networks for which the placement problem remains tractable. Along these lines, the contributions of this paper are two fold: first, a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in blocker placement methods is provided; and second, a complete optimization formulation - implemented and benchmarked in an open-source software - for the blocker placement problem is presented.</description>

      <title>Enhance Low-Carbon Power System Operation via Carbon-Aware Demand Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the electrification process advances, enormous power flexibility is becoming available on the demand side, which can be harnessed to facilitate power system decarbonization. Hence, this paper studies the carbon-aware demand response (C-DR) paradigm, where individual users aim to minimize their carbon footprints through the optimal scheduling of flexible load devices. The specific operational dynamics and constraints of deferrable loads and thermostatically controlled loads are considered, and the carbon emission flow method is employed to determine users' carbon footprints using nodal carbon intensities. Then, an optimal power dispatch model that integrates the C-DR mechanism is proposed for low-carbon power system operation, based on the carbon-aware optimal power flow (C-OPF) method. Two solution algorithms, including a centralized Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation algorithm and an iterative solution algorithm, are developed to solve the bi-level power dispatch optimization model. Numerical simulations on the IEEE New England 39-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

Abstract: Contraction theory is a mathematical framework for studying the convergence, robustness, and modularity properties of dynamical systems and algorithms. In this opinion paper, we provide five main opinions on the virtues of contraction theory. These opinions are (i) contraction theory is a unifying framework emerging from classical and modern works, (ii) contractivity is computationally-friendly, robust, and modular stability, (iii) numerous dynamical systems are contracting, (iv) contraction theory is relevant to modern applications, and (v) contraction theory can be vastly extended in numerous directions. We survey recent theoretical and applied research in each of these five directions.</description>

Abstract: Supervising the safe operation of automated vehicles is a key requirement in order to unleash their full potential in future transportation systems. In particular, previous publications have argued that SAE Level 4 vehicles should be aware of their capabilities at runtime to make appropriate behavioral decisions. In this paper, we present a framework that enables the implementation of an online capability monitor. We derive a graphical system model that captures the relationships between the quality of system elements across different architectural views. In an expert-driven approach, we parameterize Bayesian Networks based on this structure using Fuzzy Logic. Using the online monitor, we infer the quality of the system's capabilities based on technical measurements acquired at runtime.</description>

      <title>Distributed Dissipativity-Based Controller and Topology Co-Design for DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed control approach for the voltage regulation problem in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs), loads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where the sets of DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the inputs and outputs of DGs and lines are connected with each other. Each subsystem has a local controller and a distributed global controller. To design these distributed controller gains, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and formulate a global linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of this distributed controller design, we use local controllers and formulate a set of local LMI problems. In contrast to existing DC MG control solutions that separate distributed controller and communication topology design problems, our approach proposes a framework for distributed controller and communication topology co-design. Our approach is also compositional, meaning that when a new subsystem is added to or taken away from a networked system, the new subsystem's local and global controllers can be designed based only on that subsystem's dynamics and the dissipativity information of the subsystems that are connected to it. This ensures that the overall system maintains stability and disturbance robustness during plug-and-play operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) for energy-efficient urban road driving for connected, automated vehicles. The proposed MPC aims to minimize total energy consumption by controlling the vehicle's longitudinal motion on roads with traffic lights and front vehicles. Its terminal cost function and terminal constraints are learned from data, which consists of the closed-loop state and input trajectories. The terminal cost function represents the remaining energy-to-spend starting from a given terminal state. The terminal constraints are designed to ensure that the controlled vehicle timely crosses the upcoming traffic light, adheres to traffic laws, and accounts for the front vehicles. We validate the effectiveness of our method through both simulations and vehicle-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating 19% improvement in average energy efficiency compared to conventional approaches that involve solving a long-horizon optimal control problem for speed planning and employing a separate controller for speed tracking.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Nonlinear Kalman Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shida-Jiang/A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in RF technologies, especially Internet of Things (IoT) devices, require compact and integrated RF circulators or transmit-receive (TR) switches for efficient resource use. Although conventional techniques are crucial in managing signal flow to prevent signal interference to sensitive receiver components, they have some drawbacks, such as limited isolation, low switching speed, complex circuitry, bulkiness, and high cost. This work presents a smart, miniaturized, nonlinear TR switch capable of operating over a wide frequency range (0.8 - 1.3 GHz), making it suitable for IoT frequency bands. The switch achieves high isolation, low insertion loss, and intelligent transitions between transmitter and receiver without requiring external control or bias pins.</description>

      <title>Multidirectional Pixelated Cubic Antenna with Enhanced Isolation for Vehicular Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a pixelated cubic antenna design with enhanced isolation and diverse radiation pattern for vehicular applications. The design consists of four radiating patches to take advantage of a nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern with enhanced isolation and high gain. The antenna system with four patches has been pixelated and optimized simultaneously to achieve desired performance and high isolation at 5.4 GHz band. The antenna achieved measured isolation of more than -34 dB between antenna elements. The overall isolation improvement obtained by the antenna is about 18 dB compared to a configuration using standard patch antennas. Moreover, isolation improvement is achieved through patch pixelization without additional resonators or elements. The antenna achieved up to 6.9 dB realized gain in each direction. Additionally, the cubic antenna system is equipped with an E-shaped GPS antenna to facilitate connectivity with GPS satellite. Finally, the antenna performance has been investigated using a simulation model of the vehicle roof and roof rack. The reflection coefficient, isolation and radiation patterns of the antenna remains unaffected. The antenna prototype has been fabricated on Rogers substrate and measured to verify the simulation results. The measured results correlate well with the simulation results. The proposed antenna features low-profile, simple design for ease of manufacture, good radiation characteristics with multidirectional property and high isolation, which are well-suited to vehicular applications in different environments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Gradient Descent with Varying Step Sizes using Integral Quadratic Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The framework of Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) is used to perform an analysis of gradient descent with varying step sizes. Two performance metrics are considered: convergence rate and noise amplification. We assume that the step size is produced from a line search and varies in a known interval. Modeling the algorithm as a linear, parameter-varying (LPV) system, we construct a parameterized linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition that certifies algorithm performance, which is solved using a result for polytopic LPV systems. Our results provide convergence rate guarantees when the step size lies within a restricted interval. Moreover, we recover existing rate bounds when this interval reduces to a single point, i.e. a constant step size. Finally, we note that the convergence rate depends only on the condition number of the problem. In contrast, the noise amplification performance depends on the individual values of the strong convexity and smoothness parameters, and varies inversely with them for a fixed condition number.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Audio Recommendations for the Long-Term: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel podcast recommender system deployed at industrial scale. This system successfully optimizes personal listening journeys that unfold over months for hundreds of millions of listeners. In deviating from the pervasive industry practice of optimizing machine learning algorithms for short-term proxy metrics, the system substantially improves long-term performance in A/B tests. The paper offers insights into how our methods cope with attribution, coordination, and measurement challenges that usually hinder such long-term optimization. To contextualize these practical insights within a broader academic framework, we turn to reinforcement learning (RL). Using the language of RL, we formulate a comprehensive model of users' recurring relationships with a recommender system. Then, within this model, we identify our approach as a policy improvement update to a component of the existing recommender system, enhanced by tailored modeling of value functions and user-state representations. Illustrative offline experiments suggest this specialized modeling reduces data requirements by as much as a factor of 120,000 compared to black-box approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17674v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convex hulls of reachable sets of nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances and uncertain initial conditions. Reachable sets play a critical role in control, but remain notoriously challenging to compute, and existing over-approximation tools tend to be conservative or computationally expensive. In this work, we characterize the convex hulls of reachable sets as the convex hulls of solutions of an ordinary differential equation with initial conditions on the sphere. This finite-dimensional characterization unlocks an efficient sampling-based estimation algorithm to accurately over-approximate reachable sets. We also study the structure of the boundary of the reachable convex hulls and derive error bounds for the estimation algorithm. We give applications to neural feedback loop analysis and robust MPC.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Convex Optimization: A Contraction and Equilibrium Tracking Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a novel and broadly-applicable contraction-theoretic approach to continuous-time time-varying convex optimization. For any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics, we show that the tracking error is asymptotically proportional to the rate of change of the parameter with proportionality constant upper bounded by Lipschitz constant in which the parameter appears divided by the contraction rate of the dynamics squared. We additionally establish that any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics can be augmented with a feedforward prediction term to ensure that the tracking error converges to zero exponentially quickly. To apply these results to time-varying convex optimization problems, we establish the strong infinitesimal contractivity of dynamics solving three canonical problems, namely monotone inclusions, linear equality-constrained problems, and composite minimization problems. For each of these problems, we prove the sharpest-known rates of contraction and provide explicit tracking error bounds between solution trajectories and minimizing trajectories. We validate our theoretical results on three numerical examples including an application to control-barrier function based controller design.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Linear Representation Learning from Non-IID Non-Isotropic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful concept behind much of the recent progress in machine learning is the extraction of common features across data from heterogeneous sources or tasks. Intuitively, using all of one's data to learn a common representation function benefits both computational effort and statistical generalization by leaving a smaller number of parameters to fine-tune on a given task. Toward theoretically grounding these merits, we propose a general setting of recovering linear operators $M$ from noisy vector measurements $y = Mx + w$, where the covariates $x$ may be both non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic. We demonstrate that existing isotropy-agnostic representation learning approaches incur biases on the representation update, which causes the scaling of the noise terms to lose favorable dependence on the number of source tasks. This in turn can cause the sample complexity of representation learning to be bottlenecked by the single-task data size. We introduce an adaptation, $\texttt{De-bias &amp; Feature-Whiten}$ ($\texttt{DFW}$), of the popular alternating minimization-descent scheme proposed independently in Collins et al., (2021) and Nayer and Vaswani (2022), and establish linear convergence to the optimal representation with noise level scaling down with the $\textit{total}$ source data size. This leads to generalization bounds on the same order as an oracle empirical risk minimizer. We verify the vital importance of $\texttt{DFW}$ on various numerical simulations. In particular, we show that vanilla alternating-minimization descent fails catastrophically even for iid, but mildly non-isotropic data. Our analysis unifies and generalizes prior work, and provides a flexible framework for a wider range of applications, such as in controls and dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: In system monitoring, automatic fault diagnosis seeks to infer the systems' state based on sensor readings, e.g., through machine learning models. In this context, it is of key importance that, based on historical data, these systems are able to generalize to incoming data. In parallel, many factors may induce changes in the data probability distribution, hindering the possibility of such models to generalize. In this sense, domain adaptation is an important framework for adapting models to different probability distributions. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark, based on the Tennessee Eastman Process of Downs and Vogel (1993), for benchmarking domain adaptation methods in the context of chemical processes. Besides describing the process, and its relevance for domain adaptation, we describe a series of data processing steps for reproducing our benchmark. We then test 11 domain adaptation strategies on this novel benchmark, showing that optimal transport-based techniques outperform other strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Enhanced Service Ecosystem for Simulation in Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10623</link>

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML), taken individually or combined into quantum-assisted ML (QML), are ascending computing paradigms whose calculations come with huge potential for speedup, increase in precision, and resource reductions. Likely improvements for numerical simulations in engineering imply the possibility of a strong economic impact on the manufacturing industry. In this project report, we propose a framework for a quantum computing-enhanced service ecosystem for simulation in manufacturing, consisting of various layers ranging from hardware to algorithms to service and organizational layers. In addition, we give insight into the current state of the art of applications research based on QC and QML, both from a scientific and an industrial point of view. We further analyse two high-value use cases with the aim of a quantitative evaluation of these new computing paradigms for industrially-relevant settings.</description>

      <title>Explainable Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems via Causal Discovery from Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09871v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online unsupervised detection of anomalies is crucial to guarantee the correct operation of cyber-physical systems and the safety of humans interacting with them. State-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning via neural networks achieve outstanding performance at anomaly recognition, evaluating the discrepancy between a normal model of the system (with no anomalies) and the real-time stream of sensor time series. However, large training data and time are typically required, and explainability is still a challenge to identify the root of the anomaly and implement predictive maintainance. In this paper, we use causal discovery to learn a normal causal graph of the system, and we evaluate the persistency of causal links during real-time acquisition of sensor data to promptly detect anomalies. On two benchmark anomaly detection datasets, we show that our method has higher training efficiency, outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures and correctly identifies the sources of &gt;10 different anomalies.

      <title>Conformal Prediction of Motion Control Performance for an Automated Vehicle in Presence of Actuator Degradations and Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated driving systems require monitoring mechanisms to ensure safe operation, especially if system components degrade or fail. Their runtime self-representation plays a key role as it provides a-priori knowledge about the system's capabilities and limitations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for deriving such a self-representation model for the motion controller of an automated vehicle. A conformalized prediction model is learned and allows estimating how operational conditions as well as potential degradations and failures of the vehicle's actuators impact motion control performance. During runtime behavior generation, our predictor can provide a heuristic for determining the admissible action space.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis of Multi-task Representation Learning for Linear-Quadratic Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning is a powerful tool that enables learning over large multitudes of agents or domains by enforcing that all agents operate on a shared set of learned features. However, many robotics or controls applications that would benefit from collaboration operate in settings with changing environments and goals, whereas most guarantees for representation learning are stated for static settings. Toward rigorously establishing the benefit of representation learning in dynamic settings, we analyze the regret of multi-task representation learning for linear-quadratic control. This setting introduces unique challenges. Firstly, we must account for and balance the $\textit{misspecification}$ introduced by an approximate representation. Secondly, we cannot rely on the parameter update schemes of single-task online LQR, for which least-squares often suffices, and must devise a novel scheme to ensure sufficient improvement. We demonstrate that for settings where exploration is "benign", the regret of any agent after $T$ timesteps scales as $\tilde O(\sqrt{T/H})$, where $H$ is the number of agents. In settings with "difficult" exploration, the regret scales as $\tilde O(\sqrt{d_u d_\theta} \sqrt{T} + T^{3/4}/H^{1/5})$, where $d_x$ is the state-space dimension, $d_u$ is the input dimension, and $d_\theta$ is the task-specific parameter count. In both cases, by comparing to the minimax single-task regret $O(\sqrt{d_x d_u^2}\sqrt{T})$, we see a benefit of a large number of agents. Notably, in the difficult exploration case, by sharing a representation across tasks, the effective task-specific parameter count can often be small $d_\theta &lt; d_x d_u$. Lastly, we provide numerical validation of the trends we predict.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Clutched-Elastic Robots: A Contact-Implicit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intrinsically elastic robots surpass their rigid counterparts in a range of different characteristics. By temporarily storing potential energy and subsequently converting it to kinetic energy, elastic robots are capable of highly dynamic motions even with limited motor power. However, the time-dependency of this energy storage and release mechanism remains one of the major challenges in controlling elastic robots. A possible remedy is the introduction of locking elements (i.e. clutches and brakes) in the drive train. This gives rise to a new class of robots, so-called clutched-elastic robots (CER), with which it is possible to precisely control the energy-transfer timing. A prevalent challenge in the realm of CERs is the automatic discovery of clutch sequences. Due to complexity, many methods still rely on pre-defined modes. In this paper, we introduce a novel contact-implicit scheme designed to optimize both control input and clutch sequence simultaneously. A penalty in the objective function ensures the prevention of unnecessary clutch transitions. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a double pendulum equipped with two of our newly proposed clutch-based Bi-Stiffness Actuators (BSA).</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Outlier Accommodation for Tightly Coupled RTK-Aided Inertial Navigation Systems in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13912</link>

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a fundamental approach for attaining continuously available absolute vehicle position and full state estimates at high bandwidth. For transportation applications, stated accuracy specifications must be achieved, unless the navigation system can detect when it is violated. In urban environments, GNSS measurements are susceptible to outliers, which motivates the important problem of accommodating outliers while either achieving a performance specification or communicating that it is not feasible. Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) is designed to optimally select measurements to address this problem. Existing RAPS approaches lack a method applicable to carrier phase measurements, which have the benefit of measurement errors at the centimeter level along with the challenge of being biased by integer ambiguities. This paper proposes a RAPS framework that combines Real-time Kinematic (RTK) in a tightly coupled INS for urban navigation applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this RAPS-INS-RTK framework, achieving 85.84% and 92.07% of horizontal and vertical errors less than 1.5 meters and 3 meters, respectively, using a smartphone-grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) from a deep-urban dataset. This performance not only surpasses the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) requirements, but also shows a 10% improvement compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Computing an Aircraft's Gliding Range and Minimal Return Altitude in Presence of Obstacles and Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the event of a total loss of thrust, a pilot must identify a reachable landing site and subsequently execute a forced landing. To do so, they must estimate which region on the ground can be reached safely in gliding flight. We call this the gliding reachable region (GRR). To compute the GRR, we employ an optimal control formulation aiming to reach a point in space while minimizing altitude loss. A simplified model of the aircraft's dynamics is used, where the effect of turns is neglected. The resulting equations are discretized on a grid and solved numerically. Our algorithm for computing the GRR is fast enough to run in real time during flight, it accounts for ground obstacles and wind, and for each point in the GRR it outputs the path to reach it with minimal loss of altitude.
  A related problem is estimating the minimal altitude an aircraft needs in order to glide to a given airfield in the presence of obstacles. This information enables pilots to plan routes that always have an airport within gliding distance. We formalize this problem using an optimal control formulation based on the same aircraft dynamics model. The resulting equations are solved with a second algorithm that outputs the minimal re-entry altitude and the paths to reach the airfield from any position while avoiding obstacles.
  The algorithms we develop are based on the Ordered Upwind Method and the Fast Marching Method.</description>
