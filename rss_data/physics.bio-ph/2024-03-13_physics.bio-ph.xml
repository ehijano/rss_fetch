      <title>Towards a Bayesian mechanics of metacognitive particles: A commentary on "Path integrals, particular kinds, and strange things" by Friston, Da Costa, Sakthivadivel, Heins, Pavliotis, Ramstead, and Parr</title>

Abstract: What could metacognition look like in simple physical terms? We define metacognition as having beliefs about beliefs, which can be articulated very simply using the language of statistical physics and Bayesian mechanics. We introduce a typology between cognitive and metacognitive particles and develop an example of a metacognitive particle. This can be generalized to provide examples of higher forms of metacognition: i.e. particles having beliefs about beliefs about beliefs and so forth. We conclude by saying that the typology of particles laid down in the target article seems promising, for seemingly enabling a physics of cognition that builds upon and refines the free energy principle, toward a physical description of entities that specifically possess higher forms of cognition.</description>

      <title>Surface activation of Hastalex by vacuum argon plasma for cytocompatibility enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we present surface analysis and biocompatibility evaluation of novel composite material based on graphene oxide traded as Hastalex. First, the surface morphology and elemental analysis of the pristine material were examined by atomic force and scanning electron microscopies, and by energy-dispersive and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, respectively. The Hastalex surface was then modified by plasma, 3 and 8 W with exposure times up to 240 s, the impact of which on the material surface wettability and morphology was further evaluated. In addition, the material aging was studied at room and elevated temperatures. Significant changes in surface roughness, morphology, and area were detected at the nanometre scale after plasma exposure. An increase in oxygen content due to the plasma exposure was observed both for 3 and 8 W. The plasma treatment had an outstanding effect on the cytocompatibility of Hastalex foil treated at both input powers of 3 and 8 W. The cell number of human MRC 5 fibroblasts on Hastalex foils exposed to plasma increased significantly compared to pristine Hastalex and even to tissue culture polystyrene. The plasma exposure also affected the fibroblasts cell growth and shape.</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular automaton model with heterogeneous cell sizes predicts epithelial colony growth</title>

Abstract: Regulation of cell proliferation is a crucial aspect of tissue development and homeostasis and plays a major role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor invasion. A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which describes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual cell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many physiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of contact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance of cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is still debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as numerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell ensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact inhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a minimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by extending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells during growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous in-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a systematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell dynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of emergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective cell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the transition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent regime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the volume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only inter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a size-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed contact inhibition.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs and thermodynamics of energy-relay proofreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological processes that are able to discriminate between different molecules consume energy and dissipate heat. They operate at different levels of fidelity and speed, and as a consequence there exist fundamental trade-offs between these quantities and the entropy production rate. Usually, the energy source required to operate in a high-fidelity regime comes from the consumption of external energetic molecules, e.g., GTP hydrolysis in protein translation . In this work, we study trade-offs between several kinetic and thermodynamic observables for Hopfield's energy-relay mechanism, which does not consume external molecules and is able to operate in depleted regions, at the cost of a higher error rate. The trade-offs are obtained both analytically and numerically via Pareto optimal fronts. We find that the scheme is able to operate in three distinct regimes: an energy relay regime, a mixed relay-Michaelis-Menten regime, and a Michaelis-Menten regime, depending on the kinetic and energetic parameters that tune transitions between states. The mixed regime features a dynamical phase transition in the error-entropy production Pareto trade-off, while the pure energy relay regime contains a region where this type of proofreading energetically outperforms standard kinetic proofreading.</description>

      <title>NPCoronaPredict: A computational pipeline for the prediction of the nanoparticle-biomolecule corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The corona of a nanoparticle immersed in a biological fluid is of key importance to its eventual fate and bioactivity in the environment or inside live tissues. It is critical to have insight into both the underlying bionano interactions and the corona composition to ensure biocompatibility of novel engineered nanomaterials. A prediction of these properties in silico requires the successful spanning of multiple orders of magnitude of both time and physical dimensions to produce results in a reasonable amount of time, necessitating the development of a multiscale modelling approach. Here, we present the NPCoronaPredict open-source software package: a suite of software tools to enable this prediction for complex multi-component nanomaterials in essentially arbitrary biological fluids, or more generally any medium containing organic molecules. The package integrates several recent physics-based computational models and a library of both physics-based and data-driven parameterisations for nanomaterials and organic molecules. We describe the underlying theoretical background and the package functionality from the design of multi-component NPs through to the evaluation of the corona.</description>

      <title>Universal bounds on optimization of free energy harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04975v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harvesting free energy from the environment is essential for the operation of many biological and artificial systems. We investigate the maximum rate of harvesting achievable by optimizing a set of reactions in a Markovian system, possibly given topological, kinetic, and thermodynamic constraints. We show that the maximum harvesting rate can be expressed as a variational principle, which we solve in closed-form for three physically meaningful regimes. Our approach is relevant for optimal design and for quantifying efficiency of existing reactions. Our results are illustrated on bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump from Archae, which is found to be close to optimal under realistic conditions.</description>
