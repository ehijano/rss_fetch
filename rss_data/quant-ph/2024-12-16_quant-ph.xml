      <title>Experimental implementation of dimension-dependent contextuality inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a derivation and experimental implementation of a dimension-dependent contextuality inequality to certify both the quantumness and dimensionality of a given system. Existing methods for certification of the dimension of quantum system can be cheated by using larger classical systems, creating a potential loophole in these benchmarks. Our approach uses contextuality inequalities that cannot be violated by classical systems thus closing the previous loophole. We validate this framework experimentally with photons, observing violations of a CHSH-based contextuality inequality and surpassing the qutrit bound of the CGLMP4-based contextuality inequality. These show that contextuality can be used for noise-robust tests of the number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Observation as Physication. A single-world unitary no-conspiracy interpretation of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical meaning of the operators is not reducible to the intrinsic relations of the quantum system, since unitary transformations can find other operators satisfying the exact same relations. The physical meaning is determined empirically. I propose that the assignment of physical meaning to operators spreads through observation, along with the values of the observables, from the already observed degrees of freedom to the newly observed ones. I call this process "physication". I propose that quantum observations are nothing more than this assignment, which can be done unitarily. This approach doesn't require collapse, many-worlds, or a conspiratorial fine tuning of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pushforward Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designs, structures connected to averaging with respect to a given measure using finite sets of points, have proven themselves as invaluable tools across the field of quantum information, finding their uses in state and process tomography, key distribution and others. In this work, we introduce a new concept of pushforward designs, which allows us to obtain new structures from already existing ones by mapping them between the spaces, with specific examples including simplex designs and mixed state designs from complex projective designs. Based on the general concept, we put forward a structure called channel $[t,k]$-design, allowing for averaging over space of quantum channels for systems in contact with an environment of dimension $k$. Based on this notion, we introduce the concept of effective environment dimensionality $k^*$, which we estimate for the IBM Kyoto quantum computer to be below $2.2$ for times up to $350\mu\text{s}$.</description>

      <title>Loss-tolerant quantum key distribution with detection efficiency mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) typically rely on prepare-and-measure (P&amp;M) schemes. Unfortunately, these implementations are not completely secure, unless security proofs fully incorporate all imperfections of real devices. So far, existing proofs have primarily focused on imperfections of either the light source or the measurement device. In this paper, we establish a security proof for the loss-tolerant P&amp;M QKD protocol that incorporates imperfections in both the source and the detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate the security of this scheme when the emitted states deviate from the ideal ones and Bob's measurement device does not meet the basis-independent detection efficiency condition. Furthermore, we conduct an experiment to characterise the detection efficiency mismatch of commercial single-photon detectors as a function of the polarisation state of the input light, and determine the expected secret key rate in the presence of state preparation flaws when using such detectors. Our work provides a way towards guaranteeing the security of actual implementations of widely deployed P&amp;M QKD.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Amplitude Patterns via Nested Quantum Affine Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a robust and scalable framework for implementing nested affine transformations in quantum circuits. Utilizing Hadamard-supported conditional initialization and block encoding, the proposed method systematically applies sequential affine transformations while preserving state normalization. This approach provides an effective method for generating combinatorial amplitude patterns within quantum states with demonstrated applications in combinatorics and signal processing. The utility of the framework is exemplified through two key applications: financial risk assessment, where it efficiently computes portfolio returns using combinatorial sum of amplitudes, and discrete signal processing, where it enables precise manipulation of Fourier coefficients for enhanced signal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Gaussian genuine entanglement witnesses with modern software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable Gaussian entanglement is an attractive notion, both as a fundamental concept in quantum information theory, based on the well-established Gaussian formalism for phase-space variables, and as a practical resource in quantum technology, exploiting in particular, unconditional room-temperature squeezed-light quantum optics. The readily available high level of scalability, however, is accompanied by an increased theoretical complexity when the multipartite entanglement of a growing number of optical modes is considered. For such systems, we present several approaches to reconstruct the most probable physical covariance matrix from a measured non-physical one and then test the reconstructed matrix for different kinds of separability (factorizability, concrete partite separability or biseparability) even in the presence of measurement errors. All these approaches are based on formulating the desired properties (physicality or separability) as convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved with modern optimization solvers, even when the system grows. To every optimization problem we construct the corresponding dual problem used to verify the optimality of the solution. Besides this numerical part of work, we derive an explicit analytical expression for the symplectic trace of a positive definite matrix, which can serve as a simple witness of an entanglement witness, and extend it for positive semidefinite matrices. In addition, we show that in some cases our optimization problems can be solved analytically.</description>

      <title>Synthetic multi-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm cages in Fock state lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09766v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fock-state lattices (FSLs), composed of photon number states with infinite Hilbert space, have emerged as a promising platform for simulating high-dimensional physics due to their potential to extend into arbitrarily high dimensions. Here, we demonstrate the construction of multi-dimensional FSLs using superconducting quantum circuits. By controlling artificial gauge fields within their internal structures, we investigate flux-induced extreme localization dynamics, such as Aharonov-Bohm caging, extending from 2D to 3D. We also explore the coherent interference of quantum superposition states, achieving extreme localization within specific subspaces assisted by quantum entanglement. Our findings pave the way for manipulating the behavior of a broad class of quantum states in higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal transfer of high-dimensional unitary operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly correlated biphoton states are powerful resources in quantum optics, both for fundamental tests of the theory and practical applications. In particular, high-dimensional spatial correlation has been used in several quantum information processing and sensing tasks, for instance, in ghost imaging experiments along with several quantum key distribution protocols. Here, we introduce a technique that exploits spatial correlations, whereby one can nonlocally access the result of an arbitrary unitary operator on an arbitrary input state without the need to perform any operation themselves. The method is experimentally validated on a set of spatially periodic unitary operations in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces. Our findings pave the way for efficiently distributing quantum simulations and computations in future instances of quantum networks where users with limited resources can nonlocally access the results of complex unitary transformations via a centrally located quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Programmable simulation of high-order exceptional point with a trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nontrivial degeneracies in non-Hermitian systems, exceptional points (EPs), have attracted extensive attention due to intriguing phenomena. Compared with commonly observed second-order EPs, high-order EPs show rich physics due to their extended dimension and parameter space, ranging from the coalescence of EPs into higher order to potential applications in topological properties. However, these features also pose challenges in controlling multiple coherent and dissipative elements in a scaled system. Here we experimentally demonstrate a native programmable control to simulate a high-order non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in a multi-dimensional trapped ion system. We simulate a series of non-Hermitian systems with varied parameters and observe the coalescence of second-order EPs into a fourth-order EP. Our results pave the way for scalable quantum simulation of high-dimensional dissipative systems and can be beneficial for the application of high-order EPs in quantum sensing and quantum control.</description>

      <title>A 3D lattice defect and efficient computations in topological MBQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an efficient, fully fault-tolerant implementation of Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) in the 3D cluster state. The two key novelties are (i) the introduction of a lattice defect in the underlying cluster state and (ii) the use of the Rudolph-Grover rebit encoding. Concretely, (i) allows for a topological implementation of the Hadamard gate, while (ii) does the same for the phase gate. Furthermore, we develop general ideas towards circuit compaction and algorithmic circuit verification, which we implement for the Reed-Muller code used for magic state distillation. Our performance analysis highlights the overall improvements provided by the new methods.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Tunnel Diode Oscillator for Qubit Readout Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a tunnel diode oscillator and characterized its performance, highlighting its potential applications in the quantum state readout of electrons insemiconductors and electrons on liquid helium. This cryogenic microwave source demonstrates significant scalability potential for large-scale qubit readout systems due to its compact design and low power consumption of only 1 uW, making it suitable for integration on the 10 mK stage of a dilution refrigerator. The tunnel diode oscillator exhibits superior amplitude stability compared to commercial microwave sources. The output frequency is centered around 140 MHz, commonly used for qubit readout of electrons in semiconductors, with a frequency tunability of 20 MHz achieved using a varactor diode. Furthermore, the phase noise was significantly improved by replacing the commercially available voltage source with a lead-acid battery, achieving a measured phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging with X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging encompasses a broad range of methods that exploit the quantum properties of light to capture information about an object. One such approach involves using a two-photon quantum state, where only one photon interacts with the object being imaged while its entangled partner carries spatial or temporal information. To implement this technique, it is necessary to generate specific quantum states of light and detect photons at the single-photon level. While this method has been successfully demonstrated in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, extending it to X-rays has faced significant challenges due to the difficulties in producing a sufficient rate of X-ray photon pairs and detecting them with adequate resolution. Here, we demonstrate record high rates of correlated X-ray photon pairs produced via a spontaneous parametric down-conversion process and we employ these photons to perform quantum correlation imaging of several objects, including a biological sample (E. cardamomum seedpod). Notably, we report an unprecedented detection rate of about 6,300 pairs per hour and the observation of energy anti-correlation for the X-ray photon pairs. We also present a detailed analysis of the properties of the down-converted X-ray photons, as well as a comprehensive study of the correlation imaging formation, including a study of distortions and corrections. These results mark a substantial advancement in X-ray quantum imaging, expanding the possibilities of X-ray quantum optical technologies, and illustrating the pathway towards enhancing biological imaging with reduced radiation doses.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong photon superbunching from electron shelving and time integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon correlation is at the heart of quantum optics and has important applications in quantum technologies. Here we propose a universally applicable mechanism that can generate the superbunching light with ultrastrong second-order and higher-order correlations hitherto unreachable. This mechanism arises from the combined effect of electron shelving and time integral of fluorescence based on a cascaded quantum system comprising an emitter and a filter or a cavity QED system, and has high experimental feasibility according to current experimental techniques. Besides, both the correlation degrees and the frequency of the light can be flexibly varied over broad ranges. Both the research and technological applications on strong correlations can be extensively facilitated due to this readily accessible and manipulated mechanism for generating photon correlation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the matrix product formalism, we have studied the variation of entanglement and fidelity measures in the MP ground states of a generic anisotropic spin 2 chain with nearest neighbour interactions and shared symmetries. These MP states represent the exact Ground State solutions of the system and display distinctive characteristics determined by a maximum of three parameters exhibiting one antiferromagnetic Haldane phase (AFMH), together with a secondary weak antiferromagnetic (WAFM) and a weak ferromagnetic phase (WFM). Using Transfer Matrix Method (TM), we have obtained nontrivial features in the variation of Quantum Correlation measures and QIT Measures around the VBS point for an acritical choice of the parameters, and a Quantum Critical Point, for a critical choice of the parameters, of the AFMH spin liquid phase of the system.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Deterministic steady-state subradiance within a single-excitation basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subradiance shows promising applications in quantum information, yet its realization remains more challenging than superradiance due to the need to suppress various decay channels. This study introduces a state space within a single-excitation basis with perfect subradiance and genuine multipartite quantum entanglement resources for the all-to-all case. Utilizing the quantum jump operator method, we also provide an analytical derivation of the system's steady final state for any single-excitation initial state. Additionally, we determine the approximate final state in the quasi-all-to-all coupling scenario. As an illustrative example, we evaluate the coupling and dynamical properties of emitters in a photonic crystal slab possessing an ultra-high quality bound state in the continuum, thereby validating the efficacy of our theoretical approach. This theoretical framework facilitates the analytical prediction of dynamics for long-lived multipartite entanglement while elucidating a pathway toward realizing autonomous subradiance in atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis of different photon-mediated entanglement generation schemes under optical dephasing and spectral diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters, such as quantum dots, color centers, rare-earth dopants, and organic molecules, offer qubit systems that integrate well with chip-scale photonic and electronic devices. To fully harness their potential for quantum applications requires the generation of entanglement between two remote qubits with high fidelity and efficiency. In this article, we compare the performance of three common photon-mediated entanglement schemes under realistic noise for solid-state quantum emitters, including optical dephasing and spectral diffusion. We identify the optimal scheme across different noise regimes and calculate the measurement parameters needed to achieve the highest entanglement fidelity at a given rate. Additionally, we explore the effects of temporal and spectral filtering in enhancing entanglement fidelity. Our findings provide practical guidelines for selecting optimal entanglement schemes and outline the measurement strategies for achieving better entanglement fidelity.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-induced Quantum Homogenization for Temporal Information Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoirs have great potential as they utilize the complex real-time dissipative dynamics of quantum systems for information processing and target time-series generation without precise control or fine-tuning of the Hamiltonian parameters. Nonetheless, their realization is challenging as quantum hardware with appropriate dynamics, robustness to noise, and ability to produce target steady states is required. To that end, we propose the disordered quantum homogenizer as an alternative platform, and prove it satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions -- \textit{stability} and \textit{contractivity} -- of the reservoir dynamics, necessary for solving machine learning tasks with time-series input data streams. The results indicate that the quantum homogenization protocol, physically implementable as either nuclear magnetic resonance ensemble or a photonic system, can potentially function as a reservoir computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states featuring extensive multipartite entanglement are a resource for quantum-enhanced metrology, with sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. However, robust generation of these states using unitary dynamics typically requires all-to-all interactions among particles. Here, we demonstrate that optimal states for quantum sensing can be generated with sparse interaction graphs featuring only a logarithmic number of couplings per particle. We show that specific sparse graphs with long-range interactions can approximate the dynamics of all-to-all spin models, such as the one-axis twisting model, even for large system sizes. The resulting sparse coupling graphs and protocol can also be efficiently implemented using dynamic reconfiguration of atoms in optical tweezers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rayleigh's criterion infamously imposes a minimum separation between two incoherent sources for them to be distinguishable via classical methods. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of two-photon beats from the interference of a single reference photon and a photon coming from one of two transversally displaced incoherent sources. We also show that, apart from a factor of two, the ultimate quantum precision in the estimation of any value of the distance between two thermal sources is achievable independently of the wavepacket spatial structure, by performing a relatively low number of sampling measurements of the transverse momenta of the interfering photons, without the need of any additional optics. The feasibility of this technique makes it an optimal candidate to important applications in microscopy, astronomy and remote sensing</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schmidt number characterizes the quantum entanglement of a bipartite mixed state and plays a significant role in certifying entanglement of quantum states. We derive a Schmidt number criterion based on the trace norm of the correlation matrix obtained from the general symmetric informationally complete measurements. The criterion gives an effective way to quantify the entanglement dimension of a bipartite state with arbitrary local dimensions. We show that this Schmidt number criterion is more effective and superior than other criteria such as fidelity, CCNR (computable cross-norm or realignment), MUB (mutually unbiased bases) and EAM (equiangular measurements) criteria in certifying the Schmidt numbers by detailed examples.</description>

      <title>Exploration of optimal hyperfine transitions for spin-wave storage in $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependence of the magnetic fluctuations and the spin coherence time $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ of the lowest Stark states $^4I_{15/2}\ (Z_1)$ in $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ under zero magnetic field on Er concentration is numerically investigated in the range of 10 to 10$^6$ parts per million (ppm). The magnetic fluctuations surrounding the target Er electron generated by the dipole-dipole interaction due to two components, Y ions in host crystal and doped Er ions, are calculated by Monte-Carlo method. The former magnetic fluctuation is constant, while the latter depends on Er concentration. Due to these two components, the Er-concentration dependence of $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ at the zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) points saturates for crystals with Er concentration below 10 ppm and no extension of the $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ is expected without an external magnetic field. Under a magnetic field, the longest $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ at a particular ZEFOZ point is expected to be over 150 s (90 s) for site 1 (site 2), which is $\sim 10^5$ times longer than that at zero field for 10-ppm $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$. Interestingly, the ZEFOZ points under a magnetic field appear almost along the one direction for site 1 and almost in one plane for site 2 in optical frame $(D_1, D_2, b)$. The experiment favors this trend in the position of the ZEFOZ points which can be explained on the basis of the anisotropy of the effective spin Hamiltonian parameters. Finally, the tolerance of the ZEFOZ point at each site with the longest $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ against the errors in the applied magnetic field vector is evaluated numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of interfaces are key to understand the physics of matter. However, the study of quantum interface dynamics has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we use large-scale Tree Tensor Network simulations to identify the dynamical signature of an interface roughening transition within the ferromagnetic phase of the 2D quantum Ising model. For initial domain wall profiles we find extended prethermal plateaus for smooth interfaces, whereas above the roughening transition the domain wall decays quickly. Our results can be readily explored experimentally in Rydberg atomic systems.</description>

      <title>A Non-Convex Optimization Strategy for Computing Convex-Roof Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a numerical methodology for the computation of entanglement measures for mixed quantum states. Using the well-known Schr\"odinger-HJW theorem, the computation of convex roof entanglement measures is reframed as a search for unitary matrices; a nonconvex optimization problem. To address this non-convexity, we modify a genetic algorithm, known in the literature as differential evolution, constraining the search space to unitary matrices by using a QR factorization. We then refine results using a quasi-Newton method. We benchmark our method on simple test problems and, as an application, compute entanglement between a system and its environment over time for pure dephasing evolutions. We also study the temperature dependence of Gibbs state entanglement for a class of block-diagonal Hamiltonians to provide a complementary test scenario with a set of entangled states that are qualitatively different. We find that the method works well enough to reliably reproduce entanglement curves, even for comparatively large systems. To our knowledge, the modified genetic algorithm represents the first derivative-free and non-convex computational method that broadly applies to the computation of convex roof entanglement measures.</description>

      <title>Seeking the Casimir Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its first description in 1948, the Casimir effect has been studied extensively. Standard arguments for its existence hinge on the elimination of certain modes of the electromagnetic field because of the boundary conditions in the Casimir cavity. As such, it has been suggested that the ground state energy of the vacuum within the cavity may be reduced compared to the value outside. Could this have an effect on physical phenomena within the cavity? We study this Casimir energy and probe whether the critical temperature $T_c$ of a superconductor is altered when it is placed in the cavity. We do not detect any change in $T_c$ larger than 12 microKelvin, but theoretically expect a change on the order of 0.025 microKelvin, roughly 1000 times lower than our achieved sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamics from minimising dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the same physical system can be described by different effective theories depending on the scale at which it is observed. In this work, we formulate a prescription for finding the unitary that best approximates the large scale dynamics of a quantum system evolving discretely in time, as it is the case for digital quantum simulators. We consider the situation in which the degrees of freedom of the system can be divided between an IR part that we can observe, and a UV part that we cannot observe. Following a principle of minimal dissipation, our goal is to find the unitary dynamics that best approximates the (generally non unitary) time evolution of the IR degrees of freedom. We first prove that when the IR and UV degrees of freedom are weakly coupled, the unitary that maximises the fidelity is given by a mean-field dynamics and the error is given by a sum of energy variances. We then apply our results to a one dimensional quantum walk, which is known to reproduce the Dirac equation in the small mass and momenta limit. We find that in this limit the effective IR dynamics is obtained by a mass redefinition.</description>

      <title>Non-Local to Local Eigenbasis Permutations of Pauli Product Diagonal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of mapping non-local, sparse, diagonal forms of quantum Hamiltonians to local forms via eigenbasis permutations. We prove that such a mapping is not always possible, definitively refuting the "Quasiparticle Locality Conjecture." This refutation is achieved by establishing a lower bound, denoted $G_m$, on the number of non-zero terms in a localized diagonal form. Remarkably, $G_m$ reaches cosmologically large values, comparable to the entropy of the observable universe for certain localities $m$. While this theoretically guarantees the conjecture's falsity, the immense scale of $G_m$ motivates us to explore the implications for practically sized systems through a probabilistic approach. We construct a set of random, non-local, sparse, diagonal forms and hypothesize their probability of finding a local representation. Our hypothesize suggests a sharp transition in this probability, linked to the Hamiltonian's sparsity relative to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of neutron stars to black holes transition. This observation hints at a potential connection between Hamiltonian sparsity, localizability, critical phenomena warranting further investigation into their interplay in both theoretical and astrophysical contexts.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and a novel quantity assessing their interplay - called anti-flatness, after a quantum quench of a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration and magic spreading under ergodic quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state complexity metrics, such as anticoncentration and magic, offer key insights into many-body physics, information scrambling, and quantum computing. Anticoncentration and equilibration of magic under dynamics of random quantum circuits occur at times scaling logarithmically with system size, a prediction that is believed to extend to more general ergodic dynamics. This work challenges this idea by examining the anticoncentration and magic spreading in one-dimensional ergodic Floquet models and Hamiltonian systems. Using participation and stabilizer entropies to probe these resources, we reveal significant differences between the two settings.Floquet systems align with random circuit predictions, exhibiting anticoncentration and saturation of magic at time scales that increase logarithmically with system size. In contrast, Hamiltonian dynamics deviate from the random circuit predictions and require times scaling approximately linearly with system size to achieve saturation of participation and stabilizer entropies, which remain smaller than that of the typical quantum states even in the long-time limit. Our findings establish the phenomenology of participation and entropy growth in ergodic many-body systems and emphasize the role of energy conservation in constraining anticoncentration and magic dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Significance of Intermediate Latents: Distinguishing Quantum Causal Scenarios with Indistinguishable Classical Analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of graphical models to represent causal hypotheses has enabled revolutionary progress in the study of the foundations of quantum theory. Here we consider directed acyclic graphs each of which contains both nodes representing observed variables as well as nodes representing latent or hidden variables. When comparing distinct causal structure, a natural question to ask is if they can explain distinct sets of observable distributions or not. Statisticians have developed a great variety of tools for resolving such questions under the assumption that latent nodes be interpreted classically. Here we highlight how the change to a quantum interpretation of the latent nodes induces distinctions between causal scenarios that would be classically indistinguishable. We especially concentrate on quantum scenarios containing latent nodes with at least one latent parent, a.k.a. possessing intermediate latents. This initial survey demonstrates that many such quantum processes can be operationally distinguished by considerations related to monogamy of nonlocality, especially when computationally aided by a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations which we tailor for the study such scenarios. We conclude by clarifying the challenges that prevent the generalization of this work, calling attention to open problems regarding observational (in)equivalence of quantum causal structures with intermediate latents.</description>

      <title>SymPT: a comprehensive tool for automating effective Hamiltonian derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) is a foundational perturbative method for deriving effective Hamiltonians in quantum systems by systematically eliminating couplings between pairs of energy distant subspaces. Despite recent advancements, the implementation of SWTs for sufficiently complex systems remains computationally challenging and often requires extensive calculations that are prone to errors. In this work, we introduce an analytical software tool, SymPT (Symbolic Perturbation Theory), designed to automate the SWT and its extensions. Building on a universal framework developed in recent research, SymPT provides a systematic and generalizable solution for deriving the generator of the transformation, enabling accurate computation of effective Hamiltonians for arbitrary perturbative systems. The tool supports both time-independent and time-periodic Hamiltonians, extending beyond standard SWT to incorporate arbitrary coupling elimination, block-diagonalization and full-diagonalization routines, thus enabling precise handling of systems with intricate energy structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that perfect revivals of Rabi oscillations are possible, under certain conditions, in the population inversion of a trapped ion. Based on this property, we find that Schr\"odinger cat states of the atomic motion are naturally generated by the unitary dynamics. Using a pair of symmetric and antisymmetric Schr\"odinger cat states of the motion, together with an electronic excited or ground state, we find that the interaction leads to four orthonormal maximally entangled states of the two partitions, which we identify as Bell states.

      <title>Evaluation of quantum key distribution systems against injection-locking attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ideal quantum key distribution (QKD) systems are well-understood, practical implementations face various vulnerabilities, such as side-channel attacks resulting from device imperfections. Current security proofs for decoy-state BB84 protocols either assume uniform phase randomization of Alice's signals, which is compromised by practical limitations and attacks like injection locking, or rely on a (partially) characterized phase distribution. This work presents an experimental method to characterize the phase de-randomization from injection locking using a heterodyne detection setup, providing a lower bound on the degree of isolation required to protect QKD transmitters against injection-locking attacks. The methods presented are source-agnostic and can be used to evaluate general QKD systems against injection-locking attacks.</description>

      <title>Exchange-Symmetrized Qudit Bell Bases and Bell-State Distinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement of qudit pairs, with single particle Hilbert space dimension $d$, has important potential for quantum information processing, with applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. For a pair of qudits of arbitrary even dimension $d$, we introduce a generalized Bell basis with definite symmetry under exchange of states between the two particles. We show that no complete exchange-symmetrized basis can exist for odd $d$. This framework extends prior work on exchange-symmetrized hyperentangled qubit bases, where $d$ is a power of two. As a direct application of our basis, we quantify the number of qudit Bell states that can be unambiguously distinguished by devices restricted to linear evolution and local measurement (LELM). We show that for any even $d$, at most $2d-1$ states can be reliably distinguished, extending known results for $d = 2^n$ and $d=3$.</description>

Abstract: We show that if a graph has minimum vertex degree at least d and girth at least g, where (d, g) is (3, 6) or (4, 4), then the incidence system of the graph has a (possibly infinite-dimensional) quantum solution over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for every choice of vertex weights and integer $p \geq 2$. In particular, there are linear systems over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, for $p$ an odd prime, such that the corresponding linear system nonlocal game has a perfect commuting-operator strategy, but no perfect classical strategy.</description>

      <title>Analysis and suppression of errors in quantum random access memory errors under extended noise models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is required for numerous quantum algorithms and network architectures. Previous work has shown that the ubiquitous bucket-brigade QRAM is highly resilient to arbitrary local incoherent noise channels occurring during the operation of the QRAM [PRX Quantum 2, 020311 (2021)], with query infidelities growing only polylogarithmically with memory width when errors are assumed to only occur on individual routers. We extend this result to a large class of generalized settings that turn up in realistic situations, including arbitrary initialization errors, spatially correlated errors, as well as coherent errors, maintaining the polylogarithmic scaling in all instances. Fully quantifying the extent to which QRAM's noise resilience holds may provide a guide for the design of QRAM architectures - for instance, the resilience to initialization errors indicates that a reset protocol between successive queries may not be necessary. In the case of coherent errors, we find an up to quadratic increase in the infidelity bound, and therefore discuss generalizations to randomized compiling schemes, which usually are rendered inapplicable in the QRAM setting, to tailor these errors into more favorable stochastic noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational form factors are often interpreted as providing access to stresses inside hadrons, in particular through Fourier transforms of the form factors $D$ and $\bar{c}$. Some researchers, however, have expressed skepticism of this interpretation. I revisit the question, and argue that it is indeed appropriate to interpret these quantities as stress distributions. I consider the hydrogen atom's ground state as a familiar example, and use the pilot wave interpretation of quantum mechanics to give the distributions a clear meaning. A striking result is that $\bar{c}$ -- rather than $D$ -- quantifies the force law binding the system, which can be understood through Cauchy's first law of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Towards the phase diagram of fermions coupled with $SO(3)$ quantum links in $(2+1)$-D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum link models (QLMs) are generalizations of Wilson's lattice gauge theory formulated with finite-dimensional link Hilbert spaces. In certain cases, the non-Abelian Gauss Law constraint can be exactly solved, and the gauge invariant subspace embedded onto local spin Hamiltonians for efficient quantum simulation. In $(1+1)d$ previous studies of the $SO(3)$ QLM coupled to adjoint fermionic matter have been shown to reflect key properties of QCD and nuclear physics, including distinct confining/deconfining phases and hadronic bound states. We extend the model to $(2+1)d$ dimensions for the first time, and report on our initial results. We review the construction of gauge-invariant state space for the proposed models, and study the single-plaquette ground state via exact-diagonalisation. We provide indications of a rich phase diagram which shows both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, confinement, and distinct magnetic phases characterised by different plaquette expectation values.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Topological Phase Transition of the Bosonic Kitaev Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bosonic Kitaev chain, just like its fermionic counterpart, has extraordinary properties. For example, it displays the non-Hermitian skin effect even without dissipation when the system is Hermitian. This means that all eigenmodes are exponentially localized to the edges of the chain. This is possible since the $\hat{x}$ and $\hat p$ quadratures decouple such that each of them is governed by a non-Hermitian dynamical matrix. In the topological phase of the model, the modes conspire to lead to exponential amplification of coherent light that depends on its phase and direction. In this work, we study the robustness of this topological amplification to on-site dissipation. We look at uniform and non-uniform dissipation and study the effect of different configurations. We find remarkable resilience to dissipation in some configurations, while in others the dissipation causes a topological phase transition which eliminates the exponential amplification. For example, when the dissipation is placed on every other site, the system remains topological even for very large dissipation which exceeds the system's non-Hermitian gap and the exponential amplification persists. On the other hand, dividing the chain into unit cells of an odd number of sites and placing dissipation on the first site leads to a topological phase transition at some critical value of the dissipation. Our work thus provides insights into topological amplification of multiband systems and sets explicit limits on the bosonic Kitaev chain's ability to act as a multimode quantum sensor.</description>

      <title>A high optical access cryogenic system for Rydberg atom arrays with a 3000-second trap lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optical tweezer array of $^{87}$Rb atoms housed in an cryogenic environment that successfully combines a 4 K cryopumping surface, a &lt;50 K cold box surrounding the atoms, and a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens. We demonstrate a 3000 s atom trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the $10^{-4}$ level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly-interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.</description>

      <title>A Practical Quantum Hoare Logic with Classical Variables, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Hoare-style logic for reasoning about quantum programs with classical variables. Our approach offers several improvements over previous work:
  (1) Enhanced expressivity of the programming language: Our logic applies to quantum programs with classical variables that incorporate quantum arrays and parameterised quantum gates, which have not been addressed in previous research on quantum Hoare logic, either with or without classical variables.
  (2) Intuitive correctness specifications: In our logic, preconditions and postconditions for quantum programs with classical variables are specified as a pair consisting of a classical first-order logical formula and a quantum predicate formula (possibly parameterised by classical variables). These specifications offer greater clarity and align more closely with the programmer's intuitive understanding of quantum and classical interactions.
  (3) Simplified proof system: By introducing a novel idea in formulating a proof rule for reasoning about quantum measurements, along with (2), we develop a proof system for quantum programs that requires only minimal modifications to classical Hoare logic. Furthermore, this proof system can be effectively and conveniently combined with classical first-order logic to verify quantum programs with classical variables.
  As a result, the learning curve for quantum program verification techniques is significantly reduced for those already familiar with classical program verification techniques, and existing tools for verifying classical programs can be more easily adapted for quantum program verification.</description>

      <title>Gaussian quantum Markov semigroups on finitely many modes admitting a normal invariant state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum Markov semigroups (GQMSs) are of fundamental importance in modelling the evolution of several quantum systems. Moreover, they represent the noncommutative generalization of classical Orsntein-Uhlenbeck semigroups; analogously to the classical case, GQMSs are uniquely determined by a "drift" matrix $\mathbf{Z}$ and a "diffusion" matrix $\mathbf{C}$, together with a displacement vector $\mathbf{\zeta}$. In this work, we completely characterize those GQMSs that admit a normal invariant state and we provide a description of the set of normal invariant states; as a side result, we are able to characterize quadratic Hamiltonians admitting a ground state. Moreover, we study the behavior of such semigroups for long times: firstly, we clarify the relationship between the decoherence-free subalgebra and the spectrum of $\mathbf{Z}$. Then, we prove that environment-induced decoherence takes place and that the dynamics approaches an Hamiltonian closed evolution for long times; we are also able to determine the speed at which this happens. Finally, we study convergence of ergodic means and recurrence and transience of the semigroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angular momentum and torque are important principles for basic and applied physics on any spatial scales, for example, in elementary particles, cold gases, optical tweezers, quantum information technology, metamaterials, gyroscopes or astrophysical entities. Investigating or controlling angular momentum in atoms or sub-atomic structures requires torque on femtosecond and picometer scales, far below the capabilities of laser light. Here we shape the electrons in an electron microscope into wave packets with a time-dependent chirality and internal torque. We intersect the electron beam with chiral laser light to create discrete energy sidebands by multiple helical photon absorptions that create a correlation between orbital angular momentum and kinetic energy. Dispersion of these partial waves due to the electron rest mass then converts each single electron into a wave function with internal torque. Under our control, a left-handed matter wave becomes right-handed in femtosecond times. Such quantum objects will facilitate research on angular momentum and chirality on atomic and sub-atomic scales.</description>

      <title>Enhanced photoisomerization with hybrid metallodielectric cavities based on mode interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control chemical reactions by coupling organic molecules to confined light in a cavity has recently attracted much attention. While most previous studies have focused on single-mode photonic or plasmonic cavities, here we investigate the effect of hybrid metallodielectric cavities on photoisomerization reactions. Hybrid cavities, which support both photonic and plasmonic modes, offer unique opportunities that arise from the interplay between these two distinct types of modes. Specifically, we demonstrate that interference in the spectral density due to a narrow photonic mode and a broad plasmonic mode that are coupled to each other enables hybrid cavities to provide an energy-selective Purcell effect. This effect enhances electronic relaxation only to the desired molecular geometry, providing the ability to increase the yield of photoisomerization reactions. As a test case, we study the asymmetric proton transfer reaction in the electronic excited state of 3-aminoacrolein. Our results, which are robust for a range of realistic cavity parameters, highlight the advantages of hybrid cavities in cavity-induced photochemical processes.</description>

Abstract: By gluing together two sections of flat space-time in different metric representations (with the Minkowski metric representing the region far away from the black hole and the Rindler metric modeling the vicinity of the horizon), we construct a simplified toy model for black-hole evaporation. The simple structure of this toy model allows us to construct exact analytic solutions for the two-point functions in the various vacuum states (Israel-Harte-Hawking, Unruh and Boulware states) in an easy way and thus helps to understand and disentangle the different ingredients for Hawking radiation better.</description>

      <title>Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization and constraint programming approaches for lattice-based cyclic peptide docking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The peptide-protein docking problem is an important problem in structural biology that facilitates rational and efficient drug design. In this work, we explore modeling and solving this problem with the quantum-amenable quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism. Our work extends recent efforts by incorporating the objectives and constraints associated with peptide cyclization and peptide-protein docking in the two-particle model on a tetrahedral lattice. We propose a ``resource efficient'' QUBO encoding for this problem, and baseline its performance with a novel constraint programming (CP) approach. We implement an end-to-end framework that enables the evaluation of our methods on instances from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our results show that the QUBO approach, using a classical simulated annealing solver, is able to find feasible conformations for problems with up to 6 peptide residues and 34 target protein residues, but has trouble scaling beyond this problem size. In contrast, the CP approach can solve problems with up to 13 peptide residues and 34 target protein residues. We conclude that while QUBO can be used to successfully tackle this problem, its scaling limitations and the strong performance of the CP method suggest that it may not be the best choice.</description>

Abstract: Transformations of transformations, also called higher-order transformations, is a natural concept in information processing, which has recently attracted significant interest in the study of quantum causal relations. In this work, a framework for characterizing higher-order quantum transformations which relies on the use of superoperator projectors is presented. More precisely, working with projectors in the Choi-Jamiolkowski picture is shown to provide a handy way of defining the characterization constraints on any class of higher-order transformations. The algebraic properties of these projectors are furthermore identified as a model of multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL). The main novelty of this work is the introduction in the algebra of the 'prec' connector. It is used for the characterization of maps that are no signaling from input to output or the other way around. This allows to assess the possible signaling structure of any maps characterized within the projective framework. The properties of the prec are moreover shown to yield a normal form for projective expressions. This provides a systematic way to compare different classes of higher-order transformations.</description>

Abstract: Linear constraint systems (LCS) have proven to be a surprisingly prolific tool in the study of non-classical correlations and various related issues in quantum foundations. Many results are known for the Boolean case, yet the generalisation to systems of odd dimension is largely open. In particular, it is not known whether there exist LCS in odd dimension, which admit finite-dimensional quantum, but no classical solutions. In recent work, [J. Phys. A, 53, 385304 (2020)] have shown that unlike in the Boolean case, where the n-qubit Pauli group gives rise to quantum solutions of LCS such as the Mermin-Peres square, the n-qudit Pauli group never gives rise to quantum solutions of a LCS in odd dimension. Here, we generalise this result towards the Clifford hierarchy. More precisely, we consider tensor products of groups generated by (single-qudit) Pauli and diagonal Clifford operators.</description>

Abstract: The jump unravelling of a quantum master equation decomposes the dynamics of an open quantum system into abrupt jumps, interspersed by periods of coherent dynamics when no jumps occur. Such open quantum systems are ubiquitous in quantum optics and mesoscopic physics, hence the need for efficient techniques for their stochastic simulation. Numerical simulation techniques fall into two main categories. The first splits the evolution into small timesteps and determines stochastically for each step if a jump occurs or not. The second, known as Monte Carlo Wavefunction simulation, is based on the reduction of the norm of an initially pure state in the conditional no-jump evolution. It exploits the fact that the purity of the state is preserved by the finest unraveling of the master equation. In this work, we present an alternative method for the simulation of the quantum jump unraveling, inspired by the classical Gillespie algorithm. The method is particularly well suited for situations in which a large number of trajectories is required for relatively small systems. It allows for non-purity-preserving dynamics, such as the ones generated by partial monitoring and channel merging. We describe the algorithm in detail and discuss relevant limiting cases. To illustrate it, we include four example applications of increasing physical complexity and discuss the performance of the algorithm across regimes of interest for open quantum systems simulation. Publicly available implementations of our code are provided in Julia and Mathematica.</description>

      <title>Robust Dequantization of the Quantum Singular value Transformation and Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several quantum algorithms for linear algebra problems, and in particular quantum machine learning problems, have been "dequantized" in the past few years. These dequantization results typically hold when classical algorithms can access the data via length-squared sampling. In this work we investigate how robust these dequantization results are. We introduce the notion of approximate length-squared sampling, where classical algorithms are only able to sample from a distribution close to the ideal distribution in total variation distance. While quantum algorithms are natively robust against small perturbations, current techniques in dequantization are not. Our main technical contribution is showing how many techniques from randomized linear algebra can be adapted to work under this weaker assumption as well. We then use these techniques to show that the recent low-rank dequantization framework by Chia, Gily\'en, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (JACM 2022) and the dequantization framework for sparse matrices by Gharibian and Le Gall (STOC 2022), which are both based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation, can be generalized to the case of approximate length-squared sampling access to the input. We also apply these results to obtain a robust dequantization of many quantum machine learning algorithms, including quantum algorithms for recommendation systems, supervised clustering and low-rank matrix inversion.</description>

Abstract: Shor's algorithm is one of the most significant quantum algorithms. Shor's algorithm can factor large integers with a certain success probability in polynomial time. However, Shor's algorithm requires an unbearable amount of qubits in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum) era. To reduce the resources required for Shor's algorithm, in this paper we first propose a new distributed phase estimation algorithm. Our distributed phase estimation algorithm does not require quantum communication and it reduces the number of qubits of a single node compared to the traditional phase estimation algorithm (non-iterative version). Then we apply our distributed phase estimation algorithm to form a distributed order-finding algorithm for Shor's algorithm. Compared with the traditional Shor's algorithm (non-iterative version), the maximum number of qubits required by a single node of our dristributed order-finding algorithm is reduced by $(2-\dfrac{2}{k})L-\log_2k-O(1)$ when factoring an $L$-bit integer ($k$ is the number of compute nodes). The communication complexity of our distributed order-finding algorithm is $O(kL)$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Unitary Formulation of Open Quantum System Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that all non-relativistic quantum processes, whether open or closed, are either unitary or probabilistic unitary, i.e., probabilistic combination of unitary evolutions. This means that for open quantum systems, its continuous dynamics can always be described by the Lindblad master equation with all jump operators being unitary. We call this formalism the probabilistic unitary formulation of open quantum system dynamics. This formalism is shown to be exact under all cases, and does not rely on any assumptions other than the continuity and differentiability of the density matrix. Moreover, it requires as few as $d-1$ jump operators, instead of $d^2-1$, to describe the open dynamics in the most general case, where $d$ is the dimension of Hilbert space of the system. Importantly, different from the conventional Lindblad master equation, this formalism is state-dependent, meaning that the Hamiltonian, jump operators, and rates, in general all depend on the current state of the density matrix. Hence one needs to know the explicit expression of the density matrix in order to write down the probabilistic unitary master equation explicitly. Experimentally, the formalism provides a scheme to control a quantum state to evolve along designed non-unitary quantum trajectories, and can be potentially useful in quantum computing and quantum control scenes since only unitary resources are needed for implementation.</description>

      <title>Generation of massively entangled bright states of light during harmonic generation in resonant media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the fundamental level, full description of light-matter interaction requires quantum treatment of both matter and light. However, for standard light sources generating intense laser pulses carrying quadrillions of photons in a coherent state, the classical description of light during intense laser-matter interaction has been expected to be adequate. Here we show how nonlinear optical response of matter can be controlled to generate dramatic deviations from this standard picture, including generation of several squeezed and entangled harmonics of the incident laser light. In particular, such non-trivial quantum states of harmonics are generated as soon as one of the harmonics induces a transition between different laser-dressed states of the material system. Such transitions generate an entangled light-matter wavefunction, which can generate quantum states of harmonics even in the absence of a quantum driving field or material correlations. In turn, entanglement of the material system with a single harmonic generates and controls entanglement between different harmonics. Hence, nonlinear media that are near-resonant with at least one of the harmonics appear to be quite attractive for controlled generation of massively entangled quantum states of light. Our analysis opens remarkable opportunities at the interface of attosecond physics and quantum optics, with implications for quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following a consistent geometrical description previously introduced in Parra-Rodriguez et al. (2024), we present an exact method for obtaining canonically quantizable Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear, nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks. We identify and classify singularities arising in the quest for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasi-lumped element networks via the Faddeev-Jackiw technique. We offer systematic solutions to cases previously considered singular--a major challenge in the context of canonical circuit quantization. The solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to multiport nonreciprocal lumped-element networks, with intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff. On the way we naturally extend the canonical quantization of transmission lines coupled through frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates the characterization of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments. This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, using continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We provide a tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of special interest in the context of canonical quantization of superconducting networks. For instance, this work will provide a solid ground for a precise non-divergent input-output theory in the presence of nonreciprocal devices, e.g., within (chiral) waveguide QED platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for generating a high-purity single photon on the basis of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme employs a four-level system including two excited states, two ground states, and two driving lasers; this structure allows the suppression of the re-excitation process due to the atomic decay, which is known to significantly degrade the single-photon purity in state-of-the-art photon sources using a three-level system. Our analysis shows that the re-excitation probability arbitrarily approaches zero without sacrificing the photon generation probability when increasing the power of the driving laser between the excited states. This advantage is achievable by using current cavity-QED technologies. Our scheme can contribute to developing distributed quantum computation or quantum communication with high accuracy.</description>

Abstract: A Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave amplifier (KIT) utilizes the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly Niobium Titanium Nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, compression power, and frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter we see an initial improvement in the flux noise. One challenge in KIT integration is the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication procedure, and initial device characterization -- including gain and added noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB and typical gain ripple under 4 dB peak-to-peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the gain ripple. Finally we perform an initial noise characterization and demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3 dB bandwidth.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an 'epileptic'-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modular quantum computation architecture based on utilizing multipartite entanglement. Each module consists of a small-scale quantum computer comprising data, memory and entangling qubits. Entangling qubits are used to selectively couple different modules by harnessing some non-controllable, distance-dependent interaction, which is effectively controlled and enhanced via a proper adjusting of the internal state of the qubits. In this way, multipartite entangled states with different entanglement topologies can be shared between modules. These states are stored in memory qubits where they can be further processed so they can eventually be used to deterministically perform certain classes of gates or circuits between modules on demand, including parallel controlled-Z gates with arbitrary interaction patterns, multi-qubit gates or whole Clifford circuits, depending on their entanglement structure. The usage of different kinds of multipartite entanglement rather than Bell pairs allows for more efficient and flexible coupling between modules, leading to a scalable quantum computation architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems is typically fragile to interactions with the environment. Generic unital quantum channels, for example, have the maximally mixed state with no entanglement as their unique steady state. However, we find that for a unital quantum channel that is `strongly symmetric', i.e. it preserves a global on-site symmetry, the maximally mixed steady state in certain symmetry sectors can be highly entangled. For a given symmetry, we analyze the entanglement and correlations of the maximally mixed state in the invariant sector (MMIS), and show that the entanglement of formation and distillation are exactly computable and equal for any bipartition. For all Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is separable, and for all non-Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is entangled. Remarkably, for non-Abelian continuous symmetries described by compact semisimple Lie groups (e.g. $SU(2)$), the bipartite entanglement of formation for the MMIS scales logarithmically $\sim \log N$ with the number of qudits $N$.</description>

Abstract: We study active steering protocols for weakly measured qubits in the presence of error channels due to amplitude and phase noise. If the error rate is sufficiently small, the protocol approaches and stabilizes a predesignated pure target state with high fidelity and high purity, and thus implements autonomous state stabilization. We present numerical simulation results for one and two qubits, taking Andreev qubit circuits as example. As function of the error rate, a sharp threshold separates an error-correcting weak-damping regime from a strong-damping regime where the target state cannot be reached anymore. At the threshold, the purity gap closes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though parameter shift rules have drastically improved gradient estimation methods for several types of quantum circuits, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks, so far they have not been transferable to linear optics with single photons. In this work, we derive an analytical formula for the gradients in these circuits with respect to phaseshifters via a generalized parameter shift rule, where the number of parameter shifts depends linearly on the total number of photons. Experimentally, this enables access to derivatives in photonic systems without the need for finite difference approximations. Building on this, we propose two strategies through which one can reduce the number of shifts in the expression, and hence reduce the overall sample complexity. Numerically, we show that this generalized parameter-shift rule can converge to the minimum of a cost function with fewer parameter update steps than alternative techniques. We anticipate that this method will open up new avenues to solving optimization problems with photonic systems, as well as provide new techniques for the experimental characterization and control of linear optical systems.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>

Abstract: This article discusses a p-adic version of the infinite potential well in quantum mechanics (QM). This model describes the confinement of a particle in a p-adic ball. We rigorously solve the Cauchy problem for the Schr\"odinger equation and determine the stationary solutions. The p-adic balls are fractal objects. By dividing a p-adic ball into a finite number of sub-balls and using the wavefunctions of the infinite potential well, we construct a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a fully connected graph, where each vertex corresponds to a sub-ball in the partition of the original ball. In this way, we establish a connection between p-adic QM and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimal Geometry of Oscillators in Gravity-Induced Entanglement Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of interfacing quantum mechanics and gravity has long been an unresolved issue in physics. Recent advances in precision measurement technology suggest that detecting gravitational effects in massive quantum systems, particularly gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in the oscillator system, could provide crucial empirical evidence for revealing the quantum nature of the gravitational field. However, thermal decoherence imposes strict constraints on system parameters. For entanglement to occur, the inequality $2 \gamma_m k_B T &lt; \hbar G \Lambda \rho$ must be satisfied, linking mechanical dissipation $\gamma_m$, effective temperature $T$, oscillator density $\rho$ and form factor $\Lambda$ determined by the geometry and spatial arrangement of the oscillators. This inequality, based on the inherent property of the noise model of GIE, is considered universally across experimental systems and cannot be improved by quantum control. Given the challenges in further optimizing $\gamma_m$, $\rho$, and $T$ near their limits, optimizing the form factor $\Lambda$ may reduce demands on other parameters. In this work, we prove that the form factor $\Lambda$ has a supremum of $2\pi$, revealing a fundamental limit of the oscillator system. We propose design schemes that enable the form factor to approach this supremum, which is nearly an order of magnitude higher than typical spherical oscillators. This optimization may ease experimental constraints, bringing GIE-based validation of quantum gravity closer to realization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various approaches to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles. Discrete and continuous symmetries are under consideration. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with three further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra. The further requirements are: spectrality, a strong state space and a condition called gbit property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the frequency configuration of qubits and quantum gates in superconducting quantum chips presents a complex NP-complete optimization challenge. This process is critical for enabling practical control while minimizing decoherence and suppressing significant crosstalk. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based frequency configuration approach. A trained neural network model estimates frequency configuration errors, and an intermediate optimization strategy identifies optimal configurations within localized regions of the chip. The effectiveness of our method is validated through randomized benchmarking and cross-entropy benchmarking. Furthermore, we design a crosstalk-aware hardware-efficient ansatz for variational quantum eigensolvers, achieving improved energy computations.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models: SU($N$) magnetic $\eta$ pairing, weak ergodicity breaking, and partial integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models in arbitrary dimensions by generalizing the $\eta$-pairing mechanism. Our models include the SU($N$) Hubbard model as a special case. Unlike the conventional two-component case, the generalized $\eta$-pairing mechanism permits the construction of eigenstates that feature off-diagonal long-range order and magnetic long-range order. These states form fragmented fermionic condensates due to a simultaneous condensation of multicomponent $\eta$ pairs. While the $\eta$-pairing states in the SU(2) Hubbard model are based on the $\eta$-pairing symmetry, the exact eigenstates in the $N$-component system with $N\geq 3$ arise not from symmetry of the Hamiltonian but from a spectrum generating algebra defined in a Hilbert subspace. We exploit this fact to show that the generalized $\eta$-pairing eigenstates do not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and serve as quantum many-body scar states. This result indicates a weak breakdown of ergodicity in the $N$-component Hubbard models for $N\geq 3$. Furthermore, we show that these exact eigenstates constitute integrable subsectors in which the Hubbard Hamiltonian effectively reduces to a non-interacting model. This partial integrability causes various multicomponent Hubbard models to weakly break ergodicity. We propose a method of harnessing dissipation to distill the integrable part of the dynamics and elucidate a mechanism of non-thermalization caused by dissipation. This work establishes the coexistence of off-diagonal long-range order and SU($N$) magnetism in excited eigenstates of the multicomponent Hubbard models, which presents a possibility of novel out-of-equilibrium pairing states of multicomponent fermions. These models unveil a unique feature of quantum thermalization of multicomponent fermions, which can experimentally be tested with cold-atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quasicondensation and off-diagonal long-range order of hard-core bosons during a free expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasicondensation in one dimension is known to occur for equilibrium systems of hard-core bosons (HCBs) at zero temperature. This phenomenon arises due to the off-diagonal long-range order in the ground state, characterized by a power-law decay of the one-particle density matrix $g_1(x,y)\sim |x-y|^{-1/2}$, a well-known outcome of Luttinger liquid theory. Remarkably, HCBs, when allowed to freely expand from an initial product state (i.e., characterized by initial zero correlation), exhibit quasicondensation and demonstrate the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order during nonequilibrium dynamics. This phenomenon has been substantiated by numerical and experimental investigations in the early 2000s. In this work, we revisit the dynamical quasicondensation of HCBs, providing a fully analytical treatment of the issue. In particular, we derive an exact asymptotic formula for the equal-time one-particle density matrix by borrowing ideas from the framework of quantum Generalized Hydrodynamics. Our findings elucidate the phenomenology of quasicondensation and of dynamical fermionization occurring at different stages of the time evolution, as well as the crossover between the two.</description>

      <title>Identification of highly-forbidden optical transitions in highly charged ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical clocks represent the most precise experimental devices, finding application in fields spanning from frequency metrology to fundamental physics. Recently, the first highly charged ions (HCI) based optical clock was demonstrated using Ar$^{13+}$, opening up a plethora of novel systems with advantageous atomic properties for high accuracy clocks. While numerous candidate systems have been explored theoretically, the considerable uncertainty of the clock transition frequency for most species poses experimental challenges. Here, we close this gap by exploring quantum logic-inspired experimental search techniques for sub-Hertz clock transitions in HCI confined to a linear Paul trap. These techniques encompass Rabi excitation, an optical dipole force (ODF) approach, and linear continuous sweeping (LCS) and their applicability for different types of HCI. Through our investigation, we provide tools to pave the way for the development of exceptionally precise HCI-based optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Quantumness of relic gravitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Green's function approach to interacting lattice polaritons and optical nonlinearities in subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-wavelength arrays of quantum emitters offer an efficient free-space approach to coherent light-matter interfacing, using ultracold atoms or two-dimensional solid-state quantum materials. The combination of collectively suppressed photon-losses and emerging optical nonlinearities due to strong photon-coupling to mesoscopic numbers of emitters holds promise for generating nonclassical light and engineering effective interactions between freely propagating photons. While most studies have thus far relied on numerical simulations, we describe here a diagrammatic Green's function approach that permits analytical investigations of nonlinear processes. We illustrate the method by deriving a simple expression for the scattering matrix that describes photon-photon interactions in an extended two-dimensional array of quantum emitters, and reproduces the results of numerical simulations of coherently driven arrays. The approach yields intuitive insights into the nonlinear response of the system and offers a promising framework for a systematic development of a theory for interacting photons and many-body effects on collective radiance in two-dimensional arrays of quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogenoeus non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. Depending on whether we turn on a complex external gauge field, we find solutions that spontaneously break PT (thus hinting at a lack of unitary evolution) and solutions that do not. The former present an imaginary current responsible for the spontaneous breaking of PT. We also study the IR geometry of these solutions finding that they flow to a PT-unbroken fixed point. This leads us to claim that there is a PT-symmetry restoration in the IR, similar to the one observed in the perturbative setup of arXiv:2110.05289.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantized vortex in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at Dirac point</title>

Abstract: When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for classical and quantum uncertainty relations using stochastic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) and kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) provide tradeoff relations between measurement precision and thermodynamic cost such as entropy production and activity. Conventionally, these relations are derived using the Cram\'er-Rao inequality, which involves an auxiliary perturbation in deterministic differential equations governing the time evolution of the system's probability distribution. In this study, without relying on the previous formulation based on deterministic evolving equation, we demonstrate that all previously discovered uncertainty relations can be derived solely through the stochastic representation of the same dynamics. For this purpose, we propose a unified method based on stochastic representations for general Markovian dynamics. Extending beyond classical systems, we apply this method to Markovian open quantum systems by unraveling their dynamics, deriving quantum uncertainty relations that are physically more accessible and tighter in regimes where quantum effects play a significant role. This fully establishes uncertainty relations for both classical and quantum systems as intrinsic properties of their stochastic nature.</description>
