      <title>Tensor-based compression of the sea temperature data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate efficient data compression for spatiotemporal Black, Azov and Marmara Seas temperature tensors that contain significant number of missing values. These tensors have a complex structure influenced by the coastlines and bathymetry, as well as temporal temperature changes. While such missing data typically provokes utilization of tensor completion algorithms, we demonstrate that standard SVD-based compression approaches (including the Tucker, Tensor-Train (TT) and Quantized-TT formats) are remarkably effective and yield comparable results. We propose a greedy spatial data partitioning algorithm enhancing their performance. We divide the data into the smaller subtensors before compression via exploitation of this trick.
  Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong temporal dependency in the data's compressibility caused by its nature. Fixing the level of precision we observe a significant seasonal variation. Investigating this, we find that a temporal partitioning on a scale of approximately two days is nearly optimal for all tested tensor based formats. The combined application of these spatial and temporal strategies with tensor methods ultimately achieves a robust compression ratio of 5 times across the entire dataset.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Intersections on a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fast, high-precision algorithm for calculating intersections between great circle arcs and lines of constant latitude on the unit sphere. We first propose a simplified intersection point formula with improved speed and numerical robustness over the ones traditionally implemented in geoscience software. We then show how algorithms based on the concept of error-free transformations (EFT) can be applied to evaluate this formula within a relative error bound that is on the order of machine precision. We demonstrate that, with a vectorized and parallelized implementation, this enhanced accuracy is achieved with no compute-time overhead compared to a direct calculation in hardware floating point, making our algorithm suitable for performance-sensitive applications like regridding of high-resolution climate data. In contrast, evaluating our formula using high-precision data types like quadruple precision and arbitrary precision, or using the robust intersection computation routines from the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL), leads to significant computational overhead, especially since these alternatives inhibit vectorization. More generally, our work demonstrates how EFT techniques can be combined and extended to implement nontrivial geometric calculations with high accuracy and speed.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Laplacian and numerical approximation of Laplace-Beltrami spectrum of compact Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a numerical approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on compact surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with an axial symmetry. To do so we use a noncommutative Laplace operator defined on the space of finite dimensional hermitian matrices. This operator is derived from a foliation of the surface obtained under an $S^1$-action on the surface. We present numerical results in the case of the sphere and a generic ellipsoid.</description>

      <title>Finite element analysis of a nonlinear heat Equation with damping and pumping effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following nonlinear heat equation with damping and pumping effects (a reaction-diffusion equation) posed on a bounded simply connected convex domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \geq 1$ with Lipschitz boundary $\partial\Omega$: $$ \frac{\partial u(t)}{\partial t} - \nu \Delta u(t) + \alpha |u(t)|^{p-2}u(t) - \sum_{\ell=1}^M \beta_{\ell} |u(t)|^{q_{\ell}-2}u(t) = f(t), \quad t&gt;0, $$ subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and the initial condition $u(0)=u_0$, where $2 \leq p &lt; \infty$ and $2 \leq q_{\ell} &lt; p$ for $1 \leq \ell \leq M$. For $u_0 \in L^2(\Omega)$ and $f \in L^2(0,T;H^{-1}(\Omega))$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution for all dimensions $d \in \mathbb{N}$ and damping exponents $2 \leq p &lt; \infty$. Furthermore, for $u_0 \in H^2(\Omega) \cap H_0^1(\Omega)$ and $f \in H^1(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$, we obtain regularity results: these hold for every $2 \leq p &lt; \infty$ when $1 \leq d \leq 4$, and for $2 \leq p \leq \frac{2d-6}{d-4}$ when $d \geq 5$. We further conduct finite element analysis using conforming, nonconforming, and discontinuous Galerkin methods, deriving a priori error estimates for both semi- and fully discrete schemes, supported by numerical results. To relax restrictions on $p$ in the semidiscrete analysis, we use appropriate projection/interpolation operators: the Ritz projection in the conforming case ($2 \le p \le \frac{2d}{d-2}$), the Scott-Zhang interpolation for $\frac{2d}{d-2} &lt; p \le \frac{2d-6}{d-4}$, the Cl\'ement interpolation in the nonconforming setting, and the $L^2$-projection in the DG framework. In the fully discrete case, error estimates hold for the above $p$-range under $u_0 \in D(A^{3/2})$ and $f \in H^1(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$.</description>

      <title>Weighted implicit-explicit discontinuous Galerkin methods for two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equations on general meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a second-order linearized discontinuous Galerkin method on general meshes, which treats the backward differentiation formula of order two (BDF2) and Crank-Nicolson schemes as special cases, is proposed for solving the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equations with cubic nonlinearity. By utilizing the discontinuous Galerkin inverse inequality and the mathematical induction method, the unconditionally optimal error estimate in $L^2$-norm is obtained. The core of the analysis in this paper resides in the classification and discussion of the relationship between the temporal step size and the spatial step size, specifically distinguishing between the two scenarios of tau^2 \leq h^{k+1}$and$\tau^2 &gt; h^{k+1}$, where$k$denotes the degree of the discrete spatial scheme. Finally, this paper presents two numerical examples involving various grids and polynomial degrees to verify the correctness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Learning Operators through Coefficient Mappings in Fixed Basis Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for approximating solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) and other functional mappings. \textcolor{red}{}{Classical approaches} typically adopt a pointwise-to-pointwise framework, where input functions are sampled at prescribed locations and mapped directly to solution values. We propose the Fixed-Basis Coefficient to Coefficient Operator Network (FB-C2CNet), which learns operators in the coefficient space induced by prescribed basis functions. In this framework, the input function is projected onto a fixed set of basis functions (e.g., random features or finite element bases), and the neural operator predicts the coefficients of the solution function in the same or another basis. By decoupling basis selection from network training, FB-C2CNet reduces training complexity, enables systematic analysis of how basis choice affects approximation accuracy, and clarifies what properties of coefficient spaces (such as effective rank and coefficient variations) are critical for generalization. Numerical experiments on Darcy flow, Poisson equations in regular, complex, and high-dimensional domains, and elasticity problems demonstrate that FB-C2CNet achieves high accuracy and computational efficiency, showing its strong potential for practical operator learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Staggered time discretization in finitely-strained heterogeneous visco-elastodynamics with damage or diffusion in the Eulerian frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-implicit (partly decoupled, also called staggered or fraction-step) time discretization is applied to compressible nonlinear dynamical models of viscoelastic solids in the Eulerian description, i.e.\ in the actual deforming configuration, formulated fully in terms of rates. The Kelvin-Voigt rheology and also, in the deviatoric part, the Jeffreys rheology are considered. The numerical stability and, considering the Stokes-type viscosity multipolar of the 2nd-grade, also convergence towards weak solutions are proved in three-dimensional situations, exploiting the convexity of the kinetic energy when written in terms of linear momentum. No (poly)convexity of the stored energy is required and some enhancements (specifically towards damage and diffusion models) are briefly outlined, too.</description>

      <title>Exact deflation for accurate SVD computation of nonnegative bidiagonal products of arbitrary rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dealing with zero singular values can be quite challenging, as they have the potential to cause numerous numerical difficulties. This paper presents a method for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a nonnegative bidiagonal product of arbitrary rank, regardless of whether the factors are of full rank or rank-deficient, square or rectangular. A key feature of our method is its ability to exactly deflate all zero singular values with a favorable complexity, irrespective of rank deficiency and ill conditioning. Furthermore, it ensures the computation of nonzero singular values, no matter how small they may be, with high relative accuracy. Additionally, our method is well-suited for accurately computing the SVDs of arbitrary submatrices, leveraging an approach to extract their representations from the original product. We have conducted error analysis and numerical experiments to validate the claimed high relative accuracy.</description>

      <title>Uniformly High Order Discontinuous Galerkin Gas Kinetic Scheme for Compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a uniformly high-order discontinuous Galerkin gas kinetic scheme (DG-HGKS) is proposed to solve the Euler equations of compressible flows. The new scheme is an extension of the one-stage compact and efficient high-order GKS (CEHGKS, Li et al. , 2021. J. Comput. Phys. 447, 110661) in the finite volume framework. The main ideas of the new scheme consist of two parts. Firstly, starting from a fully discrete DG formulation, the numerical fluxes and volume integrals are expanded in time. Secondly, the time derivatives are replaced by spatial derivatives using the techniques in CEHGKS. To suppress the non-physical oscillations in the discontinuous regions while minimizing the number of "troubled cells", an effective limiter strategy compatible with the new scheme has been developed by combining the KXRCF indicator and the SHWENO reconstruction technique. The new scheme can achieve arbitrary high-order accuracy in both space and time, thereby breaking the previous limitation of no more than third-order accuracy in existing one-stage DG-HGKS schemes. Numerical tests in 1D and 2D have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Novel superconvergence and ultraconvergence structures for the finite volume element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops novel natural superconvergence and ultraconvergence structures for the bi-$k$-order finite volume element (FVE) method on rectangular meshes. These structures furnish tunable and possibly asymmetric superconvergence and ultraconvergence points. We achieve one-order-higher superconvergence for both derivatives and function values, and two-orders-higher ultraconvergence for derivatives--a phenomenon that standard bi-$k$-order finite elements do not exhibit. Derivative ultraconvergence requires three conditions: a diagonal diffusion tensor, zero convection coefficients, and the FVE scheme satisfying tensorial $k$-$k$-order orthogonality (imposed via dual mesh constraints). This two-dimensional derivative ultraconvergence is not a trivial tensor-product extension of the one-dimensional phenomena; its analysis is also considerably more complex due to directional coupling. Theoretically, we introduce the asymmetric-enabled M-decompositions (AMD-Super and AMD-Ultra) to rigorously prove these phenomena. Numerical experiments confirm the theory.</description>

      <title>Existence and numerical approximation of a one-dimensional Boussinesq system with variable coefficients on a finite interval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of a nonlinear dispersive model with variable coefficients that describes the evolution of surface waves propagating through a one-dimensional shallow water channel of finite length with irregular bottom topography. To complement the theoretical analysis, we utilize the numerical solver developed by the authors in \cite{PizoMunoz} to approximate solutions of the model on a finite spatial interval, considering various parameter values and forms of the variable coefficients in the Boussinesq system under study. Additionally, we present preliminary numerical experiments addressing an inverse problem: the reconstruction of the initial wave elevation and fluid velocity from measurements taken at a final time. This is achieved by formulating an optimization problem in which the initial conditions are estimated as minimizers of a functional that quantifies the discrepancy between the observed final state and the numerical solution evolved from a trial initial state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imposition of tariffs by President Trump during his second term had far-reaching consequences for global markets, including Australia. This study investigates how both the announcement and subsequent implementation of these tariffs, specifically on 02-Apr-2025, affected the Australian stock market, focusing on the S\&amp;P/ASX 200 index over the period from 21-Jan-2025 to 25-Jul-2025. To accurately capture the significance and behavior of market fluctuations, the exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied. Furthermore, the impact of tariffs on stock performance is evaluated using machine learning-based regression models. A comparative assessment of these models is conducted to determine their predictive accuracy and robustness in capturing tariff-related market responses.</description>

      <title>Multilevel correction type of adaptive finite element method for Hartree-Fock equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for solving the Hartree--Fock equation combining a multilevel correction scheme with an adaptive refinement technique to improve computational efficiency. The algorithm integrates a multilevel correction framework with an optimized implementation strategy. Within this framework, a series of linearized boundary value problems are solved, and their approximate solutions are corrected by solving small-scale Hartree--Fock equations in low-dimensional correction spaces. The correction space comprises a coarse space and the solution to the linearized boundary value problem, enabling high accuracy while preserving low-dimensional characteristics. The proposed algorithm efficiently addresses the inherent computational complexity of the Hartree--Fock equation. Innovative correction strategies eliminate the need for direct computation of large-scale nonlinear eigenvalue systems and dense matrix operations. Furthermore, optimization techniques based on precomputations within the correction space render the total computational workload nearly independent of the number of self-consistent field iterations. This approach significantly accelerates the solution process of the Hartree--Fock equation, effectively mitigating the traditional exponential scaling demands on computational resources while maintaining precision.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Graph Reduction for Heterogeneous and Anisotropic Discrete Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multiscale graph-based reduction algorithms for upscaling heterogeneous and anisotropic diffusion problems. The proposed coarsening approaches begin by constructing a partitioning of the computational domain into a set of balanced local subdomains, resulting in a standard type of domain decomposition. Given this initial decomposition, general coarsening techniques based on spectral clustering are applied within each subgraph in order to accurately identify the key microscopic features of a given system. The spectral clustering algorithm is based on local generalized eigen-decompositions applied to the signed graph Laplacian. The resulting coarse-fine splittings are combined with two variants of energy-minimizing strategies for constructing coarse bases for diffusion problems. The first is an unconstrained minimization formulation in which local harmonic extensions are applied column-wise to construct multi-vector preserving interpolation in each region, whereas the second approach is a variant of the constrained energy minimization formulations derived in the context of non-local multi-continua upscaling techniques. We apply the resulting upscaling algorithms to a variety of tests coming from the graph Laplacian, including diffusion in the perforated domain, channelized media, highly anisotropic settings, and discrete pore network models to demonstrate the potential and robustness of the proposed coarsening approaches. We show numerically and theoretically that the proposed approaches lead to accurate coarse-scale models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the inverse drift problem in the one-dimensional parabolic equation with the final time data. The authors construct an operator first, whose fixed points are the unknown drift, and then apply it to prove the uniqueness. The proof of uniqueness contains an iteration converging to the drift, which inspires the numerical algorithm. To handle the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, the authors add the mollification on the data first in the iterative algorithm, and then provide some numerical results.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) has been successfully applied to many engineering design optimization problems, where the cost of high-fidelity simulations and experiments can be prohibitive. However, challenges remain for constrained optimization problems using the MFBO framework, particularly in efficiently identifying the feasible region defined by the constraints. In this paper, we propose a constrained multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (CMFBO) method with novel acquisition functions. Specifically, we design efficient acquisition functions that 1) have analytically closed-form expressions; 2) are straightforward to implement; and 3) do not require feasible initial samples, an important feature often missing in commonly used acquisition functions such as expected constrained improvement (ECI). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on synthetic test problems using different combinations of acquisition functions. Then, we apply the proposed method to a data-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF) design problem, and a high-current joint design problem using finite element simulations with computational contact mechanics.</description>

      <title>Parareal in time and spectral in space fast L1 quasilinear subdiffusion solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial-boundary value problem for a quasilinear time-fractional diffusion equation, and develop a fully discrete solver combining the parareal algorithm in time with a L1 finite-difference approximation of the Caputo derivative and a spectral Galerkin discretization in space. Our main contribution is the first rigorous convergence proof for the parareal-L1 scheme in this nonlinear subdiffusive setting. By constructing suitable energy norms and exploiting the orthogonality of the spectral basis, we establish that the parareal iterations converge exactly to the fully serial L1-spectral solution in a finite number of steps, with rates independent of the fractional exponent. The spectral spatial discretization yields exponential accuracy in space, while the parareal structure induces a clock speedup proportional to the number of processors, making the overall method highly efficient. Numerical experiments for both subdiffusive and classical diffusion problems confirm our theoretical estimates and demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in computational time compared to the conventional sequential solver. We observe that the speedup of the parareal method increases linearly with the fine integrator degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>On Runge-Kutta convolution quadrature based fractional variational integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian systems subject to fractional damping can be incorporated into a variational formalism. The construction can be made by doubling the state variables and introducing fractional derivatives \cite{JiOb2}. The main objective of this paper is to use the Runge-Kutta convolution quadrature (RKCQ) method for approximating fractional derivatives, combined with higher order Galerkin methods in order to derive fractional variational integrators (FVIs). We are specially interested in the CQ based on Lobatto IIIC. Preservation properties such as energy decay as well as convergence properties are investigated numerically and proved for 2nd order schemes. The presented schemes reach 2nd, 4th and 6th accuracy order. A brief discussion on the midpoint fractional integrator is also included.</description>

      <title>A GPU-Accelerated Matrix-Free FAS Multigrid Solver for Navier-Stokes Equations with Memory-Efficient Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a matrix-free Full Approximation Storage (FAS) multigrid solver based on staggered finite differences and implemented on GPU in MATLAB. To enhance performance, intermediate variables are reused, and an X-shape Multi-Color Gauss-Seidel (X-MCGS) smoother is introduced, which eliminates conditional branching by partitioning the grid into four submatrices. Restriction and prolongation operators are also GPU-accelerated. Convergence tests verify robustness and accuracy, while benchmarks show substantial speedups: for the 2D heat equation on an $8192^2$ grid, the RTX~4090 achieves $61\times$ over a single-core CPU, and in 3D at $512^3$, $46\times$. A memory-efficient implementation of first- and second-order projection schemes reduces GPU-resident variables from 12/15 to 8, lowering memory footprint and improving performance by 20--30%, enabling $512^3$ Navier-Stokes simulations on a single GPU. Grain growth on a $512^2$ grid accommodates up to $q=1189$ (2D) and $q=123$ (3D) orientations, reproducing expected scaling laws. Coupled with Cahn-Hilliard equations, air-water two-bubble coalescence is simulated on a $256\times 256\times 1024$ grid, agreeing with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Randomized flexible Krylov methods for $\ell_p$ regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of sparse solutions of large-scale linear discrete ill-posed problems remains a computationally demanding task. A powerful framework in this context is the use of iteratively reweighted schemes, which are based on constructing a sequence of quadratic tangent majorants of the $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ regularization functional (with additional smoothing to ensure differentiability at the origin), and solving them successively. Recently, flexible Krylov-Tikhonov methods have been used to partially solve each problem in the sequence efficiently. However, in order to guarantee convergence, the complexity of the algorithm at each iteration increases with respect to more traditional methods. We propose a randomized flexible Krylov method to alleviate the increase of complexity, which leverages the adaptability of the flexible Krylov subspaces with the efficiency of `sketch-and-solve' methods. A possible caveat of the mentioned methods is their memory requirements. In this case, one needs to rely instead on inner-outer schemes. In these scenarios, we propose a `sketch-to-precondition' method to speed up the convergence of each of the subproblems in the sequence. The performance of these algorithms is shown through a variety of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Forward and backward error bounds for a mixed precision preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm is one of the most popular algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems Ax = b, where A is a symmetric positive definite matrix. Rather than computing residuals directly, it updates the residual vectors recursively. Current analyses of the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm in finite precision typically assume that the norm of the recursively updated residual goes orders of magnitude below the machine precision, focusing mainly on bounding the residual gap thereafter. This work introduces a framework for the PCG algorithm and provides rigorous proofs that the relative backward and forward errors of the computed results of PCG can reach the levels O(u) and O(u)\kappa(A)^{1/2}, respectively, after a sufficient number of iterations without relying on an assumption concerning the norm of the recursively updated residual, where u represents the unit roundoff and \kappa(A) is the condition number of A. Our PCG framework further shows that applying preconditioners in low precision does not compromise the accuracy of the final results, provided that reasonable conditions are satisfied. Our theoretical results are illustrated through a set of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>DE-Sinc approximation for unilateral rapidly decreasing functions and its computational error bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sinc approximation is known to be a highly efficient approximation formula for rapidly decreasing functions. For unilateral rapidly decreasing functions, which rapidly decrease as $x\to\infty$ but does not as $x\to-\infty$, an appropriate variable transformation makes the functions rapidly decreasing. As such a variable transformation, Stenger proposed $t = \sinh(\log(\operatorname{arsinh}(\exp x)))$, which enables the Sinc approximation to achieve root-exponential convergence. Recently, another variable transformation $t = 2\sinh(\log(\log(1+\exp x)))$ was proposed, which improved the convergence rate. Furthermore, its computational error bound was provided. However, the improvement is not significant because the convergence rate is still root-exponential order. To improve the convergence rate drastically, this study proposes a new transformation $t = 2\sinh(\log(\log(1+\exp(\pi\sinh x))))$, which is categorized as the double-exponential (DE) transformation. Furthermore, this study provides its computational error bound, which shows that the proposed approximation formula may achieve almost exponential convergence. Numerical experiments that confirm the theoretical result are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the numerical approximation of the Lindblad master equation on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We employ a classical Galerkin approach for spatial discretization and investigate the convergence of the discretized solution to the exact solution. Using \textit{a priori} estimates, we derive explicit convergence rates and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through examples motivated by autonomous quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>An adaptive time-stepping strategy for the modified phase field crystal model with a strong nonlinear vacancy potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops three linear and energy-stable schemes for a modified phase field crystal model with a strong nonlinear vacancy potential (VMPFC model). This sixth-order phase-field model enables realistic crystal growth simulation. Starting from a Crank-Nicolson scheme based on the stabilized-SAV (S-SAV) method, we optimize it via the generalized positive auxiliary variable (GPAV) and modified exponential scalar auxiliary variable (ESAV) methods, thereby reducing computational complexity or eliminating the requirement for the nonlinear free energy potential to be bounded from below. The newly developed Energy-Variation Moving Average (EV-MA) adaptive time-stepping strategy resolves numerical instabilities and mitigates the high parameter sensitivity of the conventional adaptive time algorithm during rapid energy decay in the strongly nonlinear system. Unlike conventional instantaneous energy-derivative monitors, the EV-MA technique incorporates a moving average of the energy variation. Additionally, the rate of change between adjacent time steps is constrained by a maximum change factor. This design effectively dampens spurious oscillations and enhances the robustness of time step selection. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy and energy stability of the proposed schemes. The EV-MA strategy is also demonstrated to perform robustly across a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernels are key in machine learning for modeling interactions. Unfortunately, brute-force computation of the related kernel sums scales quadratically with the number of samples. Recent Fourier-slicing methods lead to an improved linear complexity, provided that the kernel can be sliced and its Fourier coefficients are known. To obtain these coefficients, we view the slicing relation as an inverse problem and present two algorithms for their recovery. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our methods.</description>

Abstract: We derive mixed finite element discretizations of a cold relativistics fluid model from approximations of the Poisson bracket that preserve mass, energy and the divergence constraints. For time-discretization we derive an implicit energy-conserving average-vector field method or apply an explicit strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme. We also consider a coupling of the fluid model to relativistic particles. We perform a numerical study of the scheme which shows convergence and conservation properties of the proposed methods and apply the new scheme to a plasma wake field simulation.</description>

      <title>A fourth-order active flux method for parabolic problems with application to porous medium equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method originally proposed for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, in which cell averages and point values at cell interfaces are evolved simultaneously. This paper develops a fourth-order AF method for one- and two-dimensional parabolic problems, employing the explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) method for time integration. The proposed method is built on a degenerate first-order system with auxiliary variables representing the derivatives of the primal variable, similar to local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods, which avoids introducing pseudo-time or performing iterations within a physical time step in the existing hyperbolic formulations. The evolution of cell averages follows the standard finite volume method, ensuring conservation, while the point values of both the primal and auxiliary variables are updated using fourth-order central finite difference operators. A discrete Fourier analysis confirms the fourth-order accuracy in 1D. With the third-order SSP-RK method, the maximum CFL number for stability is $0.27$ in 1D, as obtained by von Neumann analysis, larger than that of LDG methods. The proposed method is further applied to the porous medium equation, and positivity-preserving limitings are incorporated to guarantee the non-negativity of the numerical solutions. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and efficacy of the method.</description>

      <title>Performance of Machine Learning Methods for Gravity Inversion: Successes and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity inversion is the problem of estimating subsurface density distributions from observed gravitational field data. We consider the two-dimensional (2D) case, in which recovering density models from one-dimensional (1D) measurements leads to an underdetermined system with substantially more model parameters than measurements, making the inversion ill-posed and non-unique. Recent advances in machine learning have motivated data-driven approaches for gravity inversion. We first design a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to directly map gravity anomalies to density fields, where a customized data structure is introduced to enhance the inversion performance. To further investigate generative modeling, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), reformulating inversion as a latent-space optimization constrained by the forward operator. In addition, we assess whether classical iterative solvers such as Gradient Descent (GD), GMRES, LGMRES, and a recently proposed Improved Conjugate Gradient (ICG) method can refine CNN-based initial guesses and improve inversion accuracy. Our results demonstrate that CNN inversion not only provides the most reliable reconstructions but also significantly outperforms previously reported methods. Generative models remain promising but unstable, and iterative solvers offer only marginal improvements, underscoring the persistent ill-posedness of gravity inversion.</description>

      <title>Generative Models for Helmholtz Equation Solutions: A Dataset of Acoustic Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations. For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving. Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time, balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Lifted Training and Inversion Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms. This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations, and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies, including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods. Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems, detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g., unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks. Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training, particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-temporal CP decomposition analysis of New England region in the US</title>

Abstract: Spatio temporal data consist of measurement for one or more raster fields such as weather, traffic volume, crime rate, or disease incidents. Advances in modern technology have increased the number of available information for this type of data hence the rise of multidimensional data. In this paper we take advantage of the multidimensional structure of the data but also its temporal and spatial structure. In fact, we will be using the NCAR Climate Data Gateway website which provides data discovery and access services for global and regional climate model data. The daily values of total precipitation (prec), maximum (tmax), and minimum (tmin) temperature are combined to create a multidimensional data called tensor (a multidimensional array). In this paper, we propose a spatio temporal principal component analysis to initialize CP decomposition component. We take full advantage of the spatial and temporal structure of the data in the initialization step for cp component analysis. The performance of our method is tested via comparison with most popular initialization method. We also run a clustering analysis to further show the performance of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Synchrosqueezed windowed linear canonical transform: A method for mode retrieval from multicomponent signals with crossing instantaneous frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nature, signals often appear in the form of the superposition of multiple non-stationary signals. The overlap of signal components in the time-frequency domain poses a significant challenge for signal analysis. One approach to addressing this problem is to introduce an additional chirprate parameter and use the chirplet transform (CT) to elevate the two-dimensional time-frequency representation to a three-dimensional time-frequency-chirprate representation. From a certain point of view, the CT of a signal can be regarded as a windowed special linear canonical transform of that signal, undergoing a shift and a modulation.
  In this paper, we develop this idea to propose a novel windowed linear canonical transform (WLCT), which provides a new time-frequency-chirprate representation. We discuss four types of WLCTs. In addition, we use a special X-ray transform to further sharpen the time-frequency-chirprate representation. Furthermore, we derive the corresponding three-dimensional synchrosqueezed transform, demonstrating that the WLCTs have great potential for three-dimensional signal separation.</description>

      <title>Inequalities, identities, and bounds for divided differences of the exponential function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\exp[x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n]$ denote the divided difference of the exponential function.
  (i) We prove that exponential divided differences are log-submodular.
  (ii) We establish the four-point inequality $ \exp[a,a,b,c]\,\exp[d,d,b,c]+\exp[b,b,a,d]\,\exp[c,c,a,d]-\exp[a,b,c,d]^2 \ge 0 $ for all $ a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R} $.
  (iii) We obtain sharp two-sided bounds for $\exp[x_0,\dots,x_n]$ at fixed mean and variance; as a consequence, we derive their large-input asymptotics.
  (iv) We present closed-form identities for divided differences of the exponential function, including a convolution identity and summation formulas for repeated arguments.</description>

      <title>On the boundedness of dilation operators in the context of Triebel-Lizorkin-Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of dilation operators $ D_\lambda \colon f \mapsto f(\lambda\,\cdot) $ with $ \lambda &gt; 1 $ in the context of Triebel-Lizorkin-Morrey spaces $\mathcal{E}^{s}_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. For that purpose we prove upper and lower bounds for the operator (quasi-)norm $\| D_\lambda \,|\, \mathcal{L}\big(\mathcal{E}^s_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big) \| $. We show that for $s&gt;\sigma_p $ the operator (quasi-)norm $\| D_\lambda \,|\, \mathcal{L}\big(\mathcal{E}^s_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big) \| $ up to constants behaves as $\lambda^{s - \frac{d}{u}} $. For the borderline case $ s = \sigma_{p} $ we observe a behavior of the form $\lambda^{\sigma_p- \frac{d}{u}}$, multiplied with logarithmic terms of $\lambda$ that also depend on the fine index $q$. For $s &lt; \sigma_{p}$ and $p \geq 1$ we find the relation $\| D_\lambda \,|\, \mathcal{L}\big(\mathcal{E}^s_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big) \| \sim \lambda^{ - \frac{d}{u}}$. The case $s &lt; \sigma_{p}$ and $p &lt; 1$ is investigated as well. Our proofs are mainly based on the Fourier analytic approach to Triebel-Lizorkin-Morrey spaces. As byproducts we show an advanced Fourier multiplier theorem for band-limited functions in the context of Morrey spaces and derive some new equivalent (quasi-)norms and characterizations of $\mathcal{E}^{s}_{u,p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$.

      <title>Understanding the interplay of collagen and myocyte adaptation in cardiac volume overload: a multi-constituent growth and remodeling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hearts subjected to volume overload (VO) are prone to detrimental anatomical and functional changes in response to elevated mechanical stretches, ultimately leading to heart failure. Experimental findings increasingly emphasize that organ-scale changes following VO cannot be explained by myocyte growth alone, as traditionally proposed in the literature. Collagen degradation, in particular, has been associated with left ventricular adaptation in both acute and chronic stages of VO. These hypotheses remain to be substantiated by comprehensive mechanistic evidence, and the contribution of each constituent to myocardial growth and remodeling (G&amp;R) processes is yet to be quantified. In this work, we establish a hybrid G&amp;R framework in which we integrate a mixture-based constitutive model with the kinematic growth formulation. This multi-constituent model enables us to mechanistically assess the relative contributions of collagen and myocyte changes to alterations in tissue properties, ventricular dimensions, and growth phenotype. Our numerical results confirm that collagen dynamics control the passive mechanical response of the myocardium, whereas myocytes predominantly impact the extent and the phenotype of eccentric hypertrophy. Importantly, collagen degradation exacerbates myocyte hypertrophy, demonstrating a synergistic interplay that accelerates left ventricular progression toward diastolic dysfunction. This work constitutes an important step towards an integrated characterization of the early compensatory stages of VO-induced cardiac G&amp;R.</description>

      <title>Almost sure convergence rates of adaptive increasingly rare Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider adaptive increasingly rare Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which are adaptive MCMC methods, where the adaptation concerning the "past'' happens less and less frequently over time. Under a contraction assumption with respect to a Wasserstein-like function we deduce upper bounds of the convergence rate of Monte Carlo sums taking a renormalisation factor into account that is "almost'' the one that appears in a law of the iterated logarithm. We demonstrate the applicability of our results by considering different settings, among which are those of simultaneous geometric and uniform ergodicity. All proofs are carried out on an augmented state space, including the classical non-augmented setting as a special case. In contrast to other adaptive MCMC limit theory, some technical assumptions, like diminishing adaptation, are not needed.</description>

      <title>Composite B-Spline Regularized Delta Functions for the Immersed Boundary Method: Divergence-Free Interpolation and Gradient-Preserving Force Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to enhance volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method by using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. The conventional IB method, while effective for fluid-structure interaction applications, has long been challenged by poor volume conservation, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that composite B-spline regularized delta functions significantly enhance volume conservation through two complementary properties: they provide continuously divergence-free velocity interpolants and maintain the gradient character of forces corresponding to mean pressure jumps across interfaces. By correctly representing these forces as discrete gradients, they eliminate a key source of spurious flows that typically plague immersed boundary computations. Our approach maintains the local nature of the classical IB method, avoiding the computational overhead associated with the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves for interpolation and force spreading operations. We show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with errors in volume conservation dominated by truncation error of the time-stepping scheme. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems by slice sampling tensor completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of reduced order modeling for parametric dynamical systems using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD). In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Stability of instantaneous pressures in an Eulerian finite element method for moving boundary flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on identifying the cause and proposing a remedy for the problem of spurious pressure oscillations in a sharp-interface immersed boundary finite element method for incompressible flow problems in moving domains. The numerical method belongs to the class of Eulerian unfitted finite element methods. It employs a cutFEM discretization in space and a standard BDF time-stepping scheme, enabled by a discrete extension of the solution from the physical domain into the ambient space using ghost-penalty stabilization. To investigate the origin of spurious temporal pressure oscillations, we revisit a finite element stability analysis for the steady domain case and extend it to derive a stability estimate for the pressure in the $L^\infty(L^2)$-norm that is uniform with respect to discretization parameters. By identifying where the arguments fail in the context of a moving domain, we propose a variant of the method that ensures unconditional stability of the instantaneous pressure. As a result, the modified method eliminates spurious pressure oscillations. We also present extensive numerical studies aimed at illustrating our findings and exploring the effects of fluid viscosity, geometry approximation, mass conservation, discretization and stabilization parameters, and the choice of finite element spaces on the occurrence and magnitude of spurious temporal pressure oscillations. The results of the experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Transient Instability and Patterns of Reactivity in Diffusive-Chemotaxis Soil Carbon Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08757v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pattern formation in a chemotaxis model of bacteria and soil carbon dynamics as an example system where transient dynamics can give rise to pattern formation outside of Turing unstable regimes. We use a detailed analysis of the reactivity of the non-spatial and spatial dynamics, stability analyses, and numerical continuation to uncover detailed aspects of this system's pattern-forming potential. In addition to patterning in Turing unstable parameter regimes, reactivity of the spatial system can itself lead to a range of parameters where a spatially uniform state is asymptotically stable, but exhibits transient growth that can induce pattern formation. We show that this occurs in the bistable region of a subcritical Turing bifurcation. Intriguingly, such bistable regions appear in two spatial dimensions, but not in a one-dimensional domain, suggesting important interplays between geometry, transient growth, and the emergence of multistable patterns. We discuss the implications of our analysis for the bacterial soil organic carbon system, as well as for reaction-transport modeling more generally.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) preconditioner for the solution of three dimensional composite Discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of reaction-diffusion systems of ordinary and partial differential equations arising in cardiac cell-by-cell models like the Extracellular space, Membrane and Intracellular space (EMI) Model. These microscopic models are essential for the understanding of events in aging and structurally diseased hearts which macroscopic models relying on homogenized descriptions of the cardiac tissue, like Monodomain and Bidomain models, fail to adequately represent. The modeling of each individual cardiac cell results in discontinuous global solutions across cell boundaries, requiring the careful construction of dual and primal spaces for the BDDC preconditioner. We provide a scalable condition number bound for the precondition operator and validate the theoretical results with extensive numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents a complete research cycle comprising continuum-based modeling, computational framework development, and validation setup to predict phase separation and surface hydrodynamics in lipid bilayer membranes. We starting with an overview of the key physical characteristics of lipid bilayers, including their composition, mechanical properties, and thermodynamics, and then discuss continuum models of multi-component bilayers. The most complex model is a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard (NSCH) type system, describing the coupling of incompressible surface fluid dynamics with phase-field dynamics on arbitrarily curved geometries. It is discretized using trace finite element methods, which offer geometric flexibility and stability in representing surface PDEs. Numerical studies are conducted to examine physical features such as coarsening rates and interfacial dynamics. The computational results obtained from the NSCH model are compared against experimental data for membrane compositions with distinct phase behaviors, demonstrating that including both phase-field models and surface hydrodynamics is essential to accurately reproduce domain evolution observed in epi-fluorescence microscopy. Lastly, we extend the model to incorporate external forces that enable the simulation of vesicles containing cationic lipids, used to enhance membrane fusion.</description>

      <title>On the Schr\"odingerization method for linear non-unitary dynamics with optimal dependence on matrix queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schr\"odinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schr\"odinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schr\"odingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schr\"odingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</description>

      <title>Splitting-based randomized dynamical low-rank approximations for stiff matrix differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the fields of control theory and machine learning, the dynamic low-rank approximation for large-scale matrices has received substantial attention. Considering large-scale semilinear stiff matrix differential equations, we propose splitting-based randomized dynamical low-rank approximations for a low-rank solution of the stiff matrix differential equation. We first split such the equation into a stiff linear subproblem and a nonstiff nonlinear subproblem. Then, a low-rank exponential integrator is applied to the linear subproblem. Two randomized low-rank approaches are employed for the nonlinear subproblem. Furthermore, we extend the proposed methods to rank-adaptation scenarios. Through rigorous validation on canonical stiff matrix differential problems, including spatially discretized Allen-Cahn equations and differential Riccati equations, we demonstrate that our methods achieve desired convergence orders. Numerical results confirm the robustness and accuracy of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A direct PinT algorithm for higher-order nonlinear time-evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order nonlinear time-evolution equations have widespread applications in science and engineering, such as in solid mechanics, materials science, and fluid mechanics. This paper mainly studies a direct time-parallel algorithm for solving time-dependent differential equations of orders 1 to 3. Different from the traditional time-stepping approach, we directly solve the all-at-once system from higher-order evolution equations by diagonalization the time discretization matrix $B$. Based on the connection between the characteristic equation and Chebyshev polynomials, we give explicit formulas for the eigenvector matrix $V$ of $B$ and its inverse $V^{-1}$. We prove that $Cond_2\left( V \right) =\mathcal{O} \left( n^3 \right)$, where $n$ is the number of time steps. A direct parallel-in-time algorithm is designed by exploring the structure of the spectral decomposition of $B$. Numerical experiments are provided to show the significant computational speedup of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Recovery Performance of PhaseLift for Phase Retrieval from Coded Diffraction Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PhaseLift algorithm is an effective convex method for solving the phase retrieval problem from Fourier measurements with coded diffraction patterns (CDP). While exact reconstruction guarantees are well-established in the noiseless case, the stability of recovery under noise remains less well understood. In particular, when the measurements are corrupted by an additive noise vector $\vw \in \R^m$, existing recovery bounds scale on the order of $\norm{\vw}$, which is conjectured to be suboptimal. More recently, Soltanolkotabi conjectured that the optimal PhaseLift recovery bound should scale with the average noise magnitude, that is, on the order of $\norm{\vw}/\sqrt m$. However, establishing this theoretically is considerably more challenging and has remained an open problem. In this paper, we focus on this conjecture and prove that under adversarial noise, the recovery error of PhaseLift is bounded by $O\xkh{ \sqrt{\frac{\norm{\vw}\log n }{\sqrt m}}}\norm{\vx_0}$. Here, $\vx_0 \in \C^n$ is the signals we aim to recover. Moreover, for mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise vector $\vw \in \R^m$, a upper error bound and its corresponding minimax lower bound are also provided. Our results represent a significant step toward Soltanolkotabi's conjecture, offering new insights into the stability of PhaseLift under noisy CDP measurements.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Pushforward Samplers for Distributions from Fokker-Planck Equations by Weak Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for solving Fokker-Planck equations (FPE) by learning a neural sampler for the distribution given by the FPE via an adversarial training based on a weak formulation of the FPE where the adjoint operator of FPE acts on the test function. Such a weak formulation transforms the PDE solution problem into a Monte Carlo importance sampling problem where the FPE solution-distribution is learned through a neural pushforward map, avoiding some of the limitations of direct PDE based methods. Moreover, by using simple plane-wave test functions, derivatives on the test functions can be explicitly computed. This approach produces a natural importance sampling strategy for the FPE solution distribution with probability conservation, from which the FPE solution can be easily constructed.</description>

      <title>A derivative-free localized stochastic method for very high-dimensional semilinear parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mesh-free, derivative-free, matrix-free, and highly parallel localized stochastic method for high-dimensional semilinear parabolic PDEs. The efficiency of the proposed method is built upon four essential components: (i) a martingale formulation of the forward backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE); (ii) a small scale stochastic particle method for local linear regression (LLR); (iii) a decoupling strategy with a matrix-free solver for the weighted least-squares system used to compute $\nabla u$; (iv) a Newton iteration for solving the univariate nonlinear system in $u$. Unlike traditional deterministic methods that rely on global information, this localized computational scheme not only provides explicit pointwise evaluations of $u$ and $\nabla u$ but, more importantly, is naturally suited for parallelization across particles. In addition, the algorithm avoids the need for spatial meshes and global basis functions required by classical deterministic approaches, as well as the derivative-dependent and lengthy training procedures often encountered in machine learning. More importantly, we rigorously analyze the error bound of the proposed scheme, which is fully explicit in both the particle number $M$ and the time step size $\Delta t$. Numerical results conducted for problem dimensions ranging from $d=100$ to $d=10000$ consistently verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. Remarkably, all computations are carried out efficiently on a standard personal computer, without requiring any specialized hardware. These results confirm that the proposed method is built upon a principled design that not only extends the practically solvable range of ultra-high-dimensional PDEs but also maintains rigorous error control and ease of implementation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Convergence Rate of Lie-Trotter Approximation for Quantum Thermal Averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Codiscovering graphical structure and functional relationships within data: A Gaussian Process framework for connecting the dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most problems within and beyond the scientific domain can be framed into one of the following three levels of complexity of function approximation. Type 1: Approximate an unknown function given input/output data. Type 2: Consider a collection of variables and functions, some of which are unknown, indexed by the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph (a generalized graph where edges can connect more than two vertices). Given partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph (satisfying the functional dependencies imposed by its structure), approximate all the unobserved variables and unknown functions. Type 3: Expanding on Type 2, if the hypergraph structure itself is unknown, use partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph to discover its structure and approximate its unknown functions. These hypergraphs offer a natural platform for organizing, communicating, and processing computational knowledge. While most scientific problems can be framed as the data-driven discovery of unknown functions in a computational hypergraph whose structure is known (Type 2), many require the data-driven discovery of the structure (connectivity) of the hypergraph itself (Type 3). We introduce an interpretable Gaussian Process (GP) framework for such (Type 3) problems that does not require randomization of the data, access to or control over its sampling, or sparsity of the unknown functions in a known or learned basis. Its polynomial complexity, which contrasts sharply with the super-exponential complexity of causal inference methods, is enabled by the nonlinear ANOVA capabilities of GPs used as a sensing mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the construction and usage of mimetic operators in curvilinear staggered grids. Specifically, we extend the Corbino-Castillo operators so they can be utilized to solve problems in non-trivial geometries. We prove that the resulting curvilinear operators satisfy the discrete analog of the extended Gauss-Divergence theorem. In addition, we demonstrate energy and mass conservation in curvilinear coordinates for the acoustic wave equation. These findings are illustrated in two-dimensional and three-dimensional elliptic/hyperbolic equations and can be extended to other partial differential equations as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an original hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on a variational quantum algorithm for solving systems of differential equations. The algorithm relies on a spectral decomposition of the trial functions that are encoded directly in the quantum states generated by different parametrized circuits, and transforms the task of solving the differential equations into an optimization problem. We first describe the principle of the algorithm from a theoretical point of view. We provide a detailed pseudo-code of the algorithm, on which we elaborate preliminary elements for a complexity analysis to highlight some of its scaling properties. We apply our algorithm to a set of examples, running on emulators and real hardware showcasing its applicability across diverse sets of differential equations. We discuss the advantages of our method and potential avenues for further exploration and refinement.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a continuous-time formulation for the AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam optimization algorithms by modeling them as first-order integro-differential equations. We perform numerical simulations of these equations, along with stability and convergence analyses, to demonstrate their validity as accurate approximations of the original algorithms. Our results indicate a strong agreement between the behavior of the continuous-time models and the discrete implementations, thus providing a new perspective on the theoretical understanding of adaptive optimization methods.</description>

      <title>A Method for Establishing Asymptotically Accurate Bounds for Extremal Roots of Eulerian Polynomials Using Polynomial Stability Preservers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the tools to bound extreme roots of multivariate real zero polynomials globally. This is done through the use of a relaxation that approximates their rigidly convex sets. This relaxation can easily be constructed using the degree $3$ truncation of the polynomial and it produces in this way a spectrahedron whose computation is relatively easy and whose size is relatively small and depending solely on the number of variables of the polynomial. As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general spectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build matrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several constructions that could increase the size of these matrices. These constructions are based principally in two main approaches: adding information about higher degree monomials or non-trivially increasing the number of variables of the original polynomial. We explore these two construction first in a general setting and see that it is necessary to particularize to certain families of polynomials in order to make them work. In particular, we are able to prove that increasing the number of variables improves the behavior of the relaxation along the diagonal in the case of Eulerian polynomials. We see that applying the relaxation to multivariate Eulerian polynomials and then looking at the univariate polynomials injected in their diagonals produces an exponential asymptotic improvement in the bounds provided. We compare these bounds with other bounds that have appeared previously in the literature and refine these previous bounds in order to study how close do the bounds provided by the relaxation are to the actual roots of the univariate Eulerian polynomials.</description>

      <title>Approximation theory for 1-Lipschitz ResNets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 1-Lipschitz neural networks are fundamental for generative modelling, inverse problems, and robust classifiers. In this paper, we focus on 1-Lipschitz residual networks (ResNets) based on explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows and study their approximation capabilities. Leveraging the Restricted Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, we first show that these 1-Lipschitz ResNets are dense in the set of scalar 1-Lipschitz functions on any compact domain when width and depth are allowed to grow. We also show that these networks can exactly represent scalar piecewise affine 1-Lipschitz functions. We then prove a stronger statement: by inserting norm-constrained linear maps between the residual blocks, the same density holds when the hidden width is fixed. Because every layer obeys simple norm constraints, the resulting models can be trained with off-the-shelf optimisers. This paper provides the first universal approximation guarantees for 1-Lipschitz ResNets, laying a rigorous foundation for their practical use.</description>

      <title>Clean numerical simulation (CNS) of three-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by Orszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of numerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that turbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very sensitive to small disturbance. Thus, due to the famous butterfly-effect of chaos, unavoidable numerical noises of DNS might have great influence on spatiotemporal trajectories of turbulence. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov turbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than DNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS can greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required small level so that numerical noise can be rigorously negligible throughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In physics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence. Thus, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent Kolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with that given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal trajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are indeed badly polluted by numerical noise rather quickly, and besides the DNS result has significant deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the spatial symmetry of flow field and the energy cascade but also even in statistics.</description>

      <title>A generalized Hurwitz stability criterion via rectangular block Hankel matrices for nonmonic matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14376v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Hurwitz stability criterion for nonmonic matrix polynomials via column reduction, generalizing existing approaches constrained by the monic assumption and thus serving as a more natural extension of Gantmacher's classical stability criterion via Markov parameters. Starting from redefining the associated Markov parameters through a column-wise adaptive splitting method, our framework constructs two structured matrices whose rectangular Hankel blocks are obtained via the extraction of these parameters. We establish an explicit interrelation between the inertias of column reduced matrix polynomials and the derived structured matrices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hurwitz stability of column reduced matrix polynomials can be determined by the Hermitian positive definiteness of these rectangular block Hankel matrices.</description>

      <title>HYLU: Hybrid Parallel Sparse LU Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces HYLU, a hybrid parallel LU factorization-based general-purpose solver designed for efficiently solving sparse linear systems (Ax=b) on multi-core shared-memory architectures. The key technical feature of HYLU is the integration of hybrid numerical kernels so that it can adapt to various sparsity patterns of coefficient matrices. Tests on 34 sparse matrices from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection reveal that HYLU outperforms Intel MKL PARDISO in the numerical factorization phase by geometric means of 1.71X (for one-time solving) and 2.21X (for repeated solving). HYLU can be downloaded from https://github.com/chenxm1986/hylu.</description>

      <title>Overlapping Schwarz Scheme for Linear-Quadratic Programs in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimize-then-discretize framework for solving linear-quadratic optimal control problems (OCP) governed by time-inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our method employs a modified overlapping Schwarz decomposition based on the Pontryagin Minimum Principle, partitioning the temporal domain into overlapping intervals and independently solving Hamiltonian systems in continuous time. We demonstrate that the convergence is ensured by appropriately updating the boundary conditions of the individual Hamiltonian dynamics. The cornerstone of our analysis is to prove that the exponential decay of sensitivity (EDS) exhibited in discrete-time OCPs carries over to the continuous-time setting. Unlike the discretize-then-optimize approach, our method can flexibly incorporate different numerical integration methods for solving the resulting Hamiltonian two-point boundary-value subproblems, including adaptive-time integrators. A numerical experiment on a linear-quadratic OCP illustrates the practicality of our approach in broad scientific applications.</description>
