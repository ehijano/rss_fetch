      <title>Investigating the Efficacy of Topologically Derived Time Series for Flare Forecasting. II. XGBoost Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are a primary driver of space weather, and forecasting their occurrence remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel flare prediction model based on topologically derived photospheric magnetic parameters. We employ the \texttt{ARTop} framework to compute the time-dependent input rates of magnetic winding and helicity across more than $10^5$ active region (AR) observations, decomposing them into current-carrying and potential components to reduce sensitivity to optical flow methods. An \texttt{XGBoost} machine learning model is trained on these topological time series, alongside engineered features including rolling statistics, kurtosis, and flare history, to predict the probability of $\geq$M1.0-class flares within the next 24 hours. The model demonstrates strong performance on a validation set, with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.804 for once daily operational region forecasts. When applied to a fully independent holdout set, the operational forecast achieves a TSS of \tsssa. A SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirms the model's physical interpretability, identifying flare history and accumulated current-carrying winding and helicity as the most important features. The main challenges identified are false positives arising from ARs with frequent C-class flaring and systematic errors introduced by projection effects when ARs are near the limb. Excluding limb-affected data yields no improvement in the holdout set TSS (\TSSalert\ versus \tsssa), due to the overall decreased number of flares. However, our per-region analysis indicates that mitigating these projection effects is crucial for future operational deployment. This work establishes magnetic topology, particularly its current-carrying components, as a highly effective and physically meaningful set of predictors for solar flare forecasting.</description>

      <title>HOney-BeeS II. Be-X-ray binaries as testbeds for spectroscopic studies of Be stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of massive classical Be stars are thought to be binary interactions products. Their rapid rotation and often strong, variable, and emission-line dominated spectrum, make spectroscopic analysis challenging. Hence, robust binary properties and statistical constraints are still lacking for the Be population. In this study, we use seven Be-X-ray binaries, and their orbital periods derived from the X-rays, to investigate the reliability of different spectral lines and numerical methods for the measuring of radial-velocities and orbital period determination of Be stars. We use multi-epoch high-resolution HERMES spectra and compare absorption- and emission-line radial velocities obtained with cross-correlation, line-profile fitting, and the bisector method. Line-profile variability affects the bisector method and line-profile fitting requires model templates that do not encompass the complexity of Be-star line profiles. Therefore, we recommend using cross-correlation: it is independent of models and easily compatible with line blends seen in Be-star spectra. The obtained statistical uncertainty on the radial-velocities from cross-correlation is 0.2-0.3km/s for H$\alpha$ (emission) and ~5km/s for absorption lines, excluding potential systematics. In general, whether the goal is to do binary statistics of a population or an in-depth study of a specific system, we suggest using emission lines, due to a higher precision and less scatter than absorption lines. Here, H$\beta$ is preferred over H$\alpha$ because of its lesser variability. However, large-scale variability may cause large shifts in emission-line radial velocities, resulting in spurious eccentricities. In this case, orbital solutions should ideally be compared to lower-signal absorption lines (if present). Finally, we highlight the need for understanding how companion-disc interactions alter emission-line appearance.</description>

      <title>The Centennial Evolution of Solar Chromospheric Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation is a prominent feature of the Sun, and it plays a crucial role in the generation and dynamic evolution of solar magnetic fields. The daily composite time series of Ca II K plage areas from 1907 February 1 to 2023 December 31 is used to analyze its periodicity and examine the temporal variation of its rotation period lengths (RPLs) using continuous wavelet transform. Wavelet analysis reveals that over a time span of more than a century, chromospheric rotation exhibits a dominant synodic period of approximately 26.62 days, with complex temporal variations. The long-term trend of chromospheric rotation is well-characterized by a statistically significant quadratic polynomial, showing a gradual deceleration from solar cycles 15 to 19, followed by a gradual acceleration from cycles 19 to 24. The RPLs exhibit a negative correlation between the rotation rate of the chromosphere and solar magnetic activity. Their behavior follows a distinct pattern within a Schwabe cycle: the rotation period progressively lengthens during the initial approximately 3 years, then maintains a relatively long value from year 3 to approximately 7.5, and finally shortens during the declining phase, returning to a minimum near the subsequent solar minimum. The variations of chromospheric RPLs show significant periods of 3.2, 5.7, 7.7, 10.3, and 12.3 years, with cross-correlation analysis pointing to a complex relationship with solar activity. The possible mechanisms for the temporal variation of the chromospheric rotation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties of interplanetary coronal mass ejections at 1 AU and their connection to geoeffectiveness across solar cycles 23-25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of heliospheric variability and can produce prolonged disturbances near Earth. Understanding their thermodynamic evolution is crucial for assessing their heat budget and exploring how thermal states relate to their plasma dynamics and geoeffectiveness. We conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of magnetic ejecta (MEs) over Solar Cycles 23, 24, and the ascending phase of 25. Leveraging a polytropic framework, we characterized the thermal state of ME based on the event-wise median proton polytropic index (Gamma_p) from in-situ measurements at 1 AU. We find that MEs are thermodynamically active and rarely evolve adiabatically or isothermally. Notably, a significant fraction (45%) of MEs exhibit a heating state. Heating MEs dominate near solar maxima and exhibit strong solar-cycle modulation in Gamma_p, proton temperature, and expansion speed, indicating active in-transit heating processes. Whereas, Cooling MEs show a nearly constant Gamma_p = 2 across cycles, suggesting enhanced cooling beyond adiabatic expectations and possible thermal energy retention from eruption to 1 AU. Notably, the median Gamma_p value increases from 1.49 (SC23) to 1.88 (SC24), indicating a shift to cooling-dominated states over successive cycles. High-impact ICMEs, predominantly Heating MEs (Gamma_p = 0.59), often manifest as magnetic clouds with enhanced magnetic fields, low plasma beta, pronounced sheath compression, elevated expansion, and post-ICME high-speed flows, making them the most geoeffective drivers of strong geomagnetic storms. These results establish Gamma_p as a useful diagnostic of ICME thermal states, though meaningful assessment of geoeffectiveness requires combined consideration of thermal, plasma, and magnetic field properties.</description>

      <title>Discussion on the vanishment of solar atmospheric structures during magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection alters the topological connectivity, and magnetic energy is released. However, the length change of the reconnecting structures has rarely been reported. To identify the evolution of the topological structures, we search for reconnection events which should satisfy 3 criteria. (1) Each event displays an explicit X-type configuration, and the configuration consists of two sets of independent atmospheric structures, (2) the reconnection process is clearly observed, and (3) the topological connectivity of the structures can be tracked from at least 5 minutes prior to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection to 5 minutes after the reconnection. In this work, 3 events are selected and studied. During the reconnection moment, the total length of the two topological structures in each event shortens suddenly, and the decrements for events 1--3 are 47 Mm, 3.7 Mm, and 8.2 Mm, respectively, implying that partial structures vanish observationally during magnetic reconnection process. Several possibilities about the vanishment, e.g. the shrinkage of the reconnecting structures due to magnetic tension, the bizarre change in the third dimension, and magnetic field annihilation, have been discussed.</description>

      <title>XRISM view of a stellar flare: High-resolution Fe K spectra of HR 1099, an RS CVn-type star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observation was made of the RS CVn-type binary star HR 1099 using the Resolve instrument onboard XRISM for its calibration purposes. During the $\sim$400 ks telescope time covering 1.5 binary orbit, a flare lasting for $\sim$100 ks was observed with a released X-ray radiation energy of $\sim 10^{34}$ erg, making it the first stellar flare ever observed with an X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer. The flare peak count rate is 6.4 times higher than that in quiescence and is distinguished clearly in time thanks to the long telescope time. Many emission lines were detected in the 1.7--10 keV range both in the flare and quiescent phases. Using the high spectral resolution of Resolve in the Fe K band (6.5--7.0 keV), we resolved the inner-shell lines of Fe XIX--XXIV as well as the outer-shell lines of Fe XXV--XXVI. These lines have peaks in the contribution functions at different temperatures over a wide range, allowing us to construct the differential emission measure (DEM) distribution over the electron temperature of 1--10 keV (roughly 10--100 MK) based only on Fe lines, thus without an assumption of the elemental abundance. The reconstructed DEM has a bimodal distribution, and only the hotter component increased during the flare. The elemental abundance was derived based on the DEM distribution thus constructed. A significant abundance increase was observed during the flare for Ca and Fe, which are some of the elements with the lowest first ionization potential among those analyzed, but not for Si, S, and Ar. This behavior is seen in some giant solar flares and the present result is a clear example in stellar flares.</description>

      <title>Photometric and spectroscopic variability of blue supergiant \r{ho} Leo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars remains poorly understood, particularly for blue supergiants. These objects play a crucial role in the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies and exhibit pronounced photometric and spectroscopic variability, often quasi-periodic rather than strictly periodic.
  Aims. We investigate the variability of the evolved B-type star rho Leo to determine its physical properties, identify the underlying mechanisms driving its variability, and constrain its evolutionary stage.
  Methods. We analyse long-term spectroscopic and photometric datasets obtained from multiple sources, including the TESS and Kepler space missions and observations with the 1.5 m telescope in Estonia. Period analysis is performed using the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Lomb-Scargle pre-whitening, and the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform. Fundamental stellar parameters are derived by fitting synthetic line profiles computed with the FastWind code to the HARPS spectrum, while the stellar rotation inclination is estimated using the ZPEKTR code.
  Results. The He I 6678.151 A line shows significant radial-velocity and line-profile moment variations. We detect a set of periods and harmonics spanning approximately 0.8 to 35 days. Some periods remain stable over time, whereas others vary between observing seasons. A comparison of spectroscopic and photometric variability, together with phase-curve morphology, allows us to constrain the origin of several signals. In particular, the approximately 11 day period is attributed to stellar rotation, while the approximately 17 day period is linked to radial pulsations.
  Conclusions. Although the variability is quasi-periodic, most detected periods persist across multiple seasons. The wide range of timescales suggests that rho Leo is likely evolving along a blue loop following the red supergiant phase.</description>

      <title>The Gothard Observatory Synthetic Stellar Photometry Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In order to determine stellar luminosities and radii, it is necessary to know the total bolometric fluxes emitted by the stars, or equivalently the bolometric corrections (BCs) as accurately as possible.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to present and describe a new database of synthetic stellar magnitudes and bolometric corrections for 752 filters from 78 ground- and space-based instruments calculated using the most recent version of the BOSZ synthetic stellar spectral library.
  Methods. From the entire grid of the BOSZ theoretical spectra, our synthetic magnitudes in the Vega magnitude system were determined using the corresponding routines of the Python package species.
  Results. The database spans effective temperatures from 2800 to 16000~K, log g from $-0.5$ to 5.5, metallicities from $-2.5$ to 0.75, [$\alpha$/M] from $-0.25$ to 0.5, [C/M] from $-0.75$ to 0.5, and reddening up to $A_V$ = 3.1 mag. Using high-resolution (R = 50000) synthetic spectra allowed us to precisely track the effect of abundances on the bolometric corrections and luminosity of stars.
  Conclusions. By applying the new bolometric corrections (BCs) to 192\,000 APOGEE stars we calculated luminosities, and also demonstrated that neglecting carbon can introduce up to $\pm$0.2\% errors in luminosity. The new Gothard Observatory Synthetic Stellar Photometry Database may enable more accurate fundamental parameter determinations for large stellar samples using a vast amount of past, present, and upcoming surveys, such as Gaia, LSST, and the Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>A Machine-Learning Approach for Identifying CME-Associated Stellar Flares in TESS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of stellar space weather and can strongly influence the habitability of exoplanets. However, compared to the frequent occurrence of white-light flares, confirmed stellar CMEs remain extremely rare. Whether such flares are commonly accompanied by CMEs is a key question for solar-stellar comparative studies. Using Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray flare light curves observed by the GOES XRS 1--8~\AA\ channel, we compiled a sample of 1,766 M-class and larger solar flares and extracted features with both deep convolutional neural networks and manual methods. Five machine-learning classifiers were trained to distinguish eruptive from confined flares, with the random forest model achieving the best performance (true skill statistic; TSS = 0.31). This TSS value indicates that the model possesses a moderate ability to discriminate between eruptive and confined flares. Normalized white-light and GOES XRS flare light curves show broadly consistent temporal evolution, reflecting their shared energy-release history and supporting a probabilistic transfer of the model to white-light flare data. We applied the best-performing RF model to 41,405 TESS-detected flares on FGKM-type main-sequence stars, predicting that approximately 47% of events show CME-like morphological characteristics, with the model-implied intrinsic association fraction lying in the range 35%--60%. Intriguingly, the CME occurrence rate decreases with increasing flare energy, indicating that the most energetic flares may be more strongly confined by overlying magnetic fields. These results provide new insight into flare-CME connections in diverse stellar environments and have important implications for assessing the impact of stellar eruptive activity on exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Extensive Observational Evidence for Massive Star Stellar Wind Variability at Low Metallicities: implications for mass-loss rate determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass-loss from massive stars is fundamental to stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Reliable determination of mass-loss rate is dependent upon unravelling details of massive star outflows, including optical depth structure of the stellar wind. That parameter introduces significant uncertainty due to the nearly ubiquitous presence of large-scale optically thick wind structure. We utilize suitable available ultraviolet spectra of 20 Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC) OB stars to extend existing Galactic results quantifying uncertainty inherent in individual observations to lower metallicity environments. This is achieved by measuring standard deviations of mean optical depths of multiple observations of suitable wind-formed absorption profiles as a proportion of their mean optical depths. We confirm earlier findings that wind structure is prevalent at low metallicities and demonstrate that quantifying the consequent uncertainty is to some extent possible, despite the near-complete absence of time series UV spectroscopic observations in those environments. We find that the uncertainty inherent in any single observation of stellar wind optical depth at low metallicity is of similar magnitude to that already identified at Galactic metallicity (up to 45% for cooler OB stars). We further demonstrate how the effect of varying narrow absorption components in wind-formed UV spectral profiles is unlikely to be properly accounted for in existing mass-loss models. We present further evidence of a binary companion to the SMC O-type giant star AzV 75. The importance of obtaining high cadence multi-epoch, or genuine time series, UV spectroscopic observations at low metallicities is highlighted.</description>

      <title>RR Lyrae stars with variable mean magnitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A number of RR Lyrae stars show variable mean magnitudes in the OGLE survey light curves of the Galactic bulge. Hitherto this phenomenon was not studied, as it was generally assumed to be related to problems with the photometry. Aims. We investigate whether the mean magnitude variability of RR Lyrae variables is due to genuine astrophysical phenomena. Methods. We make use of the extended, and in many cases overlapping, light curves from multiple microlensing surveys, to study RR Lyrae stars with apparent mean-magnitude variations. A modified Fourier-series based fitting method is introduced to analyze the light curves showing mean-magnitude variations. Data from infrared surveys are also used to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Results. 72 stars are presented where the mean-magnitude variations are most probably of genuine astrophysical origin, and not the result of problems with the photometry. The ratio of variation between the V and I bands is compatible with variable extinction by dust in most cases, but no infrared excess is detected in the SEDs. The occurrence rate of the phenomenon, after correcting for selection effects, is $\sim0.9\%$ among RR Lyrae variables in the OGLE bulge fields.</description>

      <title>Eruption-Related Ultraviolet Irradiance Enhancements Associated with Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large solar flares (GOES M-class or higher) are usually associated with eruptions of material. However, when considering flare irradiance enhancements and dynamics such as chromospheric evaporation, potential contributions from erupted material have historically been neglected. We analyse nine eruptive M- and X-class flares from 2024 to early 2025, quantifying the relative contributions of erupted material to irradiance enhancements during the events. SDO/AIA images from four different channels had ribbon and eruption irradiance contributions separated using a semi-automated masking method. The sample-averaged percentages of excess radiated energy by erupted material over the impulsive phase were $10^{+4}_{-4}\%$, $24^{+14}_{-14}\%$, $21^{+14}_{-10}\%$ and $13^{+6}_{-9}\%$ for the $131\,$\r{A}, $171\,$\r{A}, $304\,$\r{A} and $1600\,$\r{A} channels, respectively. For three events that were studied in further detail, HXR imaging showed little to no signatures of nonthermal heating within the eruptions. Our results suggest that erupted material can be a significant contributor to UV irradiance enhancements during flares, with possible heating mechanisms including nonthermal particle heating, Ohmic heating, or dissipation of MHD waves. Future work may clarify the heating mechanism and evaluate the impact of eruptions on spectral variability, particularly in Sun-as-a-star and stellar flare observations.</description>

      <title>The Galactic White Dwarf Population</title>

Abstract: The ESA Gaia mission has revolutionized our understanding of the white dwarf population, delivering an unprecedented census of these nearby remnants and revealing previously unseen structures in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. However, while Gaia has expanded the scope of white dwarf astrophysics, it has also exposed new questions related to atmospheric composition, spectral evolution, crystallization, magnetism, and merger-driven pathways. Many of these open problems are encoded in the detailed morphology of the Gaia HR diagram, where precise spectroscopic characterization is essential for interpreting the underlying physical processes. Spectroscopic characterization, obtainable with current and future ESO facilities, can provide the effective temperatures and surface gravities that are required to derive accurate white dwarf masses, cooling ages, and luminosities. These fundamental parameters not only enable studies of spectral evolution, interior physics, and the origin of magnetic and high-mass white dwarfs, but also guarantee the construction of robust mass distributions and luminosity functions, essential for constraining the initial-to-final mass relation, probing the initial mass function, and reconstructing the star formation history of the local Galaxy, among other applications. Looking toward the 2040s, future multi-fiber spectrographs operating in survey mode on 10--15 meter class telescopes will be able to collect a complete spectroscopic sample of white dwarf, enabling the detailed characterization of their population. Achieving spectroscopic completeness for the nearby Galactic population and securing high signal-to-noise, moderate-to-high resolution spectra across the HR diagram with ESO instrumentation will be critical steps toward resolving these longstanding questions in white dwarf astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous and targeted mm/sub-mm transient searches with wide-FOV telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The millimeter/sub-millimeter (mm/sub-mm) sky remains a rich but under-explored frontier for transient and variable phenomena. A wide-field, high-sensitivity instrument with a large aperture and degree-scale field of view would open this regime, enabling both systematic survey monitoring and rapid-response follow-up. Key science opportunities include Galactic Plane monitoring and surveys to discover and characterize time-variable emission from young stellar objects, magnetically active and flaring stars, compact binaries, and explosive events, as well as prompt responses to multi-messenger alerts with large localization regions (e.g., gravitational-wave triggers). Multi-band capability, rapid slewing, and high sensitivity are essential to probe energetic processes such as jet launching, relativistic shocks and accretion flows in unprecedented detail. While long-term monitoring is well established at radio and optical/infrared wavelengths, mm/sub-mm observations uniquely bridge the spectral gap between these regimes, directly probing obscured environments that are inaccessible elsewhere. Large-scale monitoring programs will yield legacy datasets crucial for population studies through the 2040s and beyond.</description>

      <title>White Dwarfs in Wide Binary Systems as Reliable Age Calibrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deriving precise stellar ages is a challenging task. Consequently, age-dependent relations - such as the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relations of the Milky Way, or the age-rotation-activity relation of low-mass stars - are subject to potentially large uncertainties, despite the well-defined trends observed at the population level. White dwarfs, the most common stellar remnants, follow a relatively simple and well-understood cooling process. When found in wide binary systems with main-sequence companions, they can therefore provide the much-needed precise age estimates. The total age of such systems depends not only on the white dwarf cooling time but also on the lifetime of the main-sequence progenitor. Estimating this lifetime requires knowledge of the progenitor mass, which is typically inferred by adopting an initial-to-final mass relation. However, the observational constraints on this relation are still poorly defined, introducing a source of uncertainty in white dwarf age determinations. To mitigate this issue, we focus on a large sample of massive white dwarfs (&gt;~0.7 Msun), for which the main-sequence progenitor lifetime is negligible. These white dwarfs are intrinsically faint and therefore require specialized facilities for adequate follow-up observations. In this white paper, we outline the instrumentation requirements needed to observe the forthcoming population of massive white dwarfs in our Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Contrary to popular belief, the interstellar medium (ISM) is not empty; it is filled with atoms, dust particles, and molecules. Some of these molecules may have been the very building blocks of life that, delivered to Earth via comets and meteorites, could have given rise to Life itself. A large-area single-dish telescope with superb sensitivity, field-of-view and multi-band instruments will allow us to explore the limits of chemical complexity in the interstellar medium, across our Galaxy and in external galaxies, determining whether amino acids, sugars, or RNA/DNA nucleobases can form in space.</description>

      <title>The Future of Evolved Planetary Systems</title>

Abstract: Understanding the formation, evolution, and chemical diversity of exoplanets are now central areas of astrophysics research. White dwarfs provide a uniquely sensitive laboratory for studying the end stages of planetary-system evolution and for probing the bulk composition of both rocky and volatile-rich exoplanetary material. In the 2030s new facilities will transform our ability to carry out \textit{``industrial-scale''} astrophysics, leading to fundamental results and new challenges for the next decade. By combining the volume of data surveyed by the ESA {\em Gaia} mission and Vera C. Rubin Observatory with the next-generation of spectroscopic facilities, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) community will be in a position to obtain an unbiased census of evolved planetary systems, constrain the composition of thousands of disrupted planetesimals, and connect these signatures to Galactic populations and stellar birth environments. Thus, it is now the time for assessing those challenges and preparing for the future. This white paper outlines key science opportunities arising in the next decade and the technological requirements of future ESO facilities in enabling transformative discoveries in the 2040s. These future facilities will have to combine a number of features that are crucial for studying evolved planetary systems at white dwarfs, such as broad optical to near-infrared coverage, a high sensitivity at blue wavelengths, multi-resolution capability, massive multi-plexing, and time-domain reactivity.</description>

      <title>Sub-millimeter wavelength protostellar accretion rate monitoring with AtLAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How a star forms is a fundamental question in astrophysics. In the earliest stages of protostellar evolution high extinction prevents a direct study of the accretion processes and their temporal evolution. Monitoring the variations of the accretion luminosity in a large protostar sample over decades is needed to reveal how protostars accrete -- in major bursts or in a quasi-steady fashion. We here argue that a large ground based sub-millimeter single-dish facility with a wide FoV is required to fulfill this task.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake. How do Planetary Systems Form?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of protoplanets in protoplanetary disks around young stars is emerging as a transformative field that will redefine our understanding of how planetary systems form. While current facilities have revealed the diversity of mature exoplanets and the complex structures of disks, we still lack the crucial observational link between them: a statistically meaningful census of planets caught in the act of formation. This white paper argues that such a breakthrough requires access to the nearest and most informative star-forming regions, roughly half of which are poorly accessible or entirely unreachable from Cerro Armazones. Although the ELT alone will strongly impact our knowledge of planet formation, its location prevents Europe from fully exploiting the necessary parameter space. A 30-40 m telescope in the northern hemisphere is therefore essential for obtaining diffraction-limited imaging of protoplanets and disks across the entire sky, enabling robust demographics, exploiting synergies with ngVLA, Gaia, and other facilities covering the north, and ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of the planet-formation revolution in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Science Enabled by a 30-Meter-Class Telescope in the Northern Hemisphere: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are at the core of our observations of the Universe up to the reionization epoch, both through their intense ionizing fluxes and through the energetic end products that release fresh elements into the interstellar medium. Our interpretation of very high redshift galaxies and transient phenomena depends on knowledge derived from massive star populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, with characteristics that only remotely resemble the conditions in the early Universe. However, the models supporting these interpretations have been tested in a narrow range of environments and carry significant uncertainties when extrapolated. Advancing in our understanding of the Universe beyond the Local Volume therefore requires extending massive star studies to conditions representative of the early Universe. The next generation of telescopes has the potential to accomplish this goal.</description>

      <title>Why the northern hemisphere needs a 30-40 m telescope and the science at stake: Massive stars in spiral galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document discusses the three main lines expected to dominate massive-star research in the 2040s, namely: (1) The role of metallicity in stellar evolution, especially in determining the end products such as gravitational-wave progenitors. (2) The initial mass function from the most massive stars to substellar objects. (3) The role of the environment in the different modes of star formation from compact star clusters to born-this-way associations and from massive clusters to small stellar groups. More specifically, we present the contributions to such science that would be enabled by a 30~m type telescope in the northern hemisphere studying spiral galaxies. Those can be grouped in three: our own Galaxy, the Milky Way; the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group, M31 and M33; and other galaxies within 25 Mpc, such as M101, M51, and NGC~6946. This work is based on the fact that, as of today, no construction of a 30~m telescope has yet started in the northern hemisphere, so even in the best case scenario of such a hypothetical telescope, its full operation would not start until the late 2030s or early 2040s. It makes no assumptions about its location but supposes an instrumentation development similar to that of ELT.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Binaries: Probes of Future Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf binaries are fundamental astrophysical probes. They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Dynamical binary interactions in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical binary interactions such as common envelope (CE) evolution or stellar mergers are a critical phase in the formation of a wide variety of binary phenomena, ranging from blue stragglers to type I supernovae (of all flavours, a, b and c), $\gamma$-ray bursts to bipolar planetary nebulae, Thorne-Zytkow objects to X-ray binaries. In 2040s, the urgency of resolving long-standing questions regarding the physics behind the dynamical interaction stages and the absolute and relative frequencies of binary evolutionary pathways will only increase owing to rapidly expanding population statistics of gravitational wave events. Here, we argue that multi-wavelength observations (spectroscopy and photometry), linear spectropolarimetry, and interferometry of a large number of Luminous Red Novae, a particular class of transients associated with dynamical binary interactions, will provide unprecedented details about the underlying interaction physics. A breakthrough will be achieved by a tenfold or larger increase in identifications of transient-type events from interacting binaries and their follow-up with instrumentation that provides at least 10 times better angular resolution, 100 times better spectral resolution, and $\sim$100 times higher sensitivity than 2030s facilities.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington Chimneys: On the Cooling Evolution of Tidal Disruption Event Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of a compact accretion disk following a tidal disruption event (TDE) requires that the shocked stellar debris cool efficiently as it settles toward the black hole. While recent simulations suggest that stream dissipation occurs rapidly, how the weakly bound debris subsequently loses its thermal energy to assemble a compact disk near the circularization radius remains uncertain. We investigate this cooling process using axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of quasi-hydrostatic 'TDE envelopes', initialized with the total mass, angular momentum, and binding energy expected from a complete stellar disruption. The envelopes, supported by radiation pressure on large scales and rotation near the circularization radius, evolve through a combination of radiative diffusion, turbulent mixing, and polar outflows. In our fiducial model, a quasi-steady state is achieved in which a polar outflow radiates and expels matter at several times the Eddington luminosity. This enables the envelope to cool and contract, forming a dense, rotationally supported ring near the circularization radius, but on a timescale roughly ten times shorter than the naive photon-diffusion timescale. Comparative models without radiation transport confirm that cooling, not purely adiabatic evolution, is essential to driving this rapid inflow. Nevertheless, across a range of envelope masses, the effective envelope cooling time scales only weakly with its optical depth, implying that advective and wind-driven energy transport dominate over diffusion. Our results demonstrate the cooling-induced contraction, even absent viscosity and associated black hole accretion, can produce luminosities and large photosphere radii consistent with early UV/optical TDE emission. However, more quantitative light-curve predictions must incorporate self-consistent formation and feeding of the envelope by fall-back accretion.</description>

      <title>Exploiting tidal asteroseismology in binary populations from combined space photometry and time-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based photometry has substantially increased the number of pulsating stars found in binary systems by more than four orders of magnitude. Combined with high-resolution spectroscopy, high-precision photometry offers model-independent constraints on stellar parameters and internal processes. The advent of space-based photometric surveys has given us access to populations of tidally perturbed pulsators, which offer a unique and demanding set of constraints on tidal physics and stellar interiors. However, we lack the ability to undertake multi-epoch, high-resolution spectroscopy at large scale. The ability to obtain phase-resolved, high-resolution spectra would allow us to place precise, model-independent constraints on the stellar properties of pulsators in binary systems that will truly test our close binary asteroseismic modelling techniques, leading to much-needed constraints on fundamental stellar and binary physics. The need to properly cover the large parameter-space of binary stars demands a large-scale, population-level analysis in order to understand the complex landscape of binary stellar evolution. To enable this population-level analysis, we need a dedicated multi-fibre spectrograph (30--200 fibres) with high spectral resolution ($R\geq 50000$), high signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{S/N\geq 300}$), and a limiting magnitude of approximately 15. Such a spectrograph would be capable of efficiently resolving the pulsation variability on the order of minutes and orbit motion on the order of days to years for many targets.</description>

      <title>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transient of uncertain origin. Several hypotheses have been put forward which could feasibly be consistent with the sample number of events discovered thus far, including tidal disruption events around intermediate mass black holes, failed supernovae and mergers of stars with black holes. Whatever their origin, it is clear that better understanding LFBOTs will provide unique insight into the black hole formation/growth, central engine physics and transient-host galaxy interactions - themes which are expected to drive research in transient astronomy over the coming decades. The vast majority of LFBOTs are missed by current photometric surveys, or not efficiently selected for detailed follow-up. This white paper outlines the observing capabilities required on a 2040 timescale to maximise the discovery potential from these enigmatic events.</description>

      <title>Irradiation-Driven Formation of Supersoft X-ray Sources Following Classical Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are characterized by persistent thermonuclear burning on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WDs).The standard model requires high mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-7}\, {\rm M_{\odot}}\,yr^{-1}$ from massive companions, presenting a theoretical impediment to the observed short-period SSSs, whose orbital periods imply low-mass donors theoretically incapable of sustaining such accretion.To resolve this paradox,we propose and demonstrate through detailed simulations that irradiative feedback following a classical nova (CN) eruption provides a natural formation channel.Through detailed binary evolution simulations with MESA, we reveal that sustained WD irradiation initially from the outburst and subsequently from accretion luminosity triggers significant and stable expansion of the low mass companion.This,in turn,drives mass-transfer rates into the stable hydrogen-burning regime and sustains it beyond $10^4$ years after the initiation of hydrogen burning.This mechanism robustly explains the observed population of short-period SSSs. Moreover,when irradiation-driven mass transfer rate drops below the stable accretion rate,it may lead to the rapid accumulation of sufficient material on shorter time scales to trigger a recurrent nova outburst instead of SSS, thereby also offering an explanation for the origin of short-period recurrent novae.</description>

      <title>ALMA Band 7 Observations of Water Lines in the Protoplanetary Disk of V883 Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FU Orionis star V883 Ori provides a unique opportunity to probe the water snowline in a protoplanetary disk. During an accretion burst, the enhanced stellar luminosity heats the disk, sublimating ices and bringing volatile species into the gas-phase. The water snowline, located at $\sim$80 au in the midplane, represents a key boundary for dust growth and volatile delivery to forming planets. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of V883 Ori that detect two targeted water isotopologue transitions: para-H$_2$$^{18}$O $5_{1,5}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 322 GHz and HDO $3_{3,1}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 335 GHz. After correcting for Keplerian rotation, we detect HDO and H$_2$$^{18}$O at 23.6$\sigma$ and 9.3$\sigma$, respectively. Rotational-diagram analysis using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach yields $T_\mathrm{rot}=116.89\pm12.81$ K and $N=(4.90\pm1.69)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$_2$$^{18}$O, and $T_\mathrm{rot}=87.46\pm4.95$ K and $N=(4.47\pm0.62)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for HDO. These results imply water vapor abundances of $N_{\mathrm{H_2O}}/N_{\mathrm{H_2}}\sim3\times10^{-7}$-$5\times10^{-6}$ and an HDO/H$_2$O ratio of $(0.4$-$2.0)\times10^{-3}$ just inside the water snowline, broadly consistent with inheritance from protostellar envelopes. The HDO line in Band 7 is significantly weaker than predicted from Band 6 extrapolation, showing only $\sim$26% of the expected strength. This attenuation can be explained by a more compact, hotter emitting region with an effective radius of $\sim$53 au and/or frequency-dependent dust absorption that enlarges the apparent inner cavity at higher frequency. Our results highlight both the diagnostic power of water isotopologue lines and the need for higher angular resolution observations to resolve the water snowline and test these scenarios.</description>

      <title>The use of astronomical data for satellite tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study explored the usage of astronomical observations for the identification and tracking of artificial satellites. Spacecraft streaks on astronomical images are a growing issue for the astronomical community. The increasing number of satellites in the future will only worsen the situation for ground-based optical and radio observations of cosmic objects. In addition, the spacecraft passages often lead to the discarding of the obtained data. In this analysis, we propose an estimation of the usefulness of dedicated astronomical observation for spacecraft monitoring, identification, and deduction of orbital parameters. We use astronomical data from the Astronomical Observatory Meshtitsa (Bulgaria) and the https://www.tycho-tracker.com/ software for the streak analysis. The results are compared with well-known satellite databases, such as https://celestrak.org/. The findings are discussed in the framework of space weather research.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Collisional Outcomes Based on Impact Simulations of Mars-sized Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the outcomes of collisions between Mars-sized bodies through smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, focusing on the transitions among ``merging'', ``hit-and-run'', and catastrophic disruption. By systematically varying impact velocity, angle, and mass ratio, we characterize the dependence of collision outcomes on geometric and energetic parameters. A new analytic model is developed using characteristic energies -- particularly the energy deposited in overlapping regions of the colliding bodies -- to accurately describe the mass of the largest and second-largest remnants. The model successfully reproduces simulation results across a broad range of impact conditions and improves on previous models by better capturing the transitions between ``merging'', ``hit-and-run'', and disruption. We also derive outcome formulas averaged over impact-parameter-weighted angular distributions, enabling more realistic applications to integrated modeling of planet formation. The model further shows consistency with outcomes from dust aggregate collision simulations, highlighting its utility for modeling collisional processes not only for large planetesimals but also for smaller bodies.</description>

      <title>Expanding stellar horizons with polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarization of light is a critically under-utilized, rich source of information in astronomy. For stars in particular, surface magnetism polarization that can be detected and measured with spectro-polarimetry. Many questions about these surface fields remain unanswered due to a lack of dedicated instruments capable of probing weak and strong surface magnetic fields for the entire mass range of stars, from M-dwarfs (and even substellar objects) to massive O-type stars at different evolutionary stages and metallicities. These questions range from the origin of these fields to their true incidence rate throughout the stellar population and the dependence on metallicity. Magnetic fields, although currently often excluded from stellar evolution models, play an important role in stellar evolution. Connecting the surface fields to internal fields through asteroseismology will instigate a new era of understanding stellar evolution and the transport of angular momentum and chemical elements throughout stellar interiors, also impacting our understanding of star-planet interactions and stellar remnants. Polarimetry is also an under-utilized tool to observationally constrain the mode identification of nonradial oscillations, which lies at the basis of accurate asteroseismic parameter estimation at percentage-level for stellar radii, masses, ages, internal rotation, and magnetic field strengths. Combining strong constraints on mode identification and surface magnetic properties through the acquisition of time-resolved, high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N) spectro-polarimetry and spectroscopy promises to bring leaps forward in our understanding of stellar structure, particularly when combined with long-term space photometric data from past, current, and future missions.</description>

      <title>Magnetised turbulent plasmas as high-energy particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This proceedings paper reports on the theoretical modelling of particle acceleration in magnetised turbulent plasmas. It briefly reviews some recent findings obtained from fully kinetic numerical simulations of large-amplitude, semi to fully relativistic turbulence. The paper then argues that these findings can be understood within the framework of a ``generalised Fermi'' picture of stochastic acceleration, which it summarises. The dominant contributions to acceleration appear to arise from particle interactions with sharp, dynamic bends of the magnetic field lines and regions of velocity compression. Interestingly, the acceleration rate is spatially inhomogeneous and its probability distribution follows a broken power law extending up to large values. This makes relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence an extreme particle accelerator. Some implications for particle transport and the shape of the particle energy spectrum in the presence of radiative losses and over long timescales are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of JWST MIRI Detector Persistence and Implications for High-Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JWST MIRI detector exhibits a flux deficit persistence, but its timescales and impacts remain largely uncharacterized, particularly at the longest imaging wavelengths. In this study, we analyze full-field MIRI imager observations at 21 $\mu$m (F2100W) to quantify detector persistence following a saturation event by a bright (K = 5.65 mag) nearby (8.12 $\pm$ 0.04 pc) mid M-dwarf star, IRAS 21500+5903. Unlike typical persistence that appears as excess flux, this effect presents as a flux deficit in pixels previously illuminated by the saturating or near saturating source. We measure persistence at two post-saturation epochs: shortly after saturation (11.6 minutes) and an hour later (1.39 hours). Immediately after the saturation event, we detect a persistence level of $1.69 \pm 0.10$%. By fitting a Bayesian exponential decay model to the two epochs, we estimate that persistence decreases to one-tenth of its initial value after $5.16^{+1.49}_{-0.94}$ hours. We examine the implications of persistence for MIRI high-contrast imaging using the imager (not coronagraphy). Specifically, we discuss how MIRI detector persistence can produce false-positive exoplanet signals in direct imaging surveys, as well as degrade PSF subtraction, particularly at small inner working angles. We also outline mitigation strategies to avoid these impacts in future observations.</description>

      <title>Towards ALMA2040: An update from the European community and invitation to contribute</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure.
  To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility.
  In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way in motion: gauging stellar trajectories that shape the Galactic thin disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As stars traverse the Milky Way, their orbits evolve through perturbations that alter their orbital radii. These changes arise from two mechanisms: churning, which modifies angular momentum, and blurring, which induces eccentric orbits without major angular momentum change. To assess whether churning or blurring dominates the dynamical evolution of Gaia-ESO stars, we refine Galactic chemical-evolution models by constructing finer grids that span a wider age range. Using a generalised additive model (GAM), we estimate stellar birth radii beyond the limits of binned metallicity models and compare them with dynamical parameters derived from Gaia parallaxes and proper motions, and Galpy. Our metallicity-stratified sample, grouped through hierarchical clustering of 21 chemical abundances, reveals clear migratory signatures: metal-rich stars formed in the inner disc preferentially move outwards, while more metal-poor stars formed at larger radii tend to migrate inwards. About 75% of stars show signs of churning, while the remainder are largely undisturbed or shaped by blurring. These patterns vary among chemical groups, likely reflecting interactions with the Galactic bar and spiral arms.</description>

Abstract: SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric (typically 0.5$\sim$1 day) and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance (11.3$\pm$1.1 Mpc), metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. Nebular spectral modelling indicates a blueshifted O-rich clump moving toward observer, and the $[\text{OI}]/[\text{CaII}]$ line ratio suggests an intermediate-mass progenitor. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with $M_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.04\pm{0.01} M_{\odot}$ and a low ejecta mass of$M_{\mathrm{ej}} = 1.55^{+0.18}_{-0.14} M_{\odot}$. And the nebular-phase spectra and light-curve modelling both suggest that it most likely originated from an intermediate-mass binary progenitor system. The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Free Dynamics in Rotating Spherical Shell Convection Driven By Internal Heating and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest that diffusion-free dynamics are more readily obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for some bulk properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flows are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.</description>

      <title>Near-degeneracy effects in Quadrupolar Mixed Modes. From an Asymptotic Description to Data Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dipolar (l=1) mixed modes revealed surprisingly weak differential rotation between the core and the envelope of evolved solar-like stars. Quadrupolar (l=2) mixed modes also contain information on the internal dynamics, but are very rarely characterised due to their low amplitude and the challenging identification of adjacent or overlapping rotationally split multiplets affected by near-degeneracy effects. We aim to extend broadly used asymptotic seismic diagnostics beyond l=1 mixed modes by developing an analogue asymptotic description of l=2 mixed modes, explicitly accounting for near-degeneracy effects that distort their rotational multiplets. We derive a new asymptotic formulation of near-degenerate mixed l=2 modes that describes off-diagonal terms representing the interaction between modes of adjacent radial orders. We implement the formalism within a global Bayesian mode-fitting framework, for a direct fit of all l=0,1,2 modes in the power spectrum density. We are able to asymptotically model the asymmetric rotational splitting present in various radial orders of l=2 modes observed in young red giant stars without the need for any numerical stellar modelling. Applied to the Kepler target KIC 7341231, our formalism yields core and envelope rotation rates consistent with previous numerical modelling, while providing improved constraints from the global and model-independent approach. We also characterise the new target KIC 8179973, measuring its rotation rate and mixed-mode parameters for the first time. The global fit allows for much better precision than standard methods, yielding better constraints for rotation inversions. We place the first observational constraints on the asymptotic l=2 mixed mode parameters (DPi_2,q_2,eps_g2), paving the way towards the use of asymptotic seismology beyond l=1 mixed modes.</description>

      <title>Rapid formation of a very massive star &gt;50000 $M_\odot$ and subsequently an IMBH from runaway collisions. Direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using \textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86 \times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\mathrm{pc}$.
  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.
  Methods. We use both direct \textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement.
  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding $5 \times 10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH.
  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from beyond the light cylinder in millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in emission. We devise a technique for determining "disjoint" from "contiguous" components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder (LC), co-located with gamma-ray emission. For some of the radio MSPs only the LC emission is being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of LC emission and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be determined. The LC components have frequently very high polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. In this picture, the number of potentially detectable radio MSPs is higher than previously thought, although the actual detectability of LC components depends on their luminosity function. A mechanism is required to produce coherent radio emission far from the stellar surface. These ideas have implications for our understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and may have implications for the long-term timing stability of some of these sources.</description>

      <title>The observation of Ground Level Enhancement GLE 77 by the neutron detectors of the Experimental Complex NEVOD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Ground Level Enhancement event was observed by neutron detectors designed for the registration of extensive air showers at the Experimental Complex NEVOD. The potential for that was unlocked by a recent modernization of the experimental setup that included implementation of additional channels for measuring neutron flux variation. At 10:15 UT on November 11, 2025, a sudden and significant increase in the neutron flux was detected by two installations: PRISMA-36 and URAN arrays. For the first time, a GLE has been recorded using a set of neutron detectors oriented at the extensive air shower studies. We present the measured EC NEVOD data and the results of the preliminary analysis of the observed GLE.</description>
