      <title>Rank-Guaranteed Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a combinatorial ascending auction that is "approximately" optimal, requiring minimal rationality to achieve this level of optimality, and is robust to strategic and distributional uncertainties. Specifically, the auction is rank-guaranteed, meaning that for any menu M and any valuation profile, the ex-post revenue is guaranteed to be at least as high as the highest revenue achievable from feasible allocations, taking the (|M|+ 1)th-highest valuation for each bundle as the price. Our analysis highlights a crucial aspect of combinatorial auction design, namely, the design of menus. We provide simple and approximately optimal menus in various settings.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Auctions without a Numeraire: The Case of Blockchain Trade-Intent Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain trade intent auctions currently intermediate approximately USD 5 billion monthly. Due to production complementarities, the auction is combinatorial: when multiple trade intents from different traders are auctioned off simultaneously, a bidder (here called solver) can generate additional efficiencies by winning a batch of multiple trade intents. However, unlike other combinatorial auctions studied in the literature, the auction has no numeraire. Fairness is a concern as the efficiencies from batching cannot be easily shared between traders. We formalize this problem and study the most commonly used auction formats: batch auctions and multiple simultaneous auctions. We also propose a novel fair combinatorial auction that combines batch auction and multiple simultaneous auctions: solvers submit individual-trade bids and batched bids, but batched bids are considered only if they are better for all traders relative to the outcome of multiple simultaneous auctions (constructed using the individual-trade bids). We find a trade-off between the fairness guarantees provided by the auction (i.e., the minimum each trader can expect to receive) and the expected value of the assets returned to the traders. Also, the amount that each trader receives in the equilibrium of the fair combinatorial auction may be higher or lower than what they receive in the equilibrium of the simultaneous auctions used as a benchmark for fairness.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing for Real Estate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model for the optimization of the price of real estate (RE). This model can be characterised by a limited amount of goods, fixed sales horizon and presence of intermediate sales and revenue goals. We develop it as an enhancement and upgrade of the model presented by Besbes and Maglaras now also taking into account variable demand, time value of money, and growth of the objective value of Real Estate with the development stage.</description>

      <title>Information Acquisition and Time-Risk Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.05120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An agent acquires information dynamically until her belief about a binary state reaches an upper or lower threshold. She can choose any signal process subject to a constraint on the rate of entropy reduction. Strategies are ordered by "time risk"-the dispersion of the distribution of threshold-hitting times. We construct a strategy maximizing time risk (Greedy Exploitation) and one minimizing it (Pure Accumulation). Under either strategy, beliefs follow a compensated Poisson process. In the former, beliefs jump to the threshold that is closer in Bregman divergence. In the latter, beliefs jump to the unique point with the same entropy as the current belief.</description>

      <title>Persuasion and Optimal Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unified analysis of how dynamic information should be designed in optimal stopping problems: a principal controls the flow of information about a payoff relevant state to persuade an agent to stop at the right time, in the right state, and choose the right action. We further show that for arbitrary preferences, intertemporal commitment is unnecessary: optimal dynamic information designs can always be made dynamically consistent.</description>

      <title>Fair Division with Two-Sided Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a fair division setting in which participants are to be fairly distributed among teams, where not only do the teams have preferences over the participants as in the canonical fair division setting, but the participants also have preferences over the teams. We focus on guaranteeing envy-freeness up to one participant (EF1) for the teams together with a stability condition for both sides. We show that an allocation satisfying EF1, swap stability, and individual stability always exists and can be computed in polynomial time, even when teams may have positive or negative values for participants. When teams have nonnegative values for participants, we prove that an EF1 and Pareto optimal allocation exists and, if the valuations are binary, can be found in polynomial time. We also show that an EF1 and justified envy-free allocation does not necessarily exist, and deciding whether such an allocation exists is computationally difficult.</description>

      <title>Stake-governed tug-of-war and the biased infinity Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In tug-of-war, two players compete by moving a counter along edges of a graph, each winning the right to move at a given turn according to the flip of a possibly biased coin. The game ends when the counter reaches the boundary, a fixed subset of the vertices, at which point one player pays the other an amount determined by the boundary vertex. Economists and mathematicians have independently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on resource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend precious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine the turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias game in a Euclidean setting.
  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war games with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget which she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each turn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the sum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary being the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a single distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique Nash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any given turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been placed. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained at its initial value $\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic function; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given turn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\lambda$-derivative of game value. We also indicate examples in which the solution takes a different form in the non-leisurely game.</description>
