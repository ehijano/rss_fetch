      <title>Ion Optics for quasi-free $(p,p\alpha)$ reactions with Grand Raiden Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-free $(p,p\alpha)$ reaction is a powerful tool to probe preformed $\alpha$ clusters in nuclei, but it requires accurate reconstruction of both momentum and scattering angles at the reaction point. In this work, ion-optical analysis for $(p,p\alpha)$ measurements with the Grand Raiden spectrometer is presented. An under-focus optical setting was adopted to preserve sensitivity to the vertical scattering angle while maintaining high momentum resolution. The focal-plane geometry was determined independently as a purely geometrical reference. Momentum calibration was performed using elastic scattering of $^{206}$Pb$(p,p)$ at a fixed spectrometer angle. Scattering angles were reconstructed using ion-optical relations, and residual higher-order effects were corrected by a multidimensional fit. The dominant contributions to the reconstruction were found to arise from terms up to third order within the experimental acceptance. This ion-optical framework enables consistent event-by-event reconstruction of the reaction kinematics and provides a reliable basis for quasi-free $(p,p\alpha)$ analyses.</description>

      <title>Autonomous battery research: Principles of heuristic operando experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unravelling the complex processes governing battery degradation is critical to the energy transition, yet the efficacy of operando characterisation is severely constrained by a lack of Reliability, Representativeness, and Reproducibility (the 3Rs). Current methods rely on bespoke hardware and passive, pre-programmed methodologies that are ill-equipped to capture stochastic failure events. Here, using the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's multi-modal toolkit as a case study, we expose the systemic inability of conventional experiments to capture transient phenomena like dendrite initiation. To address this, we propose Heuristic Operando experiments: a framework where an AI pilot leverages physics-based digital twins to actively steer the beamline to predict and deterministically capture these rare events. Distinct from uncertainty-driven active learning, this proactive search anticipates failure precursors, redefining experimental efficiency via an entropy-based metric that prioritises scientific insight per photon, neutron, or muon. By focusing measurements only on mechanistically decisive moments, this framework simultaneously mitigates beam damage and drastically reduces data redundancy. When integrated with FAIR data principles, this approach serves as a blueprint for the trusted autonomous battery laboratories of the future.</description>

      <title>Identification and online monitoring of experimental measurement states via Cuscore statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical method for detecting and analysing state changes in experimental measurements using the Cuscore statistic and its special case, the Centred Cuscore statistic. These statistics are designed to identify deviations in detector responses using sequential hypothesis testing relative to a defined reference state. Applications to charge-changing reaction experiments at the FRagment Separator facility at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, Germany, and the Second Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou at the Institute of Modern Physics, China, demonstrate the ability of these tools to quantify state changes, identify the change point, and classify data segments based on measured states. For long-term online monitoring, we use the exponentially weighted moving average to continuously update computations, enabling the detection of successive changes. This method supports both real-time and post-experiment diagnostics and provides a robust approach for enhancing data integrity and experimental control in nuclear physics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Robust Lifetime Estimation from HPGe Radiation-Sensor Time Series Using Pairwise Ratios and MFV Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray detectors are core instruments in nuclear physics and astrophysics experiments, where long-term stability and reliable extraction of decay parameters are essential. However, the standard exponential decay analyses of the detector time-series data are often affected by the strong correlations between the fitted parameters and the sensitivity to detector-related fluctuations and outliers. In this study, we present a robust analysis framework for HPGe detector decay data based on pairwise ratios and the Steiner's most frequent value (MFV) statistic. By forming point-to-point ratios of background-subtracted net counts, the dependence on the absolute detector response is eliminated, removing the amplitude-lifetime correlation inherent to conventional regression. The resulting pairwise lifetime estimates exhibit heavy-tailed behavior, which is efficiently summarized using the MFV, a robust estimator designed for such distributions. For the case study, a long and stable dataset from an HPGe detector was used. This data was gathered during a low-temperature nuclear physics experiment focused on observing the 216 keV gamma-ray line in 97-Ru. Using measurements spanning approximately 10 half-lives, we obtain a mean lifetime of tau = 4.0959 +/- 0.0007 (stat) +/- 0.0110 (syst) d, corresponding to a half-life of T1/2 = 2.8391 +/- 0.0005 (stat) +/- 0.0076 (syst) d. These results demonstrate that the pairwise-MFV approach provides a robust and reproducible tool for analyzing long-duration HPGe detector data in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics experiments, particularly for precision decay measurements, detector-stability studies, and low-background monitoring.</description>

      <title>High-Pressure Reinforced Vessel, produced by Additive Manufacturing, to be used as a gas target for the measurement program at n_TOF -- Multiple Argon Experiments (MArEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The n_TOF collaboration has expressed interest in developing transmission experiments with liquid argon (LAr) and gaseous argon (GAr) to improve the understanding of neutron propagation and capture in Ar. This topic is relevant to both nuclear and particle physics, as LAr is widely used in neutrino experiments, dark matter searches and other applications. Despite its widespread use, neutron interactions on Ar are still poorly characterized. In this context, the Multiple Argon Experiments (MArEX) initiative aims to address these gaps by providing detailed measurements of neutron and Ar interactions, including resolved resonance parameters and radiative capture widths, across an unprecedented energy range from 1 eV to 200 MeV. As part of MArEX research activities, this paper presents the development of an innovative High-Pressure Reinforced Vessel (HPRV) for GAr targets, produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) and reinforced with carbon fibre (CF). The experimental results confirmed the capability of the vessel to withstand high operating pressure without any issues and the capability of the Multi-layers Finite Element Model (MLs-FEM) to simulate and predict the stress behaviour and the operation limit of the vessel.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the CYGNO Gaseous TPC Optical Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaseous Time Projection Chambers with Optical Readout are sensitive detectors suitable for 3D measurement of low-energy O(1 keV) particles and are proposed for detecting rare events such as Dark Matter particle interactions. The CYGNO collaboration is developing such a detector with a high spatial and energy resolution, leveraging an innovative optical readout system. A reliable simulation of the detector response is needed to properly assess the physics reach of this technique and to better understand the performance of the detector in the development phase. Such a simulation cannot entirely rely on existing software packages; indeed, none of the available tools is capable of properly and reliably treating the different phenomena occurring in the detector, from the primary interaction in the gas volume throughout the whole detector response model, including charge transport, light production and propagation, and the response of the optical sensors. In this paper, we present a modeling of the detector response tuned on the CYGNO Optical TPC case; a description of the method is reported together with comparisons with experimental data from the LIME prototype to demonstrate the simulation performances.</description>

      <title>Ion Temperature Inference from Neutron Counting in Maxwellian Deuterium Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is presented for inferring the deuterium fuel ion temperature from neutron counts measured with fast liquid scintillators in conditions where the ion velocity distribution is Maxwellian. Local neutron count rates at each scintillator position are combined to estimate total neutron yield from the plasma, where absolute detection efficiency is determined via MCNP neutron scattering simulation based on a 3D model of the experiment structure. This method is particularly advantageous for Magnetized Target Fusion applications as it yields a time-resolved diagnostic and does not require direct line-of-sight to the plasma or collimation of the neutrons. The instrumentation configuration, pulse-shape discrimination and pile-up correction algorithms, detector calibration, and ion temperature calculation method with uncertainty characterization are discussed. An application of the method to General Fusion's Plasma Injector~3 (PI3) spherical tokamak device is demonstrated and the results are compared to an Ion Doppler spectroscopy ion temperature diagnostic.</description>

      <title>Common Iron Passive Magnetic Shielding for Scintillator Array Photomultiplier Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In accelerator-based experiments, detector arrays constructed from organic plastic scintillators are widely used for measurements of particle timing, hit position, and energy loss. These detectors are often operated in proximity to magnetic spectrometers, where the associated photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are exposed to fringe magnetic fields. The standard approach to mitigate magnetic interference involves individually shielding each PMT. In this work, we present a combined passive shielding solution consisting of a common iron enclosure for a row of PMTs, supplemented with individual mu-metal cylinders. This configuration was deployed during a 2022 experiment at JINR. Performance evaluations show that the proposed shielding effectively preserves PMT gain and timing resolution, demonstrating its viability for future applications in similar experimental environments.</description>

      <title>Detection of MEMS Acoustics via Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have traditionally addressed vastly different length scales - one resolving atoms, the other engineering macroscopic motion. Here we unite these two fields to perform minimally invasive-measurements of high aspect-ratio MEMS resonators using the STM tip as both actuator and detector. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, we resolve acoustic modes of millimeter-scale, high-Q membranes with picometer spatial precision, without making use of lasers or capacitive coupling. The tunneling junction introduces negligible back-action or heating, enabling direct access to the intrinsic dynamics of microgram-mass oscillators. In this work we explore three different measurement modalities, each offering unique advantages. Combined, they provide a pathway to quantum-level readout and exquisite high-precision measurements of forces, displacements, and pressures at cryogenic conditions. This technique provides a general platform for minimally-perturbative detection across a wide range of nanomechanical and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on Long-Range Neutrino Interactions using IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first search for new flavor-dependent long-range interactions (LRI) of neutrinos using publicly available 8 years of high-purity $\nu_\mu$ CC data from IceCube DeepCore. These interactions are mediated by ultra-light gauge bosons with masses below $10^{-10}$ eV, which can arise due to a new lepton-number gauge symmetry, such as $L_e - L_\mu$ or $L_e - L_\tau$. These long-range interactions induce matter potential between neutrinos and abundant electrons present in distant astrophysical sources. These LRI potentials could modify neutrino oscillation probabilities. By probing the effects of LRI on atmospheric neutrino oscillations at IceCube DeepCore, we place world-leading constraints on the coupling strength of these interactions.</description>

      <title>CRYSP: a Total-Body PET based on cryogenic cesium iodide crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have the potential to substantially reduce both acquisition time and administered radiation dose, owing to their high sensitivity. However, their widespread clinical adoption is hindered by the high cost of currently available systems. This work explores the use of pure cesium iodide (CsI) monolithic crystals operated at cryogenic temperatures as a cost-effective alternative to rare-earth scintillators for TBPET. We investigate the performance of pure CsI crystals operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K), where they achieve a light yield of approximately $10^5$ photons/MeV. The implications for energy resolution, spatial resolution (including depth-of-interaction capability), and timing performance are assessed, with a view toward their integration into a TBPET system. Cryogenic CsI crystals demonstrated energy resolution below 7% and coincidence time resolution at the nanosecond level, despite their relatively slow scintillation decay time. A Monte Carlo simulation of monolithic CsI crystals shows that a millimeter-scale spatial resolution in all three dimensions can be obtained. These characteristics indicate that high-performance PET imaging is achievable with this technology. A TBPET scanner based on cryogenic CsI monolithic crystals could combine excellent imaging performance with significantly reduced detector costs, enabling broader accessibility and accelerating the adoption of TBPET in both clinical and research settings.</description>

Abstract: Carbon is fundamental to science and technology due to its diverse bonding configurations, structural versatility, and essential role in defining the mechanical, chemical, electronic, and quantum properties of materials. However, direct three-dimensional (3D) imaging of individual carbon atoms remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we use twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as a model system and demonstrate ptychographic atomic electron tomography (pAET) for determining the 3D atomic coordinates of individual carbon atoms with a precision of 0.11 angstrom. The resulting 3D atomic model uncovers chiral lattice distortions driven by van der Waals interactions that exhibit meron-like and skyrmion-like structural textures. These findings provide direct insight into the interplay between 3D chiral lattice deformation and electronic properties in moire-engineered carbon systems. Beyond TBG, pAET offers a versatile approach for 3D atomic-scale imaging of carbon-based and other light-element materials that are central to advances in physics, chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology.</description>
