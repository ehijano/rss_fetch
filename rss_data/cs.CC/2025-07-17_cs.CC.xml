      <title>Searching for Falsified Clause in Random (log n)-CNFs is Hard for Randomized Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a randomly sampled unsatisfiable $O(\log n)$-CNF over $n$ variables the randomized two-party communication cost of finding a clause falsified by the given variable assignment is linear in $n$.</description>

      <title>Which graph motif parameters count?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed graph H, the function #IndSub(H,*) maps graphs G to the count of induced H-copies in G; this function obviously "counts something" in that it has a combinatorial interpretation. Linear combinations of such functions are called graph motif parameters and have recently received significant attention in counting complexity after a seminal paper by Curticapean, Dell and Marx (STOC'17). We show that, among linear combinations of functions #IndSub(H,*) involving only graphs H without isolated vertices, precisely those with positive integer coefficients maintain a combinatorial interpretation. It is important to note that graph motif parameters can be nonnegative for all inputs G, even when some coefficients are negative.
  Formally, we show that evaluating any graph motif parameter with a negative coefficient is impossible in an oracle variant of #P, where an implicit graph is accessed by oracle queries. Our proof follows the classification of the relativizing closure properties of #P by Hertrampf, Vollmer, and Wagner (SCT'95) and the framework developed by Ikenmeyer and Pak (STOC'22), but our application of the required Ramsey theorem turns out to be more subtle, as graphs do not have the required Ramsey property.
  Our techniques generalize from graphs to relational structures, including colored graphs. Vastly generalizing this, we introduce motif parameters over categories that count occurrences of sub-objects in the category. We then prove a general dichotomy theorem that characterizes which such parameters have a combinatorial interpretation. Using known results in Ramsey theory for categories, we obtain a dichotomy for motif parameters of finite vector spaces as well as parameter sets.</description>

      <title>Graph Local Complementation is Inherently Sequential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local complementation of a graph $G$ on vertex $v$ is an operation that results in a new graph $G*v$, where the neighborhood of $v$ is complemented. This operation has been widely studied in graph theory and quantum computing.
  This article introduces the Local Complementation Problem, a decision problem that captures the complexity of applying a sequence of local complementations. Given a graph $G$, a sequence of vertices $s$, and a pair of vertices $u,v$, the problem asks whether the edge $(u,v)$ is present in the graph obtained after applying local complementations according to $s$. The main contribution of this work is proving that this problem is $\mathsf{P}$-complete, implying that computing a sequence of local complementation is unlikely to be efficiently parallelizable. The proof is based on a reduction from the Circuit Value Problem, a well-known $\mathsf{P}$-complete problem, by simulating circuits through local complementations.
  Additionally, the complexity of this problem is analyzed under different restrictions. In particular, it is shown that for complete and star graphs, the problem belongs to $\mathsf{LOGSPACE}$. Finally, it is conjectured that the problem remains $\mathsf{P}$-complete for the class of circle graphs.</description>
