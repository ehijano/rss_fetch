      <title>High precision measurement of phi-nucleon cross section using a tensor polarized deuteron target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to measure the $\phi$-nucleon cross section $\sigma_{\phi N}$ to solve the longstanding puzzle of whether $\sigma_{\phi N} \simeq 10$ mb, as extracted from photoproduction, or $\sim$30 mb, as obtained from nuclear rescattering. CLAS data demonstrated that even precision data for unpolarized $\phi$ photoproduction are insufficient to unambiguously extract $\sigma_{\phi N}$, allowing the possibilities of both $\sigma_{\phi N}$ values. However, as it often happens, the additional spin degrees of freedom afforded by a polarized target sufficiently constrains the theory to unambiguously provide $\sigma_{\phi N}$. This will be accomplished with a measurement of the tensor asymmetry $A_{zz}$ in coherent $\phi$ photoproduction from the deuteron, $\gamma + d \to \phi + d$. The same measurement in coherent $\rho$ photoproduction will allow us to understand the kinematic dependence of the photon longitudinal interaction length for this process, which is necessary to identify unambiguous signal for color transparency. This will be the first study of observables in photoproduction from tensor polarized deuterons. We will use the standard GlueX spectrometer, the Hall D Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) polarized target, and both a circularly and linearly polarized tagged photon beam. The ability to operate the target in a frozen spin mode and produce negative tensor-polarization will decrease the time needed to make the measurements by a factor of more than 2.5. We request 65 days of beam time which includes commissioning the tensor polarized target.</description>

      <title>Space-time Areas and Hadronization Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-time area laws play a fundamental role in modeling strongly interacting phenomena, such as in relativistic string models, QCD on the lattice, and in hadronization modeling. For the latter, an exact expression for relevant space-time areas related to the final state hadronic events for hadrons of any mass is calculated. Usage of this expression in the UCLA hadronization model helps validate its space-time area law (STAL) principle and unifies the treatment of heavy and light hadrons via a single fragmentation function.</description>

      <title>Detecting Traces of Light-Quark Yukawa Couplings to the Higgs Boson in Fragmentation Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that Yukawa interactions of light quarks with the Higgs boson are imprinted as unique azimuthal modulations in the density of fragmentation hadrons relative to the Higgs $p_T$. We introduce Yukawa Fragmentation Asymmetries (YFAs), interference observables that are linearly proportional to real (Standard Model) or CP-odd Yukawa couplings, respectively. The chiral suppression is lifted nonperturbatively by chiral-odd multi-hadron fragmentation functions. As a case study, we consider $VH$ production with a tagged target fragmentation hadron at the HL-LHC. We estimate that the YFAs from this single example process are already competitive with current projected HL-LHC sensitivities for second-generation couplings, and outperform them by a factor of 2-3 for first-generation couplings. Our results point to deep synergies between precision studies of confinement and the in-depth exploration of the Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Development and performance test of p-type Silicon pad array detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reports on the development and comprehensive evaluation of p-type silicon detector arrays fabricated at the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), Mohali, India. The detectors consist of an 8~$\times$~9 array of 1~$\times$~1~cm$^2$ pads fabricated on 6-inch wafers and read out using the High Granularity Calorimeter Readout Chip (HGCROC). Electrical characterization of the detector through current vs. voltage (IV) and capacitance vs. voltage (CV) measurements demonstrated consistent breakdown and full depletion voltages across all pads, in agreement with Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) device simulations. Laboratory measurements with a $^{90}$Sr source and beam tests at PS, CERN with 10 GeV pions, showed a clear Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) signal, well separated from the pedestal and uniform response of the pads with an average signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio above 5.5. The measured shower profiles with 2-4 GeV positron beams for various thicknesses of a tungsten absorber placed in front of the detector are found to be in agreement with the corresponding Geant4 simulations. The performance test results for the detector show that it is a promising candidate for the future ALICE upgrade detector named Forward Calorimeter (FoCal). The FoCal will have alternating layers of low and high-granularity silicon pad detectors with absorbers as a part of the electromagnetic segment, and along with its hadronic segment, will study the direct photons, neutral hadrons, vector mesons, and jets production in the low Bjorken-x region.</description>

      <title>Realistic shell model for ordinary muon capture of sd-shell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report about a study of the ordinary muon capture in nuclei belonging to the sd shell, an electroweak process that occurs with exchange momenta far larger than ordinary beta decays (approximately 100 MeV). Such a characteristic places this transition in an energy range that is consistent with the neutrinoless double-beta decay, and represents an interesting test for nuclear models to support their predictions of the nuclear matrix elements for such an unobserved process. For the first time, the calculations are carried out within the realistic shell model (RSM), namely employing effective shell-model Hamiltonians and decay operators derived from realistic nuclear forces, without resorting to any empirical adjustment of the coupling constants. This is a chapter of a research program that is aimed to assess the realistic shell model in reproducing the observables related to electroweak processes in nuclei, and then to evaluate the reliability of nuclear matrix elements for the neutrinoless double-beta decay that are calculated within this approach. We calculate the partial capture rates for many nuclear systems in the sd-shell region, as well as their spectroscopic properties, and compare the results with the available experimental counterparts. Such a comparison tests the relevance of a microscopic approach to the renormalization of transition operators to reproduce data and provide solid predictions of unknown observables.</description>

      <title>Vertex reconstruction in the TAO experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a tonne-scale gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). It is designed to measure the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution, better than 2% at 1 MeV. To fully achieve its designed performance, precise vertex reconstruction is crucial. This work reports two distinct vertex reconstruction methods, the charge center algorithm (CCA) and the deep learning algorithm (DLA). We describe the efforts in optimizing and improving these two methods and compare their reconstruction performance. The results show that the CCA and DLA methods can achieve vertex position resolutions better than 20mm (bias&lt;5mm) and 12mm (bias&lt;1.3mm) at 1 MeV, respectively, fully meeting the requirements of the TAO experiment. The reconstruction algorithms developed in this study not only prepare the TAO experiment for its upcoming real data but also hold significant potential for application in other similar experiments.</description>

      <title>Inference of multi-channel r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way using binary neutron star merger observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of GW170817 strongly suggest that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers produce rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis (r-process) elements. However, it remains an open question whether these mergers can account for all the r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way's history. Here, we constrain the contributions of the BNS channel using astrophysical neutron star observations. The rate and mass distributions are constrained by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra through the latest catalog GWTC-3, the neutron star equation of state by gravitational-wave, radio, and X-ray observations, and the delay time distribution by short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy associations. We present a Bayesian framework to consistently combine these lines of observations with abundance data to quantify the contribution and uncertainties of single and multiple astrophysical enrichment sources. Whereas we obtain a distribution of per-event BNS r-process element yields consistent with geophysical and astrophysical abundance constraints, BNS-only enrichment scenarios are inconsistent with the observed r-process abundance trend of disk stars in the Galaxy. Using stellar abundance observations instead of the short GRB constraints, we infer a shorter delay time distribution with power-law index $\alpha\leq -2.0$ and minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}\leq 40$ Myr at 90\% confidence. Such delay times are in tension with those predicted by standard BNS formation models. Alternatively, we confirm that a two-channel scenario, in which the second channel tracks the star formation history without significant delay, can account for both Galactic stellar and short GRB observations. We show that 45--90\% of the r-process abundance in the Milky Way today was produced by a star-formation-tracking channel, rather than BNS mergers with significant delay times.</description>

      <title>Converting sWeights to Probabilities with Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning approaches continues to have many benefits in experimental nuclear and particle physics. One common issue is generating training data which is sufficiently realistic to give reliable results. Here we advocate using real experimental data as the source of training data and demonstrate how one might subtract background contributions through the use of probabilistic weights which can be readily applied to training data. The sPlot formalism is a common tool used to isolate distributions from different sources. However, the negative sWeights produced by the sPlot technique can cause training problems and poor predictive power. This article demonstrates how density ratio estimation can be applied to convert sWeights to event probabilities, which we call drWeights. The drWeights can then be applied to produce the distributions of interest and are consistent with direct use of the sWeights. This article will also show how decision trees are particularly well suited to convert sWeights, with the benefit of fast prediction rates and adaptability to aspects of experimental data such as the data sample size and proportions of different event sources. We also show that a density ratio product approach in which the initial drWeights are reweighted by an additional converter gives substantially better results.</description>

      <title>QED nuclear medium effects at EIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) nuclear medium effects under the experimental conditions of future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) experiments. Our work offers numerical estimates, particularly in the context of inclusive deep inelastic scattering on a $^{208}_{82}\mathrm{Pb}$ nucleus. While prior studies have predominantly focused on elastic scattering, our investigation extends to the more complex scenarios of inelastic processes within a nuclear medium. Our findings suggest that the cross-section corrections due to QED nuclear medium effects could be substantial, reaching or exceeding the level of experimental precision. This work further compares the effects of single re-scattering events with those of multiple re-scatterings, as particles travel the nuclear volume. We estimate the dominant source of the uncertainties associated with our formalism by varying the scale of the atomic physics where the screening of the electric field of the nucleus happens. This calculation not only contributes to the understanding of QED nuclear medium effects, but also offers a path to a more precise extraction of the process-independent non-perturbative structure of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard and Tsallis distributions from transverse momentum spectra in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons, specifically bosons ($\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$) as well as fermions [$p(\bar p)$], produced in small collision systems, namely deuteron-gold (d+Au) and proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the top energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, are investigated in this paper. In present study, d+Au collisions are categorized into three centrality classes: central (0--20\%), semi-central (20--40\%), and peripheral (40--100\%) collisions. Various types of distributions, including standard [Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) and Boltzmann] and Tsallis distributions, are employed to fit the same $p_T$ spectra to derive different effective temperatures denoted as $T_{eff}$. The results indicate that $T_{eff}$ values obtained from Bose-Einstein, Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Tsallis distributions exhibit systematically a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, these $T_{eff}$ values also show a decreasing trend with a decrease in collision centrality. Furthermore, based on the spectra of given particles, a perfect linear relationship is observed between different pairwise combinations of $T_{eff}$ derived from both Boltzmann and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions as well as between Tsallis and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions.</description>
