      <title>Effects of symmetry and hydrodynamics on the cohesion of groups of swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When groups of inertial swimmers move together, hydrodynamic interactions play a key role in shaping their collective dynamics, including the cohesion of the group. To explore how these interactions influence group cohesion, we develop a three-dimensional, inviscid, far-field model of a swimmer. Focusing on symmetric triangular, diamond, and circular group arrangements, we investigate whether passive hydrodynamics alone can promote cohesive behavior, and what role symmetry of the group plays. While small symmetric (and even asymmetric) groups can be cohesive, larger groups typically are not, instead breaking apart into smaller, self-organized subgroups that are cohesive. Notably, we discover circular arrangements of swimmers that chase each other around a circle, resembling the milling behavior of natural fish schools; we call this hydrodynamic milling. Hydrodynamic milling is cohesive in the sense that it is a fixed point of a particular Poincar\'e map, but it is unstable, especially to asymmetric perturbations. Our findings suggest that while passive hydrodynamics alone cannot sustain large-scale cohesion indefinitely, controlling interactions between subgroups, or controlling the behavior of only the periphery of a large group, could potentially enable stable collective behavior with minimal active input.</description>

      <title>Electric field effects on the collision efficiency of uncharged water droplets in a linear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of collisions between a pair of uncharged conducting droplets under the influence of a uniaxial compressional flow and an external electric field. The near-field asymptotic expression for the electric-field-induced attractive force demonstrate that surface-to-surface contact in finite time is facilitated by overcoming lubrication resistance. We demonstrate the significant role of the external electric field on the relative trajectories of two droplets in a compressional flow and provide estimates of the correlation between collision efficiency and the forces induced by the electric field. For droplet collisions in clouds, continuum lubrication approximations become inadequate to capture collision dynamics, and thus we incorporate non-continuum lubrication interactions into our analysis to address this complexity. Our findings reveal the dependence of collision efficiency on the strength of the electric field, geometry of the two interacting droplets, non-continuum effects, and van der Waals forces.</description>

      <title>Impact pressure enhancement upon disk impact on a boiling liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the impact of a flat, horizontal disk onto a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid in thermal equilibrium with its vapor phase. We observe exceptionally high impact pressures deviating strongly from the inertial scaling found for impact in a non-condensable environment, coinciding with the rapid collapse of the vapor pocket entrapped below the disk. We explain our findings, which are relevant for the safe transportation of cryogenic fuels, as a result of vapor condensation, leading to accelerated vapor pocket contraction at high impact velocity and low vapor density.</description>

      <title>Attached Decelerating Turbulent Boundary Layers over Riblets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent boundary layers over riblets subjected to adverse pressure gradients (APGs) are investigated by direct numerical simulation. Multiple APG strengths and riblet sizes are examined, permitting evaluation of drag modification by riblets, and associated physical mechanisms, in various regimes established for zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) riblet flows. The APG strengths are selected such that the flow remains attached. It is found that during APGs, riblets reduce drag beyond what has been achieved in ZPG flows. In extreme cases, an upstream force (i.e., negative drag) is attained. The significant drag reduction is found to be a product of Kelvin-Helmholtz roller vortices forming near the riblet crest, which are augmented in size, strength, and frequency during the APG. The preliminary results reported here indicate the need to modify existing metrics to predict drag reduction and the onset of KH rollers by riblets when the pressure gradient is non-negligible. Further analysis will be documented in the final paper.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal spectral transfers in fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by previous work on kinetic energy cascades in the ocean and atmosphere, we develop a spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool that can be used to study scales of variability in generalized dynamical systems. In particular, we use generalized time-frequency methods from signal analysis to broaden the applicability of frequency transfers from theoretical to practical applications such as the study of ocean or atmosphere data or simulation output. We also show that triad interactions in wavenumber used to study kinetic energy and enstrophy cascades can be generalized to study triad interactions in frequency or wavenumber-frequency. We study the effects of sweeping on the locality of frequency transfers and frequency triad interactions to better understand the locality of spatio-temporal frequency transfers. As an illustrative example, we use the spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool to study the results of a simulation of two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. This simulated fluid is forced at a well-defined wavenumber and frequency with dissipation occurring at both large and small scales, making this one of the first studies of "modulated turbulence" in two dimensions. Our results show that the spatio-temporal transfers we develop in this paper are robust to potential practical problems such as low sampling rates or nonstationarity in time series of interest. We anticipate that this method will be a useful tool in studying scales of spatio-temporal variability in a wide range of fluids applications as higher resolution data and simulations become more widely available.</description>

      <title>Emergent clogging of continuum particle suspensions in constricted channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle suspensions in confined geometries can become clogged, which can have a catastrophic effect on function in biological and industrial systems. Here, we investigate the macroscopic dynamics of suspensions in constricted geometries. We develop a minimal continuum two-phase model that allows for variation in particle volume fraction. The model comprises a ``wet solid'' phase with material properties dependent on the particle volume fraction, and a seepage Darcy flow of fluid through the particles. We find that spatially varying geometry (or material properties) can induce emergent heterogeneity in the particle fraction and trigger the abrupt transition to a high-particle-fraction ``clogged'' state.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian flow statistics in experimental homogeneous isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on Lagrangian flow statistics from experimental measurements of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The investigated flow is driven by 12 impellers inside an icosahedral volume. Seven impeller rotation rates are considered resulting in seven Reynolds numbers with $205 \leq \text{Re}_\lambda \leq 602$. We perform high-speed imaging using 3 cameras to record a total of $8.2\times10^6$ frames, and using high resolution three dimensional (3D) particle tracking velocimetry position, velocity, and acceleration of particle tracks are obtained in the vicinity of the center of the device. From these tracks, we obtain the Eulerian and Lagrangian flow statistics, mainly based on second-order structure functions and autocorrelation functions. The universal constants $C_0^*$ (for the Lagrangian second order structure function), $C_\varepsilon$ (for the energy injection rate) and $a_0$ (for the acceleration fluctuations) are determined, as well as all the relevant Lagrangian and Eulerian flow time scales. Analytical relations between these constants and time scales are experimentally verified.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>

      <title>State-dependent convergence of Galerkin-based reduced-order models for Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the effect of basis functions on the performance and convergence of the Galerkin projection-based reduced-order model (ROM) in the minimal flow unit of Couette flow. POD (proper orthogonal decomposition) modes obtained from direct numerical simulation and controllability and balanced truncation modes from the linearised Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) with different base flows (laminar base flow and turbulent mean flow) and an eddy viscosity model are considered. In the neighbourhood of the laminar base state, the ROMs based on the modes from the LNSE with the laminar base flow and molecular viscosity are found to perform very well as they are able to capture the linear stability of the laminar base flow for each plane Fourier component only with a single degree of freedom. In particular, the ROM based on the balanced truncation modes models the linear dynamics involving transient growth around the laminar base flow most effectively, consistent with previous studies. In contrast, for turbulent state, the ROM based on POD modes is found to reproduce its statistics and coherent dynamics most effectively. The ROMs based on the modes from the LNSE with turbulent mean flow and an eddy viscosity model performs better compared to any other ROMs using the modes from the LNSE. These observations suggest that the performance and convergence of a ROM are highly state-dependent. In particular, this state dependence is strongly correlated with the information and dynamics that each of the basis functions contains. Discussions supporting these observations are also provided in relation to the flow physics involved and the form of coherent structures in Couette flow.</description>

      <title>Scale-by-scale kinetic energy flux calculations in simulations of rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence is an out-of-equilibrium flow state that is characterised by nonzero net fluxes of kinetic energy between different scales of the flow. These fluxes play a crucial role in the formation of characteristic flow structures in many turbulent flows encountered in nature. However, measuring these energy fluxes in practical settings can be challenging as soon as one moves away from unrestricted turbulence in an idealised periodic box. Here, we focus on rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, being the canonical model system to study geophysical and astrophysical flows. Owing to the effect of rotation, this flow can yield a split cascade, where part of the energy is transported to smaller scales (direct cascade), while another fraction is transported to larger scales (inverse cascade). We compare two different techniques for measuring these energy fluxes throughout the domain: one based on a spatial filtering approach and an adapted Fourier-based method. We show how one can use these methods to measure the energy flux adequately in the anisotropic, aperiodic domains encountered in rotating convection, even in domains with spatial confinement. Our measurements reveal that in the studied regime, the bulk flow is dominated by the direct cascade, while significant inverse cascading action is observed most strongly near the top and bottom plates, due to the vortex merging of Ekman plumes into larger flow structures.</description>

      <title>Rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection: Attractors, bifurcations and heat transport via a Galerkin hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for energetically consistent climate models, the Boussinessq-Coriolis (BC) equations are studied with a focus on the averaged vertical heat transport, ie the Nusselt number. A set of formulae are derived by which arbitrary Fourier truncations of the BC model can be explicitly generated, and Criteria are given which precisely guarantee that such truncated models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE. The Howard-Krishnamurti-Coriolis (HKC) hierarchy of such energetically consistent ODE models is then implemented in MATLAB, with code available on GitHub. Several theoretical results are proven to support a numerical analysis. Well-posedness and convergence of the HKC hierarchy toward the BC model are proven, as well as the existence of an attractor for the BC model. Since the rate of convergence is unknown, explicit upper and lower bounds on the attractor dimension are proven so as to provide guidance for the required spatial resolution for an accurate approximation of the Nusselt number. Finally, a series of numerical studies are performed using MATLAB, which investigate the required spatial resolution and indicate the presence of multiple stable values of the Nusselt number, setting the stage for an energetically consistent analysis of convective heat transport.</description>
