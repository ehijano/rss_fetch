      <title>Rethinking Text-to-SQL: Dynamic Multi-turn SQL Interaction for Real-world Database Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static, single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation. Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database. The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change. DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling 1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty.

      <title>Direct Access for Conjunctive Queries with Negations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a conjunctive query $Q$ and a database $D$, a direct access to the answers of $Q$ over $D$ is the operation of returning, given an index $k$, the $k$-th answer for some order on its answers. While this problem is #P-hard in general with respect to combined complexity, many conjunctive queries have an underlying structure that allows for a direct access to their answers for some lexicographical ordering that takes polylogarithmic time in the size of the database after a polynomial time precomputation. Previous work has precisely characterised the tractable classes and given fine-grained lower bounds on the precomputation time needed depending on the structure of the query.
  In this paper, we generalise these tractability results to the case of signed conjunctive queries, that is, conjunctive queries that may contain negative atoms. Our technique is based on a class of circuits that can represent relational data. We first show that this class supports tractable direct access after a polynomial time preprocessing. We then give bounds on the size of the circuit needed to represent the answer set of signed conjunctive queries depending on their structure. Both results combined together allow us to prove the tractability of direct access for a large class of conjunctive queries. On the one hand, we recover the known tractable classes from the literature in the case of positive conjunctive queries. On the other hand, we generalise and unify known tractability results about negative conjunctive queries -- that is, queries having only negated atoms. In particular, we show that the class of $\beta$-acyclic negative conjunctive queries and the class of bounded nest set width negative conjunctive queries admit tractable direct access.</description>

      <title>ProGQL: A Provenance Graph Query System for Cyber Attack Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Provenance analysis (PA) has recently emerged as an important solution for cyber attack investigation. PA leverages system monitoring to monitor system activities as a series of system audit events and organizes these events as a provenance graph to show the dependencies among system activities, which can reveal steps of cyber attacks. Despite their potential, existing PA techniques face two critical challenges: (1) they are inflexible and non-extensible, making it difficult to incorporate analyst expertise, and (2) they are memory inefficient, often requiring&gt;100GB of RAM to hold entire event streams, which fundamentally limits scalability and deployment in real-world environments. To address these limitations, we propose the ProGQL framework, which provides a domain-specific graph search language with a well-engineered query engine, allowing PA over system audit events and expert knowledge to be jointly expressed as a graph search query and thereby facilitating the investigation of complex cyberattacks. In particular, to support dependency searches from a starting edge required in PA, ProGQL introduces new language constructs for constrained graph traversal, edge weight computation, value propagation along weighted edges, and graph merging to integrate multiple searches. Moreover, the ProGQL query engine is optimized for efficient incremental graph search across heterogeneous database backends, eliminating the need for full in-memory materialization and reducing memory overhead. Our evaluations on real attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of the ProGQL language in expressing a diverse set of complex attacks compared with the state-of-the-art graph query language Cypher, and the comparison with the SOTA PA technique DEPIMPACT further demonstrates the significant improvement of the scalability brought by our ProGQL framework's design.</description>
