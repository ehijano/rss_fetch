      <title>Characterization of micro-SPECT system based on Timepix detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the characteristics of a prototype SPECT system based on the Timepix readout chip, with a MURA type encoding mask, were evaluated. The set-up has a small field of view and can be used in preclinical studies of drugs in small laboratory animals. Despite many existing test protocols developed and described in pertinent documents of national standard bodies and IAEA recommendation, they are not suitable for microtomographic systems based on semiconductor pixel detectors due to different detector technology, high spatial resolution and small area of interest. To measure their characteristics, special phantoms were developed, with a small "hot~region". Such micro-SPECT parameters as spatial resolution, contrast, linearity and system efficiency were studied using Tc-99m source. The detector calibration and data preprocessing are described.</description>

      <title>Pre-study of a Li2MoO4 based bolometer for 100Mo neutrinoless double beta decay experiment in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cryogenic phonon scintillating bolometer is a promising and extremely attractive option to search for the nuclide neutrinoless double beta decay. In this paper, a pre-study of bolometer based on Li2MoO4 (LMO) crystal is presented, in which the properties of the LMO crystal at the low temperature, including scintillation characteristics and specific heat, are investigated in detail. The excitation spectrum and light yield are measured from the room temperature down to 10 K, and heat capacity is measured down to temperature of O(200) mK. Furthermore, a (2 cm)3 cubic LMO based bolometer is manufactured and tested at ultra-low mK-level temperature in a ground-above cryostat platform, and a good energy resolution is achieved. The studies laid a foundation to manufacture the bolometer detector in China and conduct neutrinoless double beta decay research at the China Jinping Underground Laborator</description>

      <title>Improving Positron Lifetime Spectra Quality by Suppressing Corrupted Coincidences via Pulse-Height Spectrum Window Adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) is a powerful technique for detecting microstructural defects in various material classes. In a commonly used 180{\deg} detector configuration equipped with plastic scintillators, measurement accuracy is mainly affected by simultaneous detection of 1275 keV and 511 keV gamma quanta in the same detector. This study introduces an optimization approach that significantly improves spectra quality without requiring hardware modifications. By systematically adjusting the upper threshold of the start window in the Pulse Height Spectrum (PHS), this method effectively reduces unwanted 1275/511 piled-up events. Experimental validation with high purity aluminium samples demonstrates that lowering this threshold effectively suppresses corrupted coincidences, yielding extracted characteristic lifetimes closer to those from a 90{\deg} configuration. While a reduced upper threshold slightly broadens the instrument response function (IRF) due to an effectively reduced number of scintillation photons, the overall impact on timing resolution remains negligible. This approach enhances the reliability of PALS measurements while still preserving the benefits of a 180{\deg} configuration, i.e. high solid-angle efficiency.</description>

      <title>Timing performance of a digital SiPM prototype measured with a picosecond injection laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DESY digital silicon photomultiplier (dSiPM) is a monolithic detector based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) and features a fully digital readout. The dSiPM prototype was characterized using a picosecond injection laser. Different contributions to the time resolution from both SPADs and digitization electronics are quantified. The dSiPM achieves a temporal resolution of approximately 50 ps under optimal conditions, while localized charge deposition with the laser revealed in-pixel variations of the time resolution linked to the SPAD layout. Combining fast timing with a pixelated readout, the device is a promising candidate for 4D-tracking detectors and other precision timing applications.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Crystalline Defects in 4H Silicon Carbide using DLTS and TSC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future hadron collider experiments will require sensing materials that withstand stronger radiation fields. Therefore, either a frequent replacement of detectors, a significant increase in radiation hardness of Silicon, or a shift to different materials is needed. Wide-bandgap materials are a natural choice, due to their significantly reduced leakage currents, even after irradiation. In recent years, substantial progress in the production of high-quality monocrystalline Silicon Carbide of the 4H polytype has led to a renewed interest in this material. In this article, a study of electrically active defects in a n-type epitaxial 4H Silicon Carbide diode is presented. By employing spectroscopical measurement methods, like Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) and Thermally Stimulated Currents (TSC), energy levels in the bandgap are investigated. Defect parameters like concentration, activation energy and capture cross-section are stated. A simulation framework was utilised to compare and match the results from the two methods. This study is made in the context of a study of radiation hardness of 4H Silicon Carbide sensors. Other studies investigating macroscopic properties of the material, like their charge collection efficiency after irradiation, were performed on the same kind of diodes. This study provides a first set of measured defect parameters in state-of-the-art 4H-SiC material, from defects present prior to irradiation. These defects are intrinsic, such as vacancies, related to impurities and doping imperfections, or are growth related. The $Z_\text{1/2}$ defect and a Nitrogen related defect were identified.</description>

      <title>The NA60+ experiment at SPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new apparatus, NA60+, is proposed for measuring muon pairs in the center-of-mass region from 5 to 17 GeV at CERN SPS in various collisional systems from Pb+Pb and down to $p$+Be. The physics scope of the new detector will cover topics from the measurement of thermal radiation coming from the hot and dense medium to chiral symmetry restoration, strangeness, and charm production.
  The proposed detector consists of a vertex spectrometer based on novel technology, allowing the production of large silicon sensors and a large-acceptance muon spectrometer based on gaseous detectors. With its high beam intensity, the new apparatus provides access to rare observables that have been scarcely studied until now. The new detector will come into operation after the Long Shutdown 3 of the LHC (past 2029) and is aimed at the first data-taking with Pb and proton beams. In this contribution, we review the project and recent R\&amp;D effort, including the technical aspects and the studies of the physics performances for the observables.</description>

      <title>A ROOT based detector geometry and event visualization system for JUNO-TAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO or JUNO-TAO) is a satellite experiment of Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) and located near the Taishan nuclear power plant (NPP). TAO will measure the energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos with unprecedented precision, which will benefit both reactor neutrino physics and the nuclear database. A detector geometry and event visualization system has been developed for TAO. The software is based on ROOT packages and embedded in the TAO offline software framework. It provides an intuitive tool to visualize the detector geometry, tune the reconstruction algorithm, understand the neutrino physics, and monitor the operation of reactors at NPP. The further applications of the visualization system in the experimental operation of TAO and its future development are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the large-size NDL EQR20 silicon photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike most commercially available silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), EQR20 SiPMs produced by the Novel Device Laboratory (NDL) avoid using individual resistors to quench the avalanche multiplication of the microcells. Instead, bulk resistance of the epitaxial silicon layer is used, and the signal is directly collected at a common anode plane. This allows for the fabrication of SiPMs as large as 6.24 x 6.24 mm^2 while keeping the recovery time below {\tau} = 25 ns. These devices can be composed of microcells with 20 micrometer pitch while reaching PDE above 50% and 10^6 gain at 5 V overvoltage. On the other hand, a crosstalk level from 20% to 40% is observed for overvoltages from 3 V to 5 V. Moreover, significant pulse shape distortion is observed for pulses above ~100 pC, corresponding to microcell occupancy of a few percent. This work provides an independent determination of the performance parameters of the EQR20 11-6060D-S SiPMs. Influence of the pulse shape distortion is discussed from the perspective of the applicability of these devices to the scintillator-based forward hadron calorimeter (FoCal-H) of the ALICE apparatus at CERN.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Design and Performance Simulation of a Thermal Neutron Diffractometer Using McStas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a preliminary design and simulation of a thermal neutron diffractometer using the McStas Monte Carlo ray-tracing package. The simulated system is based on generalized instrument parameters, including typical collimator divergences, monochromator mosaic spreads, and detector positioning, rather than on any specific engineering blueprint. The simulation evaluates key performance metrics such as neutron flux distribution, beam divergence, and wavelength resolution along the beam path.
  Results demonstrate that, even under simplified geometric assumptions, the model can provide insight into component alignment, resolution limitations, and flux attenuation behavior. The modular structure of the simulation allows easy parameter adjustments for different instrument configurations and serves as a foundation for more advanced system-specific optimization studies.
  Additionally, the provided McStas input file serves as a reusable and customizable simulation template that can significantly reduce modeling time for engineering personnel during the early-stage design and layout phase. This tool also facilitates technical training and comparative analysis without relying on finalized engineering drawings.</description>

      <title>The Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit for Neutrino and Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) are widely deployed at neutrino and dark matter experiments for photon counting. When multiple photons hit a PMT consecutively, their photo-electron (PE) pulses pile up to hinder the precise measurements of the count and timings. We introduce Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit (FSMP) to analyze the PMT signal waveforms into individual PEs with the strategy of reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments, gains acceleration on GPUs and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs with jumbo-charge outputs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 10% from the long-serving method of waveform integration.</description>

      <title>AI-based particle track identification in scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of an AI-based method for particle track identification using scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) to efficiently filter and identify frames containing signal from the substantial data generated by SPAD array sensors. Our VAE model, trained on purely background frames, demonstrated a high capability to distinguish frames containing particle tracks from background noise. The performance of the VAE-based anomaly detection was validated with experimental data, demonstrating the method's ability to efficiently identify relevant events with rapid processing time, suggesting a solid prospect for deployment as a fast inference tool on hardware for real-time anomaly detection. This work highlights the potential of combining advanced sensor technology with machine learning techniques to enhance particle detection and tracking.</description>

      <title>Performance and radiation damage mitigation strategy for silicon photomultipliers on LEO space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space missions require lightweight, low-power consuming, radiation-tolerant components. Silicon photomultipliers are increasingly used for detecting near-UV, optical, and infrared light in space due to their compact design, low cost, low power consumption, robustness, and high photo-detection efficiency, which makes them sensitive to single photons. Although SiPMs outperform traditional photomultiplier tubes in many areas, concerns about their radiation tolerance and noise remain. In this study, we estimate the radiation effects on a satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550~km during the declining phase of solar cycle 25 (2026-2029). We evaluated silicon photomultipliers produced by the Foundation Bruno Kessler (FBK) using front-side illuminated technology with metal trenches (NUV-HD-MT), assessing their response to a 50~MeV proton beam and exposure to a $\beta$-radioactive source (strontium-90). Simulations with SPENVIS and Geant4 were used to validate the experimental results. Based on our findings, we propose a photosensor annealing strategy for space-based instruments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primary cosmic rays when interact with our atmosphere, produce a cascade of lighter secondary particles namely pion, kaon, neutrons, muons, electrons, positrons and neutrinos. Muons are one of the most abundant and easily detectable particles at the ground surface using a large variety of particle detectors. Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) of 2m x 2m in dimension were developed to be used in large scale as the active detector elements in the Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) which was planned to be built by the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). As a spin-off of this work, a portable stack of eight, one square foot RPC detectors is developed named as Cosmic Muon Tracker (CMT). It could be used to conduct small-scale particle detector experiments as well as training Students. We will discuss design, integration, characterisation and some of the applications of this detector in this paper.</description>
