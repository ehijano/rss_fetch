      <title>Voting with Partial Orders: The Plurality and Anti-Plurality Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Plurality rule for linear orders selects the alternatives most frequently appearing in the first position of those orders, while the Anti-Plurality rule selects the alternatives least often occurring in the final position. We explore extensions of these rules to partial orders, offering axiomatic characterizations for these extensions.</description>

      <title>Nash implementation in a many-to-one matching market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a many-to-one matching market, we analyze the matching game induced by a stable rule when firms' choice function satisfy substitutability. We show that any stable rule implements the individually rational correspondence in Nash equilibrium when both sides of the market play strategically. Moreover, when only workers play strategically and firms' choice functions satisfy the law of aggregate demand, we show that the firm-optimal stable rule implements the stable correspondence in Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Competitive advantage of URLLC vs. eMBB for supporting timeliness-relevant services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 5G specifications promise a common and flexible-enough network infrastructure capable of satisfying diverse requirements of both current and future use cases. Two service types standardized in 5G are eMBB, without stringent delay guarantee, and URLLC, with stringent delay guarantee. We focus on a use case where data timeliness is the relevant quality parameter. We provide an economic rationale for the support of data-based services, that is, from the point of view of the profits attained by the service providers and operators (SP). More specifically, we focus on data-based services the quality of which is related to the Age of Information, and we assess two alternatives for the support of this sort of services by means of a 5G network: one that is based on the eMBB service type, and one that is based on the URLLC service type. These assessment is conducted in a duopoly scenario. We conclude that URLLC support provides a competitive advantage to an SP against a competitor SP that supports its service offering on eMBB. And that there is a slightly better situation for the users when the URLLC QoS constraint is stringent.</description>
