      <title>Numerical investigation of three-dimensional effects of cavitating flow in a venturi-type hydrodynamic cavitation reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Hydrodynamic Cavitation (HC) has emerged as a promising method for wastewater treatment, bio-diesel production and multiple other environmental processes with Venturi-type cavitation reactors showing particular advantages. However, numerical simulations of a venturi-type reactor with an elucidated explanation of the underlying flow physics remain inadequate. The present study numerically investigates and analyzes the flow inside a venturi-type reactor from both global cavity dynamics and localized turbulence statistics perspectives. Some models in the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) family are employed to model the turbulence with the study initially comparing 2D simulations before extending the analysis to 3D simulations. The results show that while URANS models show significantly different dynamics as a result of grid refinement, the DES models show standard flow dynamics associated with cavitating flows. Nevertheless, signifi- cant discrepancies continue to exist when comparing the turbulence statistics on the local scale. As the discussion extends to 3D calculations, the DES models are able to well predict the turbulence phenomena at the local scale and reveal some new insights regarding the role of baroclinic torque into the cavitation-vortex interaction.The findings of this study thus contribute to the fundamental understandings of the venturi-type reactor.</description>

      <title>Quantifying small-scale anisotropy in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The verification of whether small-scale turbulence is isotropic remains a grand challenge. The difficulty arises because the presence of small-scale anisotropy is tied to the dissipation tensor, whose components require the full three-dimensional information of the flow field in both high spatial and temporal resolution, a condition rarely satisfied in turbulence experiments, especially during field scale measurement of atmospheric turbulence. To circumvent this issue, an \emph{intermittency-anisotropy} framework is proposed through which we successfully extract the features of small-scale anisotropy from single-point measurements of turbulent time series by exploiting the properties of small-scale intermittency. Specifically, this framework quantifies anisotropy by studying the contrasting effects of burst-like activities on the scale-wise production of turbulence kinetic energy between the horizontal and vertical directions. The veracity of this approach is tested by applying it over a range of datasets covering an unprecedented range in the Reynolds numbers ($Re \approx 10^{3}$ to $10^{6}$), sampling frequencies (10 kHz to 10 Hz), surface conditions (aerodynamically smooth surfaces to typical grasslands to forest canopies), and flow types (channel flows, boundary layer flows, atmospheric flows, and flows over forest canopies). For these diverse datasets, the findings indicate that the effects of small-scale anisotropy persists up to the integral scales of the streamwise velocity fluctuations and there exists a universal relationship to predict this anisotropy from the two-component state of the Reynolds stress tensor. This relationship is important towards the development of next-generation closure models of wall-turbulence by incorporating the effects of anisotropy at smaller scales of the flow.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of the aerodynamic deformation and drag for a freely moving drop in the sub-critical Weber number regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the dynamics and deformation of freely moving drops is crucial for numerous droplet applications. When the Weber number is finite but below a critical value, the drop deviates from its spherical shape and deforms as it is accelerated by the gas stream. Since aerodynamic drag on the drop depends on its shape oscillation, accurately modeling the drop shape evolution is essential for predicting the drop's velocity and position. In this study, 2D axisymmetric interface-resolved simulations were performed to provide a comprehensive dataset for developing a data-driven model. Parametric simulations were conducted by systematically varying the drop diameter and free-stream velocity, achieving wide ranges of Weber and Reynolds numbers. The instantaneous drop shapes obtained in simulations are characterized by spherical harmonics. Temporal data of the drag and modal coefficients are collected from the simulation data to train a Nonlinear Auto-Regressive models with eXogenous inputs (NARX) neural network model. The overall model consists of two multi-layer perceptron networks, which predict the modal coefficients and the drop drag, respectively. The drop shape can be reconstructed with the predicted modal coefficients. The model predictions are validated against the simulation data in the testing set, showing excellent agreement for the evolutions of both the drop shape and drag.</description>

      <title>Explosively driven Richtmyer--Meshkov instability jet suppression and enhancement via coupling machine learning and additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control the behavior of fluid instabilities at material interfaces, such as the shock-driven Richtmyer--Meshkov instability, is a grand technological challenge with a broad number of applications ranging from inertial confinement fusion experiments to explosively driven shaped charges. In this work, we use a linear-geometry shaped charge as a means of studying methods for controlling material jetting that results from the Richtmyer--Meshkov instability. A shaped charge produces a high-velocity jet by focusing the energy from the detonation of high explosives. The interaction of the resulting detonation wave with a hollowed cavity lined with a thin metal layer produces the unstable jetting effect. By modifying characteristics of the detonation wave prior to striking the lined cavity, the kinetic energy of the jet can be enhanced or reduced. Modifying the geometry of the liner material can also be used to alter jetting properties. We apply optimization methods to investigate several design parameterizations for both enhancing or suppressing the shaped-charge jet. This is accomplished using 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the design space that we consider. We also apply new additive manufacturing methods for producing the shaped-charge assemblies, which allow for experimental testing of complicated design geometries obtained through computational optimization. We present a direct comparison of our optimized designs with experimental results carried out at the High Explosives Application Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</description>

      <title>General synthetic iterative scheme for rarefied gas mixture flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical simulation of rarefied gas mixtures with disparate mass and concentration is a huge research challenge. Based on our recent kinetic modelling for monatomic gas mixture flows, this problem is tackled by the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), where the mesoscopic kinetic and macroscopic synthetic equations are alternately solved by the finite-volume discrete velocity method. Three important features of GSIS are highlighted. First, the synthetic equations are precisely derived from the kinetic equation, naturally reducing to the Navier-Stokes equations in the continuum flow regime; in other flow regimes, the kinetic equation provides high-order closure of the constitutive relations to capture the rarefaction effects. Second, these synthetic equations, which can be solved quickly, help to adjust the kinetic system to relax rapidly toward the steady state. Furthermore, in such a two-way coupling, the constraint on the spatial cell size is relieved. Third, the linear Fourier stability analysis demonstrates that the error decay rate in GSIS is smaller than 0.5 for various combinations of mass, concentration and viscosity ratios, such that the error can be reduced by three orders of magnitude after 10 iterations. The efficiency and accuracy of GSIS are demonstrated through several challenging cases covering a wide range of mass ratio, species concentration, and flow speed.</description>

      <title>A Formulation of Quantum Fluid Mechanics and Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formalism of classical mechanics is given for time-dependent many-body states of quantum mechanics, describing both fluid flow and point mass trajectories. The familiar equations of energy, motion, and those of Lagrangian mechanics are obtained. An energy and continuity equation is demonstrated to be equivalent to the real and imaginary parts of the time dependent Schroedinger equation, respectively, where the Schroedinger equation is in density matrix form. For certain stationary states, using Lagrangian mechanics and a Hamiltonian function for quantum mechanics, equations for point-mass trajectories are obtained. For 1-body states and fluid flows, the energy equation and equations of motion are the Bernoulli and Euler equations of fluid mechanics, respectively. Generalizations of the energy and Euler equations are derived to obtain equations that are in the same form as they are in classical mechanics. The fluid flow type is compressible, inviscid, irrotational, with the nonclassical element of local variable mass. Over all space mass is conserved. The variable mass is a necessary condition for the fluid flow to agree with the zero orbital angular momentum for s states of hydrogen. Cross flows are examined, where velocity directions are changed without changing the kinetic energy. For one-electron atoms, the velocity modification gives closed orbits for trajectories, and mass conservation, vortexes, and density stratification for fluid flows. For many body states, Under certain conditions, and by hypotheses, Euler equations of orbital-flows are obtained. One-body Schroedinger equations that are a generalization of the Hartree-Fock equations are also obtained. These equations contain a quantum Coulomb's law, involving the 2-body pair function of reduced density matrix theory that replace the charge densities.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Parametrised Reduced Order Models for the Study of Hysteresis of the Coanda Effect in Finite Element-based Incompressible Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a general reduced order model (ROM) framework for addressing fluid dynamics problems involving time-dependent geometric parametrisations. The framework integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Empirical Cubature Method (ECM) hyper-reduction techniques to effectively approximate incompressible computational fluid dynamics simulations. To demonstrate the applicability of this framework, we investigate the behavior of a planar contraction-expansion channel geometry exhibiting bifurcating solutions known as the Coanda effect. By introducing time-dependent deformations to the channel geometry, we observe hysteresis phenomena in the solution.
  The paper provides a detailed formulation of the framework, including the stabilised finite elements full order model (FOM) and ROM, with a particular focus on the considerations related to geometric parametrisation. Subsequently, we present the results obtained from the simulations, analysing the solution behavior in a phase-space for the fluid velocity at a probe point, considered as the Quantity of Interest (QoI). Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the ROMs and hyper-reduced order models (HROMs), we demonstrate their ability to accurately reproduce the complete solution field and the QoI.
  While HROMs offer significant computational speedup, enabling efficient simulations, they do exhibit some errors, particularly for testing trajectories. However, their value lies in applications where the detection of the Coanda effect holds paramount importance, even if the selected bifurcation branch is incorrect. Alternatively, for more precise results, HROMs with lower speedups can be employed.</description>

      <title>Coupling the thermal acoustic modes of a bubble to an optomechanical sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report experimental observations of the volume acoustic modes of air bubbles in water, including both the fundamental Minnaert breathing mode and a family of higher-order modes extending into the megahertz frequency range. Bubbles were placed on or near optomechanical sensors having a noise floor substantially determined by ambient medium fluctuations, and which are thus able to detect thermal motions of proximate objects. Bubble motions could be coupled to the sensor through both air (i.e., with the sensor inside the bubble) and water, verifying that sound is radiated by the high-order modes. We also present evidence for elastic-Purcell-effect modifications of the sensor's vibrational spectrum when encapsulated by a bubble, in the form of cavity-modified linewidths and line shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of a two-dimensional wind-driven ocean model with no-slip boundaries reveals the existence of a turbulent asymptotic regime where energy dissipation becomes independent of fluid viscosity. This asymptotic flow represents an out-of-equilibrium state, characterized by a vigorous two-dimensional vortex gas superimposed onto a western-intensified gyre. The properties of the vortex gas are elucidated through scaling analysis for detached Prandtl boundary layers, providing a rationalization for the observed anomalous dissipation. The asymptotic regime demonstrates that boundary instabilities alone can be strong enough to evacuate wind-injected energy from the large-scale oceanic circulation.</description>

      <title>Assessment of models for nonlinear oscillatory flow through a hexagonal sphere pack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review models for unsteady porous media flow in the volume-averaging framework and we discuss the theoretical relations between the models and the definition of the model coefficients (and the uncertainty therein). The different models are compared against direct numerical simulations of oscillatory flow through a hexagonal sphere pack. The model constants are determined based on their definition in terms of the Stokes flow, the potential flow and steady nonlinear flow. Thus, the discrepancies between the model predictions and the simulation data can be attributed to shortcomings of the models' parametrisation.
  We found that an extension of the dynamic permeability model of Pride et al. [Physical Review B 47(9), 1993] with a Forchheimer-type nonlinearity performs very well for linear flow and for nonlinear flow at low and medium frequencies, but the Forchheimer term with a coefficient obtained from the steady-state overpredicts the nonlinear drag at high frequencies. The model reduces to the unsteady Forchheimer equation with an acceleration coefficient based on the static viscous tortuosity for low frequencies.
  The unsteady Forchheimer equation with an acceleration coefficient based on the high frequency limit of the dynamic tortuosity has large errors for linear flow at medium and high frequencies, but low errors for nonlinear flow at all frequencies. This is explained by an error cancellation between the inertial and the nonlinear drag.</description>
