      <title>M2L Translation Operators for Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Methods on Modern Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and future trends in computer hardware, in which the disparity between available flops and memory bandwidth continues to grow, favour algorithm implementations which minimise data movement even at the cost of more flops. In this study we review the requirements for high performance implementations of the kernel independent Fast Multipole Method (kiFMM), a variant of the crucial FMM algorithm for the rapid evaluation of N-body potential problems. Performant implementations of the kiFMM typically rely on Fast Fourier Transforms for the crucial M2L (Multipole-to-Local) operation. However, in recent years for other FMM variants such as the black-box FMM also BLAS based M2L translation operators have become popular that rely on direct matrix compression techniques. In this paper we present algorithmic improvements for BLAS based M2L translation operator and benchmark them against FFT based M2L translation operators. In order to allow a fair comparison we have implemented our own high-performance kiFMM algorithm in Rust that performs competitively against other implementations, and allows us to flexibly switch between BLAS and FFT based translation operators.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Network of Cardiovascular Diseases and Depression via Multipartite Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a significant comorbidity between cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and depression that is highly predictive of poor clinical outcome. Yet, its underlying biological pathways remain challenging to decipher, presumably due to its non-linear associations across multiple mechanisms. Mutual information provides a framework to analyze such intricacies. In this study, we proposed a multipartite projection method based on mutual information correlations to construct multilayer disease networks. We applied the method to a cross-sectional dataset from a wave of the Young Finns Study. This dataset assesses CVD and depression, along with related risk factors and two omics of biomarkers: metabolites and lipids. Instead of directly correlating CVD-related phenotypes and depressive symptoms, we extended the notion of bipartite networks to create a multipartite network that connects these phenotype and symptom variables to intermediate biological variables. Projecting from these intermediate variables results in a weighted multilayer network, where each link between CVD and depression variables is marked by its `layer' (i.e., metabolome or lipidome). Using this projection method, we identified potential mediating biomarkers that connect CVD to depression. These biomarkers thus may play significant roles in the biological pathways of CVD-depression comorbidity. Additionally, the projected network highlights sex and BMI as the most important risk factors, or confounders, associated with the comorbidity. Our method can generalize to any number of omics layers and disease phenotypes, offering a truly system-level overview of biological pathways contributing to comorbidity.</description>

      <title>Trolley Optimisation for Loading Printed Circuit Board Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A trolley is a container for loading printed circuit board (PCB) components, and a trolley optimisation problem (TOP) is an assignment of PCB components to trolleys for use in the production of a set of PCBs in an assembly line. In this paper, we introduce the TOP, a novel operation research application. To formulate the TOP, we derive a novel extension of the bin packing problem. We exploit the problem structure to decompose the TOP into two smaller, identical, and independent problems. Further, we develop a mixed integer linear programming model to solve the TOP and prove that the TOP is an NP-complete problem. A case study of an aerospace manufacturing company is used to illustrate the TOP which successfully automated the manual process in the company and resulted in significant cost reductions and flexibility in the building process.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral based particle initialization algorithm for Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms for initializing particle distribution in SPH simulations are essential for enhancing simulation accuracy. However, no such algorithms exist for boundary integral SPH models, which can model complex geometries without requiring layers of virtual particles. This study introduces the Boundary Integral based Particle Initialization (BIPI) algorithm. It employs a particle shifting technique meticulously designed to redistribute particles to fit the geometry boundary. The BIPI algorithm directly utilizes the geometry's boundary information using the SPH boundary integral formulation. Special consideration is given to particles adjacent to the boundary to prevent artificial volume compression. Consequently, it can automatically generate a "uniform" particle distribution with reduced and stabilized concentration gradients for domains with complex geometrical shapes. Finally, several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, including the application of the BIPI algorithm in flow problems.</description>

      <title>Limit Order Book Dynamics and Order Size Modelling Using Compound Hawkes Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08927v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawkes Process has been used to model Limit Order Book (LOB) dynamics in several ways in the literature however the focus has been limited to capturing the inter-event times while the order size is usually assumed to be constant. We propose a novel methodology of using Compound Hawkes Process for the LOB where each event has an order size sampled from a calibrated distribution. The process is formulated in a novel way such that the spread of the process always remains positive. Further, we condition the model parameters on time of day to support empirical observations. We make use of an enhanced non-parametric method to calibrate the Hawkes kernels and allow for inhibitory cross-excitation kernels. We showcase the results and quality of fits for an equity stock's LOB in the NASDAQ exchange and compare them against several baselines. Finally, we conduct a market impact study of the simulator and show the empirical observation of a concave market impact function is indeed replicated.</description>

      <title>Automatic Feature Recognition and Dimensional Attributes Extraction From CAD Models for Hybrid Additive-Subtractive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP), and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) plays a crucial role in modern manufacturing, facilitating seamless transitions from digital designs to physical products. However, a significant challenge within this integration is the Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) of CAD models, especially in the context of hybrid manufacturing that combines subtractive and additive manufacturing processes. Traditional AFR methods, focused mainly on the identification of subtractive (machined) features including holes, fillets, chamfers, pockets, and slots, fail to recognize features pertinent to additive manufacturing. Furthermore, the traditional methods fall short in accurately extracting geometric dimensions and orientations, which are also key factors for effective manufacturing process planning. This paper presents a novel approach for creating a synthetic CAD dataset that encompasses features relevant to both additive and subtractive machining through Python Open Cascade. The Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCNN) model is implemented to accurately identify the composite additive-subtractive features within the synthetic CAD dataset. The key novelty and contribution of the proposed methodology lie in its ability to recognize a wide range of manufacturing features, and precisely extracting their dimensions, orientations, and stock sizes. The proposed model demonstrates remarkable feature recognition accuracy exceeding 97% and a dimension extraction accuracy of 100% for identified features. Therefore, the proposed methodology enhances the integration of CAD, CAPP, and CAM within hybrid manufacturing by providing precise feature recognition and dimension extraction. It facilitates improved manufacturing process planning, by enabling more informed decision-making.</description>
