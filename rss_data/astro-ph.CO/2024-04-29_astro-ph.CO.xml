      <title>Separating Dark Acoustic Oscillations from Astrophysics at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation redshift and abundance of the first stars and galaxies is highly sensitive to the build up of low mass dark matter halos as well as astrophysical feedback effects which modulate star formation in these low mass halos. The 21-cm signal at cosmic dawn will depend strongly on the formation of these first luminous sources and thus can be used to constrain unknown astrophysical and dark matter properties in the early universe. In this paper, we explore how well we could measure properties of dark matter using the 21-cm power spectrum at $z&gt;10$, given unconstrained astrophysical parameters. We create a generalizable form of the dark matter halo mass function for models with damped and/or oscillatory linear power spectra, finding a single "smooth-k" window function which describes a broad range of models including CDM. We use this to make forecasts for structure formation using the Effective Theory of Structure Formation (ETHOS) framework to explore a broad parameter space of dark matter models. We make predictions for the 21-cm power spectrum observed by HERA varying both cosmological ETHOS parameters as well as astrophysical parameters. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo forecast we find that the ETHOS dark matter parameters are degenerate with astrophysical parameters linked to star formation in low mass dark matter halos but not with X-ray heating produced by the first generation of stars. After marginalizing over uncertainties in astrophysical parameters we demonstrate that with just 540 days of HERA observations it should be possible to distinguish between CDM and a broad range of dark matter models with suppression at wavenumbers $k\lesssim 200\,h$Mpc$^{-1}$ assuming a moderate noise level. These results demonstrate the potential of 21-cm observations to constrain the matter power spectrum on scales smaller than current probes.</description>

      <title>Ricci Reheating on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a non-minimally coupled (NMC) scalar spectator field in non-oscillatory inflationary scenarios, where there is a transition from inflation to kination domination (KD). Engineering a realistic finite-duration transition through a CMB-compatible inflaton potential, we calculate the initial tachyonic growth of the NMC field during KD and perform lattice simulations of the subsequent non-linear dynamics. We characterize the regularization effect on the tachyonic growth, either due to self-interactions, or via gravitational backreaction when the NMC field grows to dominate the energy of the universe. Our study provides the first realistic treatment of the dynamics, with significant improvements compared to previous work, where one or more of the following aspects were assumed: ($i$) the background expansion can be neglected during the tachyonic growth, ($ii$) coherence of the NMC field, ($iii$) coherence of the inflaton, ($iv$) instantaneous transition, and ($v$) a KD equation of state of exactly $w = 1$. Using our methodology, which requires none of the above assumptions, we determine the conditions to achieve proper reheating, i.e. energetic dominance of the NMC field over the inflaton. We characterize the time and energy scales of the problem, either for backreaction due to self-interactions, or (as a novelty of this work) due to gravitational effects. Finally, we calculate $\mathcal{O}(1)$ lattice correction factors to analytic scaling relations derived by some of us in previous work. This enables simple future studies without the need to run lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Luminous giants populate the dense Cosmic Web: The radio luminosity-environmental density relation for radio galaxies in action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant radio galaxies (GRGs, giant RGs, or giants) are megaparsec-scale, jet-driven outflows from accretion disks of supermassive black holes, and represent the most extreme pathway by which galaxies can impact the Cosmic Web around them. A long-standing but unresolved question is why giants are so much larger than other radio galaxies. It has been proposed that, in addition to having higher jet powers than most RGs, giants might live in especially low-density Cosmic Web environments. In this work, we aim to test this hypothesis by pinpointing Local Universe giants and other RGs in physically principled, Bayesian large-scale structure reconstructions. More specifically, we localised a LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2-dominated sample of luminous ($l_\nu(\nu = 150\ \mathrm{MHz}) \geq 10^{24}\ \mathrm{W\ Hz^{-1}}$) giants and a control sample of LoTSS DR1 RGs, both with spectroscopic redshifts up to $z_\mathrm{max} = 0.16$, in the BORG SDSS Cosmic Web reconstructions. We measured the Cosmic Web density for each RG; for the control sample, we then quantified the relation between RG radio luminosity and Cosmic Web density. With the BORG SDSS tidal tensor, we also measured for each RG whether the gravitational dynamics of its Cosmic Web environment resemble those of clusters, filaments, sheets, or voids. Luminous giants populate large-scale environments that tend to be denser than those of general RGs. This shows that -- at least at high jet powers -- low-density environments are no prerequisite for giant growth. This result is corroborated by gravitational dynamics classification and a cluster catalogue crossmatching analysis. This work presents more than a thousand inferred megaparsec-scale densities around radio galaxies. Our findings are consistent with the view that giants are regular, rather than mechanistically special, members of the radio galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Observations of Galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ Allow to Test Cosmological Models with Features in the Initial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial power spectrum of density perturbations, generated during the inflationary epoch, is now constrained by observations on scales $\lambda&gt;5$~Mpc and has a power-law form. The peculiarities of the inflationary process can lead to the appearance of non-power-law contributions to this spectrum, such as peaks. The exact size and shape of the peak cannot be predicted in advance. In this paper, we propose methods for searching for such peaks in the region of the spectrum with $\lambda&lt;5$~Mpc. Perturbations on these scales enter the nonlinear stage at $z\gtrsim10$, which is now becoming accessible to observations. Our studies of numerical models of large-scale structure with peaks in the initial spectrum have shown that spectral features on scales with $\lambda&gt;0.1$~Mpc manifest in the clustering of galaxies, as well as affect their mass function, sizes, and density. Studying these characteristics of distant galaxies will allow us to constrain cosmological models with peaks.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Unbiased Reconstruction of CMB B Mode using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ingeniously designed autoencoder (PrimeNet) using simulated observations of future generation ECHO satellite mission recovers CMB B mode map, angular spectrum for multipoles $\ell \lesssim 9$ and tensor to scalar ratio $r$ {\it limited only by cosmic variance down to $r= 0.0001$ and below}. We use diverse, realistically complex and detailed foreground models. PrimeNet predicts accurate results even when data with $r=0$ are tested which were not used in training, implying robust and efficient predictive power. The work eliminates a major bottleneck of weak CMB B mode reconstruction and takes a leap forward for understanding fundamental physics of the primordial Universe.</description>

      <title>Enhancing dark siren cosmology through multi-band gravitational wave synergetic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-band gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations are poised to herald a new era in the study of cosmic evolution. These observations offer higher signal-to-noise ratios and improved localizations compared to those achieved with single-band GW detection, which are crucial for the cosmological applications of dark sirens. In this work, we explore the role multi-band GW synergetic observations will play in measuring cosmological parameters, particularly in comparison with single GW observatory data. We used mock multi-band dark siren data from third-generation GW detectors and the baseline Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory to infer cosmological parameters. Our analysis was conservative, involving only the 89 actual GW events from the current Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs in our data simulation, facilitating a direct comparison with existing dark siren results. Multi-band GW observations significantly improve sky localization accuracy by two to three orders of magnitude over single-band observations, although their impact on luminosity distance error remains limited. This results in a substantial improvement in the constraints on matter density and the Hubble constant, enhancing them by $75\%$ to $85\%$ and $65\%$ to $82\%$, respectively. We conclude that the significant potential of multi-band GW synergistic observations for detecting GW signals and resolving the Hubble tension is highly promising and warrants anticipation.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the matter power spectrum with future cosmic shear surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of cosmic shear typically condense weak lensing information over a range of scales to a single cosmological parameter, $S_8$. This paper presents a method to extract more information from Stage-IV cosmic shear measurements by directly reconstructing the matter power spectrum from linear to non-linear scales. We demonstrate that cosmic shear surveys will be sensitive to the shape of the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales. We show that it should be possible to distinguish between different models of baryonic feedback and we investigate the impact of intrinsic alignments and observational systematics on forecasted constraints. In addition to providing important information on galaxy formation, power spectrum reconstruction should provide a definitive answer to the question of whether weak lensing measurements of $S_8$ on linear scales are consistent with the $\textit{Planck}$ $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In addition, power spectrum reconstruction may lead to new discoveries on the composition of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Lensing Imprints of DES Y3 Superstructures on the CMB: A Matched Filtering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $ $Low density cosmic voids gravitationally lens the cosmic microwave background (CMB), leaving a negative imprint on the CMB convergence $\kappa$. This effect provides insight into the distribution of matter within voids, and can also be used to study the growth of structure. We measure this lensing imprint by cross-correlating the Planck CMB lensing convergence map with voids identified in the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data set, covering approximately 4,200 deg$^2$ of the sky. We use two distinct void-finding algorithms: a 2D void-finder which operates on the projected galaxy density field in thin redshift shells, and a new code, Voxel, which operates on the full 3D map of galaxy positions. We employ an optimal matched filtering method for cross-correlation, using the MICE N-body simulation both to establish the template for the matched filter and to calibrate detection significances. Using the DES Y3 photometric luminous red galaxy sample, we measure $A_\kappa$, the amplitude of the observed lensing signal relative to the simulation template, obtaining $A_\kappa = 1.03 \pm 0.22$ ($4.6\sigma$ significance) for Voxel and $A_\kappa = 1.02 \pm 0.17$ ($5.9\sigma$ significance) for 2D voids, both consistent with $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We additionally invert the 2D void-finding process to identify superclusters in the projected density field, for which we measure $A_\kappa = 0.87 \pm 0.15$ ($5.9\sigma$ significance). The leading source of noise in our measurements is Planck noise, implying that future data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT) and CMB-S4 will increase sensitivity and allow for more precise measurements.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Tsallis cosmology using recent low redshift measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Tsallis cosmology has been presented as a novel proposal for alleviating both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions. Hence a universe filled with matter and radiation as perfect fluids and considering the Tsallis entropy is confronted using recent cosmological measurements coming from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, hydrogen II galaxies, quasars, and baryon acoustic oscillations. Following a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and combining the samples, we constrain the main characteristic parameters $\alpha = 1.031^{+0.054}_{-0.051}$ and $\delta = 1.005^{+0.001}_{-0.001}$ where the uncertainties are $1\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we estimate the today deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.530^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift $z_T=0.632^{+0.028}_{-0.028}$ and the age of the universe $\tau_U = 12.637^{+0.067}_{-0.066}\,\rm{Gyrs}$ which are in agreement with the standard cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) within $1.5\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that the dark energy equation of state is consistent with both phantom and quintessence behaviors within $1\sigma$ in the past and converging to $\Lambda$CDM in the future. Finally, Tsallis cosmology is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data, suggesting further studies at the perturbation level.</description>

      <title>Spectral distortions from acoustic dissipation with non-Gaussian (or not) perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known route to form primordial black holes in the early universe relies on the existence of unusually large primordial curvature fluctuations, confined to a narrow range of wavelengths that would be too small to be constrained by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. This scenario would however boost the generation of $\mu$-type spectral distortions in the CMB due to an enhanced dissipation of acoustic waves. Previous studies of $\mu$-distortion bounds on the primordial spectrum were based on the assumptions of Gaussian primordial fluctuations. In this work, we push the calculation of $\mu$-distortions to one higher order in photon anisotropies. We discuss how to derive bounds on primordial spectrum peaks obeying non-Gaussian statistics under the assumption of local (perturbative or not) non-Gaussianity. We find that, depending on the value of the peak scale, the bounds may either remain stable or get tighter by several orders of magnitude, but only when the departure from Gaussian statistics is very strong. Our results are translated in terms of bounds on primordial supermassive black hole mass in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the origin of supermassive black holes via a primordial origin is severely challenged by the tight spectral distortion constraints on the amplitude of the primordial perturbations. Following the first calculation of how the $\mu$ constraints are modified by non-Gaussianity in a companion paper, we here make the first robust constraints on primordial black hole formation under large non-Gaussianity. Even the infinite $f_{\rm NL}$ limit is insufficiently non-Gaussian but much higher-order non-Gaussianity of the form ${\cal R}={\cal R}_{\rm G}^5$ may allow the formation of any mass primordial black hole without conflicting with distortion constraints. We caution that such extreme models face other challenges.</description>

      <title>Dark energy in light of recent DESI BAO and Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It might be necessary to access the impact of recent released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data on the state equation of dark energy in the Hubble-tension-free cosmologies. In this paper, we report the MCMC analysis for the $w_0w_a$CDM model with pre-recombination early dark energy (EDE) using Planck+DESI+Pantheon+SH0ES dataset. The results reveal that $H_0=72.43\pm 0.75$, $w_0=-0.971\pm0.035$, $w_a=-0.347\pm0.120$ for axion-like EDE, while $H_0=73.32\pm 0.64$, $w_0=-0.923\pm0.054$, $w_a=-0.435\pm0.132$ for AdS-EDE, and also not surprisingly the spectral index of primordial scalar perturbation moves towards $n_s=1$. It looks like that in corresponding models the bestfit $H_0$ are higher than those with pre-DESI BAO data, but without the further exacerbation of $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, collectively denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006, (cf. Ref.[41]) called the `$\Lambda$XCDM model', which was primordially designed to explain the cosmic coincidence problem. We now find that it can also have far reaching consequences on the current cosmological tensions on $H_0$ and the growth of large scale structure (LSS). The $\Lambda$XCDM may involve both a phantom-like component $X$ and a constant cosmological term $\Lambda$ (positive or negative) or even a running one, $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of the model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as `phantom matter' (PM). The latter appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution.</description>

Abstract: Galaxies that cause the strong gravitational lensing of background galaxies provide us crucial information about the distribution of matter around them. Traditional modelling methods that analyse such strong lenses are both time and resource consuming, require sophisticated lensing codes and modelling expertise. To study the large lens population expected from imaging surveys such as LSST, we need fast and automated analysis methods. In this work, we build and train a simple convolutional neural network with an aim to rapidly predict model parameters of gravitational lenses. We focus on the most important lens mass model parameters, namely, the Einstein radius, the axis ratio and the position angle of the major axis of the mass distribution. The network is trained on a variety of simulated data with an increasing degree of realism and shows satisfactory performance on simulated test data. The trained network is then applied to the real sample of galaxy-scale candidate lenses from the Subaru HSC, a precursor survey to LSST. Unlike the simulated lenses, we do not have the ground truth for the real lenses. Therefore, we have compared our predictions with those from YattaLens, a lens modelling pipeline. Additionally, we also compare the parameter predictions for 10 HSC lenses that were also studied by other conventional modelling methods. These comparisons show a fair quantitative agreement on the Einstein radius, although the axis ratio and the position angle from the network as well as the individual modelling methods, seem to have systematic uncertainties beyond the quoted errors.</description>

      <title>Adapting AREPO-RT for Exascale Computing: GPU Acceleration and Efficient Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer (RT) is a crucial ingredient for self-consistent modelling of numerous astrophysical phenomena across cosmic history. However, on-the-fly integration into radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations is computationally demanding, particularly due to the stringent time-stepping conditions and increased dimensionality inherent in multi-frequency collisionless Boltzmann physics. The emergence of exascale supercomputers, equipped with extensive CPU cores and GPU accelerators, offers new opportunities for enhancing RHD simulations. We present a novel optimization of AREPO-RT explicitly tailored for such high-performance computing environments. We implement a novel node-to-node communication strategy that utilizes shared memory to substitute intra-node communication with direct memory access. Furthermore, combining multiple inter-node messages into a single message substantially enhances network bandwidth utilization and performance for large-scale simulations on modern supercomputers. The single-message node-to-node approach also improves performance on smaller-scale machines with less optimized networks. Furthermore, by transitioning all RT-related calculations to GPUs, we achieve a significant computational speedup of around 15 for standard benchmarks compared to the original CPU implementation. As a case study, we perform cosmological RHD simulations of the Epoch of Reionization, employing a similar setup as the THESAN project. In this context, RT becomes sub-dominant such that even without modifying the core AREPO codebase, there is an overall threefold improvement in efficiency. The advancements presented here have broad implications, potentially transforming the complexity and scalability of future simulations for a wide variety of astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Radio Frequency Interference from Radio Navigation Satellite Systems: simulations and comparison to MeerKAT single-dish data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is emitted from various sources, terrestrial or orbital, and create a nuisance for ground-based 21cm experiments. In particular, single-dish 21cm intensity mapping experiments will be highly susceptible to contamination from these sources due to its wide primary beam and sensitivity. This work aims to simulate the contamination effects emitted from orbital sources in the Radio Navigational Satellite System within the 1100-1350 MHz frequency. This simulation can be split into two parts: (I) satellite positioning, emission power, and beam response on the telescope and (II) fitting of the satellite signal to data in order to improve the original model. We use previously observed single dish MeerKAT L-band data which needs to be specially calibrated to include data contaminated by satellite-based RFI. We find that due to non-linearity effects, it becomes non-trivial to fit the satellite power. However, when masking regions where this non-linearity is problematic, we can recreate the satellite contamination with high accuracy around its peak frequencies. The simulation can predict satellite movements and signal for past and future observations, which can help in RFI avoidance and testing novel cleaning methods. The predicted signal from simulations sits below the noise in the target cosmology window for the L-band (970 - 1015 MHz) making it difficult to confirm any out-of-band emission from satellites. However, a power spectrum analysis shows that such signal can still contaminate the 21cm power spectrum at these frequencies. In our simulations, this contamination overwhelms the auto-power spectrum but still allows for a clean detection of the signal in cross-correlations with mild foreground cleaning. Whether such contamination does exist one will require further characterization of the satellite signals far away from their peak frequencies.</description>

      <title>Superbubbles as the source of dynamical friction: gas migration, stellar and dark matter contributions</title>

Abstract: The gas distribution in galaxies is smooth on large scales but is usually inhomogeneous as well as time-dependent on smaller scales. The time-dependence originates from processes such as cloud formation, their collisions and supernovae (SNe) explosions. The inhomogeneities in the matter distribution give rise to variations in the local galactic gravitational potential, which can contribute towards dynamically coupling the gas disk to the stellar and the dark matter (DM) components of the galaxy. Specifically, multiple supernovae occurring in young stellar clusters give rise to superbubbles (SB), which modify the local acceleration field and alter the energy and momentum of stars of DM particles traversing them, in broad analogy to the dynamical friction caused by a massive object. We aim to quantify how the acceleration field from SBs causes dynamical friction and contributes to the secular evolution of galaxies. In order to assess this, we construct the density modifications to the gas distribution that mimics a SB. By evaluating the acceleration field from these density modifications, we see how the momentum or angular momentum of the gas hosting the SBs changes when stars pass through the SB. Combining the effects of all the stars and SBs we, construct an empirical approximation formula for the momentum loss in homogeneous and isotropic cases. We find that the rate at which the gas disc loses its specific angular momentum via the above process is up to 4% per Gyr, which translates to under half of its original value over the lifetime of the disc. Finally, we studied how the dynamical coupling of the gas disk with the DM halo depends on assumptions on the halo kinematics (e.g. rotation) and found a ~0.3% variation in the gas disc secular evolution between different DM kinematic models.</description>

      <title>Electrophilic scalar hair from rotating magnetized stars and effects of cosmic neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight electrophilic scalar field can mediate a long-range force or radiate from a pulsar or a magnetar if the scalar field has a coupling with the Goldreich-Julian charge density or the net electron charge density of the star. The interaction of the electron with the long-range scalar profile results in a spatial variation of the electron mass. A scalar induced magnetic field is created due to such interaction. The mass of the scalar in such cases is constrained by the radius of the star. The scalar field can also radiate from a binary system or an isolated star if the mass of the scalar is less than the orbital frequency and the spin frequency respectively. The electrophilic scalar radiation can contribute to the orbital period loss of binary systems and pulsar spin-down. Comparing with existing and projected experimental sensitivities, we obtain constraints on scalar coupling with ultralight mass. Some of these bounds are stronger than the existing fifth force constraints. The constraints on the scalar coupling can be significantly screened if the scalar has a coupling with the ubiquitous cosmic neutrino background. Improvements in experimental sensitivity and observations of compact objects with stronger magnetic fields and higher angular velocities could further refine these bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a flow-based method for simulating and calculating nucleation rates of first-order phase transitions in scalar field theory on a lattice. Motivated by recent advancements in machine learning tools, particularly normalizing flows for lattice field theory, we propose the ``partitioning flow-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (PFMCMC) sampling" method to address two challenges encountered in normalizing flow applications for lattice field theory: the ``mode-collapse" and ``rare-event sampling" problems. Using a (2+1)-dimensional real scalar model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our PFMCMC method in modeling highly hierarchical order parameter probability distributions and simulating critical bubble configurations. These simulations are then used to facilitate the calculation of nucleation rates. We anticipate the application of this method to (3+1)-dimensional theories for studying realistic cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Well-defined $f(Q)$ Gravity, Reconstruction of FLRW Spacetime and Unification of Inflation with Dark Energy Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the convenient and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravities in terms of the metric and four scalar fields with the $Q$ being the non-metricity scalar. As a result, it is shown that the obtained field equations are well-defined. By using the field equations, we show how the $f(Q)$ models which realise any given FLRW spacetime may be reconstructed. We construct convenient $f(Q)$ gravity and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravity, which describe the inflation and dark energy epochs and even unify the inflation and dark energy. Moreover, a radiation-dominated epoch and early dark energy may be easily included in the above theories as is explicitly shown. It is shown that the inflationary spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with Planck data for some models of $f(Q)$ gravity. Corresponding asymptotic forms of $f(Q)$ and mimetic $f(Q)$ are given. Finally, some remarks on possible reconstruction for spherically symmetric spacetime are given.</description>

Abstract: A popular science article designed to introduce people familiar with basic cosmological nomenclature with models alternative to cosmological inflation. The paper briefly discusses the modern view of the Big Bang model, inflation (both its advantages and potential deficiencies). This is followed by a discussion of historical alternative models and modern approaches such as matter bounce, ekpyrotic Universe, Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, Hartle-Hawking state and loop quantum cosmology. The final aspect of the paper is to present the advantages and potential problems associated with alternative models and to present the conceptual challenges associated with the uniqueness of cosmology as a specific domain of physics.</description>

      <title>No smooth spacetime: Exploring primordial perturbations in Lorentzian quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analysis of quantum cosmology has focused on the Lorentzian path integral formulations of both the no-boundary and tunneling proposals. However, it has been criticized that the wave function for linearized perturbations around a homogeneous and isotropic background leads to an inverse Gaussian distribution. This results in divergent correlation functions and cosmological inconsistencies. In this paper we explore these perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology, focusing in particular on the quantum creation of closed, flat, and open universes from no spacetime and the beginning of primordial inflation. We show that most quantum cosmological scenarios have serious perturbation problems. We also study the effects of trans-Planckian physics on quantum cosmology, using the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion as a case study of modified dispersion relations. Our findings indicate that resolving perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology with modified dispersion relations remains a challenge. However, the perturbations can be Gaussian in the quantum creation of the flat or open universe within the confines of the saddle-point approximation and the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Universe expansion rate is modulated around local inhomogeneities due to their gravitational potential. Velocity waves are then observed around galaxy clusters in the Hubble diagram. This paper studies them in a ~738 Mpc wide, with 2048^3 particles, cosmological simulation of our cosmic environment (a.k.a. CLONE: Constrained LOcal \&amp; Nesting Environment simulation). For the first time, the simulation shows that velocity waves that arise in the lines-of-sight of the most massive dark matter halos agree with those observed in local galaxy velocity catalogs in the lines-of-sight of Coma and several other local (Abell) clusters. For the best-constrained clusters such as Virgo and Centaurus, i.e. those closest to us, secondary waves caused by galaxy groups, further into the non-linear regime, also stand out. This match is not utterly expected given that before being evolved into a fully non-linear z=0 state, assuming {\Lambda}CDM, CLONE initial conditions are constrained with solely linear theory, power spectrum and highly uncertain and sparse local peculiar velocities. Additionally, Gaussian fits to velocity wave envelopes show that wave properties are tightly tangled with cluster masses. This link is complex though and involves the environment and formation history of the clusters. A proposed metric, measuring the distance between the observed and several re-centered simulated lines-of-sight, waves included, is shown to be capable of providing a tight mass range estimate for massive local clusters. Using machine learning techniques to grasp more thoroughly the complex wave-mass relation, velocity waves could in the near future be used to provide additional and independent mass estimates from galaxy dynamics within large cluster radii.</description>

      <title>Large-scale motions and growth rate from forward-modelling Tully-Fisher peculiar velocities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peculiar velocities are an important probe of the mass distribution in the Universe and the growth rate of structure, directly measuring the effects of gravity on the largest scales and providing a test for theories of gravity. Comparing peculiar velocities predicted from the density field mapped by a galaxy redshift survey with peculiar velocities measured using a distance estimator such as the Tully-Fisher relation yields the growth factor for large-scale structure. We present a method for forward-modelling a sample of galaxy magnitudes and velocity widths that simultaneously determines the parameters of the Tully-Fisher relation and the peculiar velocity field. We apply this to the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) Tully-Fisher dataset, using the peculiar velocities predicted from the 2M++ redshift survey. After validating the method on mock surveys, we measure the product of the growth rate and mass fluctuation amplitude to be $f\!\sigma_8$ = 0.35$\pm$0.03 at an effective redshift of $z$ = 0.017. This is consistent at 3$\sigma$ with the Planck CMB prediction, even though the uncertainty does not fully account for all sources of sample variance. We find the residual bulk flow from gravitational influences outside the 2M++ survey volume to be $|V|$ = 227$\pm$11 km/s, $(l,b)$ = (303$^\circ$,$-$1$^\circ$) in Galactic polar coordinates and the CMB frame. Using simulations, we show that applying our methodology to the large new sample of Tully-Fisher peculiar velocities expected from the WALLABY HI survey of the southern sky can improve the constraints on the growth rate by a factor of 2-3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One necessary step for probing the nature of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) particles with astrophysical observations is to pin down any possible velocity dependence in the SIDM cross section. Major challenges for achieving this goal include eliminating, or mitigating, the impact of the baryonic components and tidal effects within the dark matter halos of interest -- the effects of these processes can be highly degenerate with those of dark matter self-interactions at small scales. In this work we select 9 isolated galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with baryonic components small enough such that the baryonic gravitational potentials do not significantly influence the halo gravothermal evolution processes. We then constrain the parameters of Rutherford and Moller scattering cross section models with the measured rotation curves and stellar kinematics through the gravothermal fluid formalism and isothermal method. Cross sections constrained by the two methods are consistent at $1\sigma$ confidence level, but the isothermal method prefers cross sections greater than the gravothermal approach constraints by a factor of $\sim3$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIa. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. We present formulas for eigenmodes in orientable Euclidean manifolds with the topologies $E_{1}-E_{6}$, $E_{11}$, $E_{12}$, $E_{16}$, and $E_{18}$ that encompass the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the observed CMB sky. We find that topologies where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about 1.2 times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB give a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. This implies that if cosmic topology is the explanation of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, then the distance to our nearest clone is not much larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface. We argue that the topological information is likely to be better preserved in three-dimensional data, such as will eventually be available from large-scale structure surveys.</description>

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) simulations in cosmology, in particular when including baryons, can take millions of CPU hours. On the other hand, low-resolution (LR) dark matter simulations of the same cosmological volume use minimal computing resources. We develop a denoising diffusion super-resolution emulator for large cosmological simulation volumes. Our approach is based on the image-to-image Palette diffusion model, which we modify to 3 dimensions. Our super-resolution emulator is trained to perform outpainting, and can thus upgrade very large cosmological volumes from LR to HR using an iterative outpainting procedure. As an application, we generate a simulation box with 8 times the volume of the Illustris TNG300 training data, constructed with over 9000 outpainting iterations, and quantify its accuracy using various summary statistics.</description>

This is achieved using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae Pantheon+ samples and Baryon acoustic oscillations. In this parametrization, the value of the initial $q$ parameter is $q_{i}$, the final value is $q_f$, the present value is denoted by $q_{0}$, and the transition duration is given by $\alpha$. We perform our calculations using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method, utilizing the emcee package. Under the assumption of a flat geometry, we constrain the range of possible values for three scenarios: when $q_{f}$ is unrestricted, when $q_{f}$ is equal to $-1$, and when $\alpha$ is $1/3$. This is done assuming that $q_{i}=1/2$. Here, we achieve that the $SN$ data fixes the free parameters tightly as in the flat $\Lambda$CDM for unrestricted $q_{f}$. In addition, if we fix $q_{f}=-1$, the model behaves well as the $\Lambda$CDM for the combined dataset. We also acquire the current value of the deceleration parameter, which is consistent with the latest results that assume the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we observe a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the current model based on the evolution of $j(z)$, and it is evident that the universe transitions from deceleration to acceleration and will eventually reach the $\Lambda$CDM model in the near future.</description>

      <title>Scalable hierarchical BayeSN inference: Investigating dependence of SN Ia host galaxy dust properties on stellar mass and redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the hierarchical probabilistic SED model BayeSN to analyse a sample of 475 SNe Ia (0.015 &lt; z &lt; 0.4) from Foundation, DES3YR and PS1MD to investigate the properties of dust in their host galaxies. We jointly infer the dust law $R_V$ population distributions at the SED level in high- and low-mass galaxies simultaneously with dust-independent, intrinsic differences. We find an intrinsic mass step of $-0.049\pm0.016$ mag, at a significance of 3.1$\sigma$, when allowing for a constant intrinsic, achromatic magnitude offset. We additionally apply a model allowing for time- and wavelength-dependent intrinsic differences between SNe Ia in different mass bins, finding $\sim$2$\sigma$ differences in magnitude and colour around peak and 4.5$\sigma$ differences at later times. These intrinsic differences are inferred simultaneously with a difference in population mean $R_V$ of $\sim$2$\sigma$ significance, demonstrating that both intrinsic and extrinsic differences may play a role in causing the host galaxy mass step. We also consider a model which allows the mean of the $R_V$ distribution to linearly evolve with redshift but find no evidence for any evolution - we infer the gradient of this relation $\eta_R = -0.38\pm0.70$. In addition, we discuss in brief a new, GPU-accelerated Python implementation of BayeSN suitable for application to large surveys which is publicly available and can be used for future cosmological analyses; this code can be found here: https://github.com/bayesn/bayesn.</description>

      <title>Constraints on an Anisotropic Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the possibility of global anisotropy of the universe. We consider an altered Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker metric in which there are different scale factors along the three different axes of space. We construct the corresponding altered Friedmann equations. We show that any initial anisotropies decrease into the future. At late times, the difference in Hubble parameters changes as $1/\sqrt{t}$ in a radiation dominated era and as $1/t$ in a matter dominated era. We use constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the level of anisotropies at early times. We also examine how the approach back in time to the singularity is radically altered; happening much more abruptly, as a function of density, in an anisotropic universe. We also mention improved bounds that can arise from measurements of primordial gravitons, Weakly interacting massive particles, and neutrinos.</description>

      <title>New Insight Concerning Primordial Lithium Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To constrain the universe before recombination (380000 years after the Big Bang), we mostly rely on the measurements of the primordial abundances that indicate the first insight into the thermal history of the universe. The first production of the light elements is obtained by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The production of the elements deuterium, helium-3, and helium-4 during BBN matches well the observations; however, the production of lithium (Lithium-7) based on the Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (SBBN) is found to be higher by about a factor of three than the observed abundance from metal-poor halo stars. This so-called "Cosmological Lithium Problem" is still elusive and needs to be resolved. One important attempt to resolve this problem is to invoke a non-standard description of the SBBN to decrease the lithium abundance. In our previous work, we encountered a problem that the decrease in the Lithium-7 abundance requires an increase in the deuterium abundance to maximum values that are not accepted by observations. In the present work, a decrease in the lithium abundance could be achieved without maximizing the deuterium abundance by modifying the time-temperature relation in the range (0.43-0.91) GK during the nucleosynthesis process. This range is crucial to reducing the strong correlation between lithium and deuterium production. The main conclusion of the present work is that Lithium-7 abundance in the atmospheres of metal-poor stars cannot be analyzed without considering possible modifications to the primordial nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Interpreting DESI's evidence for evolving dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest results on baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument), when combined with cosmic microwave background and supernova data, show indications of a deviation from a cosmological constant in favour of evolving dark energy. Use of a pivot scale for the equation of state $w$ shows that this evidence is concentrated in the derivative of $w$ rather than its mean offset from $-1$, indicating a new cosmic coincidence where the mean equation of state matches that of the $\Lambda$CDM model precisely in the region probed by the observations. An equivalent way to express this is to say that the dark energy hits the maximum value that it will ever achieve within the observed window. We argue that conclusions on dark energy evolution are strongly driven by the assumed parameter priors and that this coincidence, which we are naming the PhantomX coincidence (where X stands for crossing), may be a signature of this.</description>

      <title>Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.668^{+0.180}_{-0.169}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 &gt; -1$ in DESI data confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We show that redshift bins of DESI constraints allow $\Omega_m$ to wiggle at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ level with increasing effective redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Bounds on Primordial Black Hole as Dark Matter with X-ray Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the mass range of $10^{16}-5\times 10^{18}$ g, primordial black holes (PBHs) persist as plausible candidates for dark matter. Our study involves a reassessment of the constraints on PBHs through a comparative analysis of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and the emissions arising from their Hawking evaporation. We identify previously overlooked radiation processes across the relevant energy bands, potentially refining the bounds on PBHs. These processes encompass the direct emission from Hawking radiation, in-flight annihilation, the final state of radiation, and positronium annihilation. Thorough consideration is given to all these processes and their respective emission fractions, followed by a precise calculation of the $\mathcal{D}$ factor for observations directed towards the high-latitude Galactic contribution. Furthermore, we integrate the flux originating from extragalactic sources, both of which contribute to the measured isotropic flux. Through a comparative analysis of data derived from previous CXB observations utilizing an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) double power-law model, we establish the most stringent constraints for PBHs, thereby excluding the possibility of PBHs constituting the entire dark matter mass within the range of $2.5\times 10^{17}-3 \times 10^{17} $g.</description>

      <title>LIGO-VIRGO constraints on dark matter and leptogenesis triggered by a first order phase transition at high scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of constraining a scenario with high scale first order phase transition (FOPT) responsible for the cogenesis of baryon and dark matter using gravitational wave (GW) (non)-observations. While the FOPT at high scale is responsible for generating baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis and dark matter via the \textit{mass-gain} mechanism, the resulting GW spectrum falls within the ongoing LIGO-VIRGO experimental sensitivity. The dark matter is preferred to be in the non-thermal ballpark with sub-GeV masses and the criteria of successful dark matter relic rules out a large portion of the parameter space consistent with high scale FOPT and successful leptogenesis. Some part of the parameter space allowed from dark matter and leptogenesis criteria also gives rise to a large signal-to-noise ratio at ongoing experiments and hence can be disfavoured in a conservative way from the non-observation of such stochastic GW background. Future data from ongoing and planned experiments will offer a complementary and indirect probe of the remaining parameter space which is typically outside the reach of any direct experimental probe.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Selection Rules: Optimising Axion Haloscopes for Gravitational Wave Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of electromagnetic fields, both axions and gravitational waves (GWs) induce oscillating magnetic fields: a potentially detectable fingerprint of their presence. We demonstrate that the response is largely dictated by the symmetries of the instruments used to search for it. Focussing on low mass axion haloscopes, we derive selection rules that determine the parametric sensitivity of different detector geometries to axions and GWs, and which further reveal how to optimise the experimental geometry to maximise both signals. The formalism allows us to forecast the optimal sensitivity to GWs in the range of 100 kHz to 100 MHz for instruments such as ABRACADABRA, BASE, ADMX SLIC, SHAFT, WISPLC, and DMRadio.</description>

      <title>Tracing the green valley with entropic thresholding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The green valley represents the population of galaxies that are transitioning from the actively star-forming blue cloud to the passively evolving red sequence. Studying the properties of the green valley galaxies is crucial for our understanding of the exact mechanisms and processes that drive this transition. The green valley does not have a universally accepted definition. The boundaries of the green valley are often determined by empirical lines that are subjective and vary across studies. We present an unambiguous definition of the green valley in the colour-stellar mass plane using the entropic thresholding. We first divide the galaxy population into the blue cloud and the red sequence based on a colour threshold that minimizes the intra-class variance and maximizes the inter-class variance. Our method splits the region between the mean colours of the blue cloud and the red sequence into three parts by maximizing the total entropy of that region. We repeat our analysis in a number of independent stellar mass bins to define the boundaries of the green valley in the colour-mass diagram. Our method provides a robust and natural definition of the green valley.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties and detectability of the magneto-thermal instability in the intracluster medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Amongst many plasma processes potentially relevant to the dynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM), turbulence driven at observable scales by internal magnetised buoyancy instabilities like the magneto-thermal instability (MTI) stand out in the ICM outskirt, where the background temperature decreases with radius. Aims. We characterise the statistical properties of MTI turbulence and assess whether such magnetised dynamics would be detectable with the future X-ray calorimeter X-IFU onboard ATHENA. Methods. We make use of scaling laws derived by Perrone &amp; Latter (2022a,b) to estimate the observable turbulent saturation levels and injection length of MTI turbulence for different ICM thermodynamic profiles, and perform a numerical MHD simulation of the dynamics with Braginskii heat and momentum diffusion. As a prospective exercise, we use the simulation to virtually observe MTI turbulence through the X-IFU. Results. In bright enough regions amenable to X-ray observations, the MTI drives mild turbulence up to $\sim$ 5% and $\sim$ 100 km/s (rms temperature fluctuation and velocity). However, the measurable integrated temperature fluctuation and line-of-sight velocity fields, which is essentially the azimuthal velocity component in cluster haloes, hardly exceed 1% and 10 km/s respectively. We show that such moderate signals would be hard to detect with upcoming X-ray telescopes. MTI turbulence is anisotropic in the direction of the gravity. If the fluctuation intensities were to be stronger than the current theoretical estimates, MTI fluctuations may be detectable and their anisotropy discernible with the X-IFU. Conclusions. Finding direct signatures of magnetised dynamics in the ICM, even at observable scales typical of the MTI, remains challenging. This study is a first step in this direction. Several numerical and observational strategies are discussed to make further progress.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is an excellent early universe laboratory for testing the fundamental properties of gravity. In this letter, we elucidate on the full potential of pulsar timing array (PTA) by utilizing cosmic variance-limited, or rather experimental noise-free, correlation measurements to understand the SGWB and by extension gravity. We show that measurements of the angular power spectrum play a pivotal role in the PTA precision era for scientific inferencing. In particular, we illustrate that cosmic variance-limited measurements of the first few power spectrum multipoles enable us to clearly set apart general relativity from alternative theories of gravity. This ultimately conveys that PTAs can be most ambitious for testing gravity in the nanohertz GW regime by zeroing in on the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ in the CMB and BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the effects of a light, very weakly-coupled boson $X$ arising from a spontaneously broken $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ as measured by the CMB and $Y_p$ from BBN. Our focus is the mass range $1 \; {\rm eV} \lesssim m_X \lesssim 100 \; {\rm MeV}$; masses lighter than about an ${\rm eV}$ have strong constraints from fifth-force law constraints, while masses heavier than about 100 MeV are constrained by other probes. We do not assume $X$ began in thermal equilibrium with the SM; instead, we allow $X$ to freeze-in from its very weak interactions with the SM. We find $U(1)_{B-L}$ is more strongly constrained by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ than previously considered. The bounds arise from the energy density in electrons and neutrinos slowly siphoned off into $X$ bosons, which become nonrelativistic, redshift as matter, and then decay, dumping their slightly larger energy density back into the SM bath causing $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &gt; 0$. While some of the parameter space has complementary constraints from stellar cooling, supernova emission, and terrestrial experiments, we find future CMB observatories can access regions of mass and coupling space not probed by any other method. In gauging $U(1)_{B-L}$, we assume the $[U(1)_{B-L}]^3$ anomaly is canceled by right-handed neutrinos, and so our $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ calculations have been carried out in two scenarios: neutrinos have Dirac masses, or, right-handed neutrinos acquire Majorana masses. In the latter scenario, we comment on the additional implications of thermalized right-handed neutrinos decaying during BBN. We also briefly consider the possibility that $X$ decays into dark sector states. If these states behave as radiation, we find weaker constraints, whereas if they are massive, there are stronger constraints, though now from $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently proposed that five-dimensional inflation can relate the causal size of the observable universe to the present weakness of gravitational interactions by blowing up an extra compact dimension from the microscopic fundamental length of gravity to a large size in the micron range, as required in the Dark Dimension proposal. Here, we compute the power spectrum of all primordial fluctuations emerging from a 5-dimensional inflaton in a slow-roll region of its potential, showing an interesting change of behaviour at large scales corresponding to angles larger than about 10 degrees in the sky.</description>

      <title>SKA Sensitivity to Sub-GeV Dark Matter Decay: Synchrotron Radio Emissions in White Dwarf Magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in detecting synchrotron radiation emitted from the decay of sub-GeV dark matter (dark matter with masses below the GeV scale) in the presence of strong magnetic fields. As a concrete setup, we consider scenarios where the magnetosphere of a magnetic white dwarf overlaps with dense dark matter environments, such as those surrounding a primordial black hole. Our study reveals that the encounters of compact objects such as white dwarfs and black holes offer a promising avenue for upcoming radio telescopes to probe the properties of light dark matter, which has been less explored compared with more conventional heavier (masses above the GeV scale) dark matter.</description>

      <title>Brightest Cluster Galaxy Offsets in Cold Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: The distribution of offsets between the brightest cluster galaxies of galaxy clusters and the centroid of their dark matter distributions is a promising probe of the underlying dark matter physics. In particular, since this distribution is sensitive to the shape of the potential in galaxy cluster cores, it constitutes a test of dark matter self-interaction on the largest mass scales in the universe. We examine these offsets in three suites of modern cosmological simulations; IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG and BAHAMAS. For clusters above $10^{14}\rm{M_\odot}$, we examine the dependence of the offset distribution on gravitational softening length, the method used to identify centroids, redshift, mass, baryonic physics, and establish the stability of our results with respect to various nuisance parameter choices. We find that offsets are overwhelmingly measured to be smaller than the minimum converged length scale in each simulation, with a median offset of $\sim 1\rm{kpc}$ in the highest resolution simulation considered, TNG300-1, which uses a gravitational softening length of $1.48\rm{kpc}$. We also find that centroids identified via source extraction on smoothed dark matter and stellar particle data are consistent with the potential minimum, but that observationally relevant methods sensitive to cluster strong gravitational lensing scales, or those using the the "light traces mass" approach, in this context meaning gas is used as a tracer for the potential, can overestimate offsets by factors of $\sim10$ and $\sim30$, respectively. This has the potential to reduce tensions with existing offset measurements which have served as evidence for a nonzero dark matter self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of a dark energy model in Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a cosmological model in Rastall's theory of gravity in the framework of the flat FLRW metric. We formulate the value of the Hubble parameter, which contains two model parameters, $ \alpha $ and $ j $. Employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, we determine the values of these model parameters along with their uncertainties. Moreover, we derive the equation of state (EoS) parameter, which converges around the quintessence region. We perform a dynamical system analysis using the linearization technique to validate the results independently. Also, we discuss various physical attributes of the model, highlighting the transition to acceleration and the violation of the strong energy condition (SEC) in the late stages of evolution. In conclusion, our model mimics the behavior of a dark matter fluid during the past epoch and transitions into a quintessence dark energy model in the future epoch.</description>

      <title>Comments Concerning a Hypothetical Mesoscopic Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by string-theoretic swampland conjectures, the existence of a dark fifth dimension, whose size is roughly 1 -- 10 microns, has been proposed. A great deal of supporting evidence has been presented, and definitive experimental tests are likely to be carried out. The basic idea is that the four-dimensional spacetime that we observe lives on a brane that is localized in the dark dimension. This short note points out that there are two distinct ways to realize such a scenario in string theory/M-theory. In the one considered previously the dark dimension is topologically a circle and our observable 4d spacetime is confined to a brane that is localized in a GUT-scale region of the circle. An alternative possibility is that the dark dimension is a line interval with branes attached at each end. This option would imply the existence of a parallel 4d spacetime microns away from us!</description>

      <title>Confusion of extragalactic sources in the far infrared: a baseline assessment of the performance of PRIMAger in intensity and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04320</link>

Abstract: Because of their limited angular resolution, far-infrared telescopes are usually affected by confusion phenomenon. Since several galaxies can be located in the same instrumental beam, only the brightest objects emerge from the fluctuations caused by fainter sources. The probe far-infrared mission for astrophysics imager (PRIMAger) will observe the mid- and far-infrared (25-235 $\mu$m) sky both in intensity and polarization. We aim to provide predictions of the confusion level and its consequences for future surveys. We produced simulated PRIMAger maps affected only by the confusion noise using the simulated infrared extragalactic sky (SIDES) semi-empirical simulation. We then estimated the confusion limit in these maps and extracted the sources using a basic blind extractor. By comparing the input galaxy catalog and the extracted source catalog, we derived various performance metrics as completeness, purity, and the accuracy of various measurements. In intensity, we predict that the confusion limit increases rapidly with increasing wavelength. The confusion limit in polarization is more than 100x lower. The measured flux density is dominated by the brightest galaxy in the beam, but other objects also contribute at longer wavelength (~30% at 235 $\mu$m). We also show that galaxy clustering has a mild impact on confusion in intensity (up to 25%), while it is negligible in polarization. In intensity, a basic blind extraction will be sufficient to detect galaxies at the knee of the luminosity function up to z~3 and 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ main-sequence galaxies up to z~5. In polarization for a conservative sensitivity, we expect ~8 000 detections up to z=2.5 opening a totally new window on the high-z dust polarization. Finally, we show that intensity surveys at short wavelength and polarization surveys at long wavelength tend to reach confusion at similar depth. There is thus a strong synergy.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Array Harmonic Analysis and Source Angular Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) influence the arrival times of radio signals coming from pulsars. Here, we investigate the harmonic space approach to describing a pulsar's response to GWs. We derive and discuss the "diagonalized form" of the response, which is a sum of spin-2-weighted spherical harmonics of the GW direction multiplied by normal (spin-weight 0) spherical harmonics of the pulsar direction. We show how this allows many useful objects, for example, the Hellings and Downs two-point function, to be easily calculated. The approach also provides a clear description of the gauge dependence. We then employ this harmonic approach to model the effects of angular correlations in the sky locations of GW sources (sometimes called "statistical isotropy"). To do this, we construct rotationally invariant ensembles made up of many Gaussian subensembles, each of which breaks rotational invariance. Using harmonic techniques, we compute the cosmic covariance and the total covariance of the Hellings and Downs correlation in these models. The results may be used to assess the impact of angular source correlations on the Hellings and Downs correlation, and for optimal reconstruction of the Hellings and Downs curve in models where GW sources have correlated sky locations.</description>
