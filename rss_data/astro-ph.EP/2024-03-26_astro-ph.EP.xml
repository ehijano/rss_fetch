      <title>Helium in Exoplanet Exospheres: Orbital and Stellar Influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for helium in the exospheres of exoplanets via the metastable near-infrared triplet have yielded 17 detections and 40 non-detections. We performed a comprehensive re-analysis of published studies to investigate the influence of stellar XUV flux and orbital parameters on the detectability of helium in exoplanetary atmospheres. We identified a distinct 'orbital sweet spot' for helium detection, 0.03 to 0.08 AU from the host star, where the majority of detections occurred. This sweet spot is influenced by the stellar XUV flux and planet size. Notably, a lower ratio of XUV flux to mid-UV flux is preferred for planets compared to non-detections. We also found that helium detections occur for planets around stars with effective temperatures of 4400-6500 K, with a sharp gap at 5400 to 6000 K, where no detections occur. Additionally, our analysis of the cumulative XUV flux versus escape velocity shows planets with helium detections are found above the 'cosmic shoreline', suggesting the shoreline needs revision. The trends we found in our analysis contribute to a deeper understanding of exosphere evolution.</description>

      <title>Stellar obliquity measurements of six gas giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One can infer the orbital alignment of exoplanets with respect to the spin of their host stars using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, thereby giving us the chance to test planet formation and migration theories and improve our understanding of the currently observed population. We analyze archival HARPS and HARPS-N spectroscopic transit time series of six gas giant exoplanets on short orbits, namely WASP-77 Ab, WASP-101b, WASP-103b, WASP-105b, WASP-120b and WASP-131b. We find a moderately misaligned orbit for WASP-101b ($\lambda =34\degree\ \pm$ 3) and a highly misaligned orbit for WASP-131b ($\lambda =161\degree\ \pm$ 5), while the four remaining ones appear aligned: WASP-77 Ab ($\lambda =-8\degree\ ^{+19}_{-18}$), WASP-103b ($\lambda =2\degree\ ^{+35}_{-36}$), WASP-105b ($\lambda =-14\degree\ ^{+28}_{-24}$), and WASP-120b ($\lambda =-2\degree\ \pm$ 4). For WASP-77 Ab, we were able to infer its true orbital obliquity ($\Psi =48\degree\ ^{+22}_{-21}$). We additionally perform transmission spectroscopy of the targets in search of strong atomic absorbers in the exoatmospheres, but are unable to detect any features, most likely due to the presence of high-altitude clouds or Rayleigh scattering muting the strength of the features. Finally, we comment on future perspectives for studying these targets with the upcoming space missions to investigate the evolution and migration histories of these planets.</description>

      <title>A link between the size and composition of comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All cometary nuclei that formed in the early Solar System incorporated radionuclides and therefore were subject to internal radiogenic heating. Previous work predicts that if comets have a pebble-pile structure internal temperature build-up is enhanced due to very low thermal conductivity, leading to internal differentiation. An internal thermal gradient causes widespread sublimation and migration of either ice condensates, or gases released from amorphous ice hosts during their crystallisation. Overall, the models predict that the degree of differentiation and re-distribution of volatile species to a shallower near-surface layer depends primarily on nucleus size. Hence, we hypothesise that cometary activity should reveal a correlation between the abundance of volatile species and the size of the nucleus. To explore this hypothesis we have conducted a thorough literature search for measurements of the composition and size of cometary nuclei, compiling these into a unified database. We report a statistically significant correlation between the measured abundance of CO/H$_{2}$O and the size of cometary nuclei. We further recover the measured slope of abundance as a function of size, using a theoretical model based on our previous thermophysical models, invoking re-entrapment of outward migrating high volatility gases in the near-surface pristine amorphous ice layers. This model replicates the observed trend and supports the theory of internal differentiation of cometary nuclei by early radiogenic heating. We make our database available for future studies, and we advocate for collection of more measurements to allow more precise and statistically significant analyses to be conducted in the future.</description>

      <title>Dome Craters on Ganymede and Callisto May Form by Topographic Relaxation of Pit Craters Aided by Remnant Impact Heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The icy Galilean satellites display impact crater morphologies that are rare in the Solar System. They deviate from the archetypal sequence of crater morphologies as a function of size found on rocky bodies and other icy satellites: they exhibit central pits in place of peaks, followed by central dome craters, anomalous dome craters, penepalimpsests, palimpsests, and multi-ring structures. Understanding the origin of these features will provide insight into the geophysical factors that operate within the icy Galilean satellites. Pit craters above a size threshold feature domes. This trend, and the similarity in morphology between the two classes, suggests a genetic link between pit and dome craters. We propose that dome craters evolve from pit craters through topographic relaxation, facilitated by remnant heat from the impact. Our finite element simulations show that, for the specific crater sizes where we see domes on Ganymede and Callisto, domes form from pit craters within 10 Myr. Topographic relaxation acts to eliminate the stresses induced by crater topography and restore a flat surface: ice flows downwards from the rim and upwards from the crater depression driven by gravity. When the starting topography is a pit crater, the heat left over from the impact is concentrated below the pit. Since warm ice flows more rapidly, the upward flow is enhanced beneath the pit, leading to the emergence of a dome. Given the timescales and the dependence on heat flux, this model could be used to constrain the thermal history and evolution of these moons.</description>

      <title>Sub-Micrometer Particles Remote Detection in Enceladus Plume Based on Cassinis UV Spectrograph Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enceladus is the Saturnian satellite known to have water vapor erupting from its south pole region called Tiger Stripes. Data collected by Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph during Enceladus transiting Saturn allow us to estimate water plume absorption from 1115.35 - 1912.50 Angstrom and compare it to the Mie solutions of Maxwell equations for particles with a diameter in the range from 10 nm up to 2 um. The best fit performed using Gradient Descent method indicates a presence of submicrometer particles of diameters: 120-180 nm and 240-320 nm consistent with Thermofilum sp., Thermoproteus sp., and Pyrobaculum sp. cell sizes present in hydrothermal vents on Earth.</description>

      <title>Modeling Circumstellar Gas Emission around a White Dwarf Using Cloudy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical composition of an extrasolar planet is fundamental to its formation, evolution and habitability. In this study, we explore a new way to measure the chemical composition of the building blocks of extrasolar planets, by measuring the gas composition of the disrupted planetesimals around white dwarf stars. As a first attempt, we used the photo-ionization code Cloudy to model the circumstellar gas emission around a white dwarf Gaia J0611$-$6931 under some simplified assumptions. We found most of the emission lines are saturated and the line ratios approaching the ratios of thermal emission; therefore only lower limits to the number density can be derived. Silicon is the best constrained element in the circumstellar gas and we derived a lower limit of 10$^{10.3}$ cm$^{-3}$. In addition, we placed a lower limit on the total amount of gas to be 1.8 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ g. Further study is needed to better constrain the parameters of the gas disk and connect it to other white dwarfs with circumstellar gas absorption.</description>

      <title>Parallax Effect in Microlensing Events due to Free-Floating Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of most important applications of microlensing observations is detecting free-floating planets(FFPs). The time scale of microlensing due to FFPs ($t_{\rm E}$) is short (a few days). Discerning the annual parallax effect in observations from these short-duration events by one observer is barely possible, though their parallax amplitude is larger than that in common events. In microlensing events due to FFPs, the lens-source relative trajectory alters because of the observer's motion by $\boldsymbol{\delta u}$. This deviation is a straight line if $t_{\rm E} \ll P_{\oplus}$, and its size is $\delta u\propto \pi_{\rm{rel}}$ ($P_{\oplus}$ is the observer's orbital period). So, most of observed microlensing events due to close FFPs have simple Paczy\'nsky lightcurves with indiscernible and valuable parallax. To evaluate destructive effects of invisible parallax in such events, we simulate $\sim9650$ microlensing events due to FFPs with $t_{\rm E}&lt;10$ days that are observed only by The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope(\wfirst). We conclude that in half of these microlensing events the missing parallax alters the real lightcurves, changing their shape and derived properties(by $\Delta \chi^{2}\gtrsim100$). By fitting Paczy\'nski lightcurves to these affected events we evaluate the relative and dimensionless deviations in the lensing parameters from their real values ($\delta t_{\rm E}, \delta \rho_{\star}, ...$). We conclude that around $46$ FFPs which are discovered by \wfirst\ have lightcurves highly affected by invisible parallax with $\delta t_{\rm E}&gt;0.1~\rm{and}~\delta \rho_{\star}&gt;0.1$. Our study reveals the importance of simultaneous and dense observations of microlensing events viewed by \wfirst\ by other observers rotating the Sun in different orbits.</description>

      <title>Can Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity be different from the deep interior?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Updated formation and structure models of Jupiter predict a metal-poor envelope. This is at odds with the two to three times solar metallicity measured by the Galileo probe. Additionally, Juno data imply that water and ammonia are enriched. Here we explore whether Jupiter can have a deep radiative layer separating the atmosphere from the deeper interior. The radiative layer could be caused by a hydrogen-transparency window or depletion of alkali metals. We show that heavy-element accretion during Jupiter's evolution can lead to the desired atmospheric enrichment and that this configuration is stable over billions of years. The origin of the heavy elements could be cumulative small impacts or one large impact. The preferred scenario requires a deep radiative zone due to a local reduction of the opacity at $\sim$ 2000 K by $\sim$ 90%, which is supported by Juno data, and vertical mixing through the boundary with a similar efficiency to molecular diffusion ($D \lesssim 10^{-2}$ cm$^2$/s). Therefore, most of Jupiter's molecular envelope could have solar composition while its uppermost atmosphere is enriched with heavier elements. The enrichment likely originates from the accretion of solid objects. This possibility resolves the long-standing mismatch between Jupiter's interior models and atmospheric composition measurements. Furthermore, our results imply that the measured atmospheric composition of exoplanets does not necessarily reflect their bulk compositions. We also investigate whether the enrichment could be due to the erosion of a dilute core and show that this is highly unlikely. The core-erosion scenario is inconsistent with evolution calculations, the deep radiative layer, and published interior models.</description>

      <title>ethraid: A simple method for characterizing long-period companions using Doppler, astrometric, and imaging constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \texttt{ethraid}, an open source Python package designed to measure the mass ($m_c$) and separation ($a$) of a bound companion from measurements covering a fraction of the orbital period. \texttt{ethraid} constrains $m_c$ and $a$ by jointly modeling radial velocity (RV), astrometric, and/or direct imaging data in a Bayesian framework. Partial orbit data sets, especially those with highly limited phase coverage, are well-represented by a few method-specific summary statistics. By modeling these statistics rather than the original data, \texttt{ethraid} optimizes computational efficiency with minimal reduction in accuracy. \texttt{ethraid} uses importance sampling to efficiently explore the often broad posteriors that arise from partial orbits. The core computations of \texttt{ethraid} are implemented in Cython for speed. We validate \texttt{ethraid}'s performance by using it to constrain the masses and separations of the planetary companions to HD 117207 and TOI-1694. We designed \texttt{ethraid} to be both fast and simple, and to give broad, "quick look" constraints on companion parameters using minimal data. \texttt{ethraid} is pip installable and available on Github.</description>

      <title>Follow-up LOFAR observations of the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Observing the radio emission from exoplanets is among the most promising methods to detect their magnetic fields and a measurement of an exoplanetary magnetic field will help constrain the planet's interior structure, star-planet interactions, atmospheric escape and dynamics, and habitability. Recently, circularly polarized bursty and slow emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis ($\tau$ Boo) exoplanetary system was tentatively detected using LOFAR (LOW-Frequency ARray) beamformed observations. If confirmed, this detection will be a major contribution to exoplanet science. However, follow-up observations are required to confirm this detection.
  Aims. Here, we present such follow-up observations of the $\tau$ Boo system using LOFAR. These observations cover 70$\%$ of the orbital period of $\tau$ Boo b including the orbital phases of the previous tentative detections.
  Methods. We used the BOREALIS pipeline to mitigate radio frequency interference and to search for bursty and slowing varying radio signals. BOREALIS was previously used to find the tentative radio signals from $\tau$ Boo.
  Results. Our new observations do not show any signs of bursty or slow emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system.
  Conclusions. The cause for our non-detection is currently degenerate. It is possible that the tentative radio signals were an unknown instrumental systematic or that we are observing variability in the planetary radio emission due to changes in its host star. More radio data (preferably multi-site) and ancillary observations (e.g. magnetic maps) are required to further investigate the potential radio emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system.</description>

      <title>Wide-Spectral-Band Nuller Insensitive to Finite Stellar Angular Diameter with a One-Dimensional Diffraction-Limited Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potentially habitable planets around nearby stars less massive than solar-type stars could join targets of the spectroscopy of the planetary reflected light with future space telescopes. However, the orbits of most of these planets occur near the diffraction limit for 6-m-diameter telescopes. Thus, while securing contrast-mitigation ability under a broad spectral bandwidth and a finite stellar angular diameter, we must maintain planetary throughput even at the diffraction-limited angles to be able to reduce the effect of the photon noise within a reasonable observation time. A one-dimensional diffraction-limited coronagraph (1DDLC) observes planets near the diffraction limit with undistorted point spread functions but has a finite-stellar diameter problem in wideband use. This study presents a method for wide-spectral-band nulling insensitive to stellar-angular-diameter by adding a fiber nulling with a Lyot-plane phase mask to the 1DDLC. Designing the pattern of the Lyot-plane mask function focuses on the parity of the amplitude spread function of light. Our numerical simulation shows that the planetary throughput (including the fiber-coupling efficiency) can reach about 11% for about 1.35-$\lambda/D$ planetary separation almost independently of the spectral bandwidth. The simulation also shows the raw contrast of about $4\times10^{-8}$ (the spectral bandwidth of 25%) and $5\times10^{-10}$ (the spectral bandwidth of 10%) for $3\times 10^{-2}$ $\lambda/D$ stellar angular diameter. The planetary throughput depends on the planetary azimuthal angle, which may degrade the exploration efficiency compared to an isotropic throughput but is partially offset by the wide spectral band.</description>

      <title>Precise characterisation of HD 15337 with CHEOPS: a laboratory for planet formation and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to constrain the internal structure and composition of HD 15337 b and c, two short-period planets situated on opposite sides of the radius valley, using new transit photometry and radial velocity data. We acquire 6 new transit visits with the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) and 32 new radial velocity measurements from the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) to improve the accuracy of the mass and radius estimates for both planets. We reanalyse light curves from TESS sectors 3 and 4 and analyse new data from sector 30, correcting for long-term stellar activity. Subsequently, we perform a joint fit of the TESS and CHEOPS light curves, and all available RV data from HARPS and the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS). Our model fits the planetary signals, the stellar activity signal and the instrumental decorrelation model for the CHEOPS data simultaneously. The stellar activity was modelled using a Gaussian-process regression on both the RV and activity indicators. We finally employ a Bayesian retrieval code to determine the internal composition and structure of the planets. We derive updated and highly precise parameters for the HD 15337 system. Our improved precision on the planetary parameters makes HD 15337 b one of the most precisely characterised rocky exoplanets, with radius and mass measurements achieving a precision better than 2\% and 7\%, respectively. We are able to improve the precision of the radius measurement of HD 15337 c to 3\%. Our results imply that the composition of HD 15337 b is predominantly rocky, while HD 15337 c exhibits a gas envelope with a mass of at least $0.01\ M_\oplus$.Our results lay the groundwork for future studies, which can further unravel the atmospheric evolution of these exoplanets and give new insights into their composition and formation history and the causes behind the radius gap.</description>

      <title>An Observational View of Structure in Protostellar Systems</title>

Abstract: The envelopes and disks that surround protostars reflect the initial conditions of star and planet formation and govern the assembly of stellar masses. Characterizing these structures requires observations that span the near-infrared to centimeter wavelengths. Consequently, the past two decades have seen progress driven by numerous advances in observational facilities across this spectrum, including the \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}, \textit{Herschel Space Observatory}, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and a host of other ground-based interferometers and single-dish radio telescopes. Nearly all protostars appear to have well-formed circumstellar disks that are likely to be rotationally-supported; the ability to detect a disk around a protostar is more a question of spatial resolution than whether or not a disk is present. The disks around protostars have inherently higher millimeter/submillimeter luminosities as compared to disks around more-evolved pre-main sequence stars, though there may be systematic variations between star forming regions. The envelopes around protostars are inherently asymmetric and streamers emphasize that mass flow through the envelopes to the disks may not be homogeneous. The current mass distribution of protostars may be impacted by selection bias given that it is skewed toward solar-mass protostars, inconsistent with the stellar initial mass function.</description>

      <title>The First High-Contrast Images of Near High-Mass X-Ray Binaries with Keck/NIRC2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the study of X-ray binaries has led to major breakthroughs in high-energy astrophysics, their circumbinary environment at scales of $\sim$100--10,000 astronomical units has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we undertake a novel and exploratory study by employing direct and high-contrast imaging techniques on a sample of X-ray binaries, using adaptive optics and the vortex coronagraph on Keck/NIRC2. High-contrast imaging opens up the possibility to search for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, circumbinary companion stars, and protoplanetary disks in these extreme systems. Here, we present the first near-infrared high-contrast images of 13 high-mass X-ray binaries located within $\sim$2--3 kpc. The key results of this campaign involve the discovery of several candidate circumbinary companions ranging from sub-stellar (brown dwarf) to stellar masses. By conducting an analysis based on galactic population models, we discriminate sources that are likely background/foreground stars and isolate those that have a high probability ($\gtrsim 60 - 99\%$) of being gravitationally bound to the X-ray binary. This publication seeks to establish a preliminary catalog for future analyses of proper motion and subsequent observations. With our preliminary results, we calculate the first estimate of the companion frequency and the multiplicity frequency for X-ray binaries: $\approx$0.6 and 1.8 $\pm$ 0.9 respectively, considering only the sources that are most likely bound to the X-ray binary. In addition to extending our comprehension of how brown dwarfs and stars can form and survive in such extreme systems, our study opens a new window to our understanding of the formation of X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Expanding the frontiers of cool-dwarf asteroseismology with ESPRESSO. Detection of solar-like oscillations in the K5 dwarf $\epsilon$ Indi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuelled by space photometry, asteroseismology is vastly benefitting the study of cool main-sequence stars, which exhibit convection-driven solar-like oscillations. Even so, the tiny oscillation amplitudes in K dwarfs continue to pose a challenge to space-based asteroseismology. A viable alternative is offered by the lower stellar noise over the oscillation timescales in Doppler observations. In this letter we present the definite detection of solar-like oscillations in the bright K5 dwarf $\epsilon$ Indi based on time-intensive observations collected with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT, thus making it the coolest seismic dwarf ever observed. We measured the frequencies of a total of 19 modes of degree $\ell=0$--2 along with $\nu_{\rm max}=5305\pm176\:{\rm \mu Hz}$ and $\Delta\nu=201.25\pm0.16\:{\rm \mu Hz}$. The peak amplitude of radial modes is $2.6\pm0.5\:{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$, or a mere ${\sim} 14\%$ of the solar value. Measured mode amplitudes are ${\sim} 2$ times lower than predicted from a nominal $L/M$ scaling relation and favour a scaling closer to $(L/M)^{1.5}$ below ${\sim} 5500\:{\rm K}$, carrying important implications for our understanding of the coupling efficiency between pulsations and near-surface convection in K dwarfs. This detection conclusively shows that precise asteroseismology of cool dwarfs is possible down to at least the mid-K regime using next-generation spectrographs on large-aperture telescopes, effectively opening up a new domain in observational asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Modeling the secular evolution of embedded protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Protoplanetary discs are known to form around nascent stars from their parent molecular cloud as a result of angular momentum conservation. As they progressively evolve and dissipate, they also form planets. While a lot of modeling efforts have been dedicated to their formation, the question of their secular evolution, from the so-called class 0 embedded phase to the class II phase where discs are believed to be isolated, remains poorly understood. Aims: We aim to explore the evolution between the embedded stages and the class II stage. We focus on the magnetic field evolution and the long-term interaction between the disc and the envelope. Methods: We use the GPU-accelerated code \textsc{Idefix} to perform a 3D, barotropic, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) secular core collapse simulation that covers the system evolution from the collapse of the pre-stellar core until 100 kyr after the first hydrostatic core formation and the disc settling while ensuring sufficient vertical and azimuthal resolutions (down to $10^{-2}$ au) to properly resolve the disc internal dynamics and non-axisymmetric perturbations. Results: The disc evolution leads to a power-law gas surface density in Keplerian rotation that extends up to a few 10 au. The magnetic flux trapped in the disc during the initial collapse decreases from 100 mG at disc formation down to 1 mG by the end of the simulation. After the formation of the first hydrostatic core, the system evolves in three phases. A first phase with a small ($\sim 10$ au), unstable, strongly accreting ($\sim10^{-5}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$) disc that loses magnetic flux over the first 15 kyr, a second phase where the magnetic flux is advected with a smooth, expanding disc fed by the angular momentum of the infalling material...</description>

      <title>Direct detection and characterization of exoplanets using imaging Fourier transform spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-based direct imaging provides prospects for detection and spectral characterization of exoplanets at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Integral field spectrographs (IFS) have been historically baselined for these mission concepts. However, multiple studies have revealed that detector noise is a serious obstacle for such instruments when observing extremely faint targets such as Earth-like planets. Imaging Fourier transform spectrographs (iFTS) are generally less sensitive to detector noise, and have several other compelling features such as simultaneous imaging and spectroscopy, smaller-format detector requirements, and variable spectral resolution. To date, they have not been studied as options for such missions.
  In this work, we compare the capabilities of integral field spectrographs and imaging Fourier transform spectrographs to directly obtain spectra from an Earth-like planet using analytic and numerical models. Specifically, we compare the required exposure time to achieve the same signal-to-noise ratio of the two architectures over a range of detector and optical system parameters. We find that for a 6-meter telescope, an IFS outperforms an iFTS at optical wavelengths. In the near-IR, the relative efficiency of an IFS and iFTS depends on the instrument design and detector noise. An iFTS will be more efficient than an IFS if the readout noise of near-IR detector is above 2-3 e-/pix/frame (t_frame=1000s), which correspond to half to one-third of detector noise of the state-of-art. However, if the readout noise is further reduced to below this threshold, the performance of an IFS will experience a substantial improvement and become more efficient. These results motivate consideration of an iFTS as an alternative option for future direct imaging space missions in the near-IR.</description>

      <title>The Composition and Chemistry of Titan's Atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article I summarize the current state of knowledge about the composition of Titan's atmosphere, and our current understanding of the suggested chemistry that leads to that observed composition. I begin with our present knowledge of the atmospheric composition, garnered from a variety of measurements including Cassini-Huygens, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and other ground and space-based telescopes. This review focuses on the typical vertical profiles of gases at low latitudes, rather than global and temporal variations. The main body of the paper presents a chemical description of how complex molecules are believed to arise from simpler species, considering all known 'stable' molecules - those that have been uniquely identified in the neutral atmosphere. The last section of the paper is devoted to the gaps in our present knowledge of Titan's chemical composition and how further work may fill those gaps.</description>

      <title>New constraints on Triton's atmosphere from the 6 October 2022 stellar occultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atmosphere of Triton was probed directly by observing a ground-based stellar occultation on 6 October 2022. This rare event yielded 23 positive light curves collected from 13 separate observation stations contributing to our campaign. The significance of this event lies in its potential to directly validate the modest pressure fluctuation on Triton, a phenomenon not definitively verified by previous observations, including only five stellar occultations, and the Voyager 2 radio occultation in 1989. Using an approach consistent with a comparable study, we precisely determined a surface pressure of $14.07_{-0.13}^{+0.21}~\mathrm{\mu bar}$ in 2022. This new pressure rules out any significant monotonic variation in pressure between 2017 and 2022 through direct observations, as it is in alignment with the 2017 value. Additionally, both the pressures in 2017 and 2022 align with the 1989 value. This provides further support for the conclusion drawn from the previous volatile transport model simulation, which is consistent with the observed alignment between the pressures in 1989 and 2017; that is to say, the pressure fluctuation is modest. Moreover, this conclusion suggests the existence of a northern polar cap extended down to at least $45^\circ$N$-60^\circ$N and the presence of nitrogen between $30^\circ$S and $0^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Episodic eruptions of young accreting stars: the key role of disc thermal instability due to Hydrogen ionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical grouping of large magnitude episodic variability of young accreting stars, FUORs outshine their stars by a factor of $\sim$ 100, and can last for up to centuries; EXORs are dimmer, and last months to a year. A disc Hydrogen ionisation Thermal Instability (TI) scenario was previously proposed for FUORs but required unrealistically low disc viscosity. In the last decade, many intermediate type objects, e.g., FUOR-like in luminosity and spectra but EXOR-like in duration were found. Here we show that the intermediate type bursters Gaia20eae, PTF14jg, Gaia19bey and Gaia21bty may be naturally explained by the TI scenario with realistic viscosity values. We argue that TI predicts a dearth (desert) of bursts with peak accretion rates between $\dot M \sim 10^{-6} M_\odot$/yr and $\dot M \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$/yr, and that this desert is seen in the sample of all the bursters with previously determined $\dot M$ burst. Most classic EXORs (FUORs) appear to be on the cold (hot) branch of the S-curve during the peak light of their eruptions; thus TI may play a role in this class differentiation. At the same time, TI is unable to explain how classic FUORs can last for up to centuries, and over-predicts the occurrence rate of short FUORs by at least an order of magnitude. We conclude that TI is a required ingredient of episodic accretion operating at R &lt; 0.1 au, but additional physics must play a role at larger scales. Knowledge of TI inner workings from related disciplines may enable its use as a tool to constrain the nature of this additional physics.</description>
