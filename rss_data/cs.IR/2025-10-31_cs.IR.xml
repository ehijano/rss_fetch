      <title>ORBIT - Open Recommendation Benchmark for Reproducible Research with Hidden Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services, or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models. ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard. Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco, featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages. ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12 representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets, with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT benchmark, leaderboard, and codebase are available at https://www.open-reco-bench.ai.</description>

      <title>OneTrans: Unified Feature Interaction and Sequence Modeling with One Transformer in Industrial Recommender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g., Wukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has achieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans, a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.</description>

      <title>ReaKase-8B: Legal Case Retrieval via Knowledge and Reasoning Representations with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another, mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems. The code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/ReaKase-8B.</description>

      <title>DiSE: A diffusion probabilistic model for automatic structure elucidation of organic compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic structure elucidation is essential for self-driving laboratories as it enables the system to achieve truly autonomous. This capability closes the experimental feedback loop, ensuring that machine learning models receive reliable structure information for real-time decision-making and optimization. Herein, we present DiSE, an end-to-end diffusion-based generative model that integrates multiple spectroscopic modalities, including MS, 13C and 1H chemical shifts, HSQC, and COSY, to achieve automated yet accurate structure elucidation of organic compounds. By learning inherent correlations among spectra through data-driven approaches, DiSE achieves superior accuracy, strong generalization across chemically diverse datasets, and robustness to experimental data despite being trained on calculated spectra. DiSE thus represents a significant advance toward fully automated structure elucidation, with broad potential in natural product research, drug discovery, and self-driving laboratories.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Context-Aware Embeddings for GAT-Based Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with data sparsity and cold-start scenarios, limiting their ability to provide accurate suggestions for new or infrequent users. This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM) driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance further.</description>

      <title>WeaveRec: An LLM-Based Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation Framework with Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user preference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite the progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or items to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in real-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and model-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying multi-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows that naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several domain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained solely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first experimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based cross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we introduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and target domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging. WeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not introduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the upper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments on single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation scenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>ProfOlaf: Semi-Automated Tool for Systematic Literature Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic reviews and mapping studies are critical for synthesizing research, identifying gaps, and guiding future work, but they are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. Existing tools provide partial support for specific steps, leaving much of the process manual and error-prone. We present ProfOlaf, a semi-automated tool designed to streamline systematic reviews while maintaining methodological rigor. ProfOlaf supports iterative snowballing for article collection with human-in-the-loop filtering and uses large language models to assist in analyzing articles, extracting key topics, and answering queries about the content of papers. By combining automation with guided manual effort, ProfOlaf enhances the efficiency, quality, and reproducibility of systematic reviews across research fields. A video describing and demonstrating ProfOlaf is available at: https://youtu.be/4noUXfcmxsE</description>

      <title>The Quest for Reliable Metrics of Responsible AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including AI in Science (AIS), should be done following the principles of responsible AI. Progress in responsible AI is often quantified through evaluation metrics, yet there has been less work on assessing the robustness and reliability of the metrics themselves. We reflect on prior work that examines the robustness of fairness metrics for recommender systems as a type of AI application and summarise their key takeaways into a set of non-exhaustive guidelines for developing reliable metrics of responsible AI. Our guidelines apply to a broad spectrum of AI applications, including AIS.</description>

      <title>GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks, GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.</description>

      <title>LINK-KG: LLM-Driven Coreference-Resolved Knowledge Graphs for Human Smuggling Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans, leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks.</description>

      <title>Inside CORE-KG: Evaluating Structured Prompting and Coreference Resolution for Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze. Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex legal texts.</description>

      <title>AdSum: Two-stream Audio-visual Summarization for Automated Video Advertisement Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve, Spearman, and Kendall.</description>

      <title>RecCocktail: A Generalizable and Efficient Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in recent years, owing to their impressive generalization capabilities and rich world knowledge. To capitalize on the potential of using LLMs as recommender systems, mainstream approaches typically focus on two paradigms. The first paradigm designs multi-domain or multi-task instruction data for generalizable recommendation, so as to align LLMs with general recommendation areas and deal with cold-start recommendation. The second paradigm focuses on enhancing domain-specific recommendation tasks, improving performance in warm recommendation scenarios. While most previous works treat these two paradigms separately, we argue that they have complementary advantages, and combining them can yield better results. In this paper, we propose a generalizable and efficient LLM-based recommendation framework RecCocktail. Our approach begins with fine-tuning a "base spirit" LoRA module using domain-general recommendation instruction data to align LLM with recommendation knowledge. Next, given users' behavior of a specific domain, we construct a domain-specific "ingredient" LoRA module. We then provide an entropy-guided adaptive merging method to mix the "base spirit" and the "ingredient" in the weight space. Please note that, RecCocktail combines the advantages of the existing two paradigms without introducing additional time or space overhead during the inference phase. Moreover, RecCocktail is efficient with plug and play, as the "base spirit" LoRA is trained only once, and any domain-specific "ingredient" can be efficiently mixed with only domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under both warm and cold-start recommendation scenarios validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed RecCocktail.</description>

      <title>A Task-Centric Perspective on Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many studies in recommender systems (RecSys) adopt a general problem definition, i.e., to recommend preferred items to users based on past interactions. Such abstraction often lacks the domain-specific nuances necessary for practical deployment. However, models are frequently evaluated using datasets collected from online recommender platforms, which inherently reflect domain or task specificities. In this paper, we analyze RecSys task formulations, emphasizing key components such as input-output structures, temporal dynamics, and candidate item selection. All these factors directly impact offline evaluation. We further examine the complexities of user-item interactions, including decision-making costs, multi-step engagements, and unobservable interactions, which may influence model design. Additionally, we explore the balance between task specificity and model generalizability, highlighting how well-defined task formulations serve as the foundation for robust evaluation and effective solution development. By clarifying task definitions and their implications, this work provides a structured perspective on RecSys research. The goal is to help researchers better navigate the field, particularly in understanding specificities of the RecSys tasks and ensuring fair and meaningful evaluations.</description>

      <title>Shilling Recommender Systems by Generating Side-feature-aware Fake User Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17918v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) greatly influence users' consumption decisions, making them attractive targets for malicious shilling attacks that inject fake user profiles to manipulate recommendations. Existing shilling methods can generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Multimodal Fusion for User Interest Modeling in Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems improve recommendation performance by integrating multimodal representations from pre-trained models into ID-based Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction frameworks. However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Quality Assurance of Patent Specifications: A Multi-Dimensional LLM Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although AI drafting tools have gained prominence in patent writing, the systematic evaluation of AI-generated patent content quality represents a significant research gap. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module. The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80 human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent drafting tools. Evaluation is performed on 10,841 total sentences, 8,924 non-template sentences, and 554 patent figures for the three detection modules respectively, achieving balanced accuracies of 99.74%, 82.12%, and 91.2% against expert annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect distributions across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources. Section-based analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical detail precision require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction show more claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references.</description>

      <title>MMQ-v2: Align, Denoise, and Amplify: Adaptive Behavior Mining for Semantic IDs Learning in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs). However, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large, dynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data. Content-based Semantic IDs (SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However, by ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have limited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral information but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform content features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse, creating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and long-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise Corruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative noise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to the loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The equal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of different behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to distinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we propose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align, Denoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior modalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this framework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive behavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield representations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical signals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public and large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant superiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>Unstructured Evidence Attribution for Long Context Query Focused Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating coherent summaries from very long contexts given a user query, and extracting and citing evidence spans helps improve the trustworthiness of these summaries. Whereas previous work has focused on evidence citation with fixed levels of granularity (e.g. sentence, paragraph, document, etc.), we propose to extract unstructured (i.e., spans of any length) evidence in order to acquire more relevant and consistent evidence than in the fixed granularity case. We show how existing systems struggle to copy and properly cite unstructured evidence, which also tends to be "lost-in-the-middle". To help models perform this task, we create the Summaries with Unstructured Evidence Text dataset (SUnsET), a synthetic dataset generated using a novel pipeline, which can be used as training supervision for unstructured evidence summarization. We demonstrate across 5 LLMs and 4 datasets spanning human written, synthetic, single, and multi-document settings that LLMs adapted with SUnsET generate more relevant and factually consistent evidence with their summaries, extract evidence from more diverse locations in their context, and can generate more relevant and consistent summaries than baselines with no fine-tuning and fixed granularity evidence. We release SUnsET and our generation code to the public.</description>

      <title>The RAG Paradox: A Black-Box Attack Exploiting Unintentional Vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, various attack methods have been proposed to degrade their performance. However, most existing approaches rely on unrealistic assumptions in which external attackers have access to internal components such as the retriever. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack based on the RAG paradox, a structural vulnerability arising from the system's effort to enhance trust by revealing both the retrieved documents and their sources to users. This transparency enables attackers to observe which sources are used and how information is phrased, allowing them to craft poisoned documents that are more likely to be retrieved and upload them to the identified sources. Moreover, as RAG systems directly provide retrieved content to users, these documents must not only be retrievable but also appear natural and credible to maintain user confidence in the search results. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on improving document retrievability, our attack method explicitly considers both retrievability and user trust in the retrieved content. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method significantly degrades system performance without internal access, while generating natural-looking poisoned documents.</description>

      <title>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Unicode's Unseen Underpinnings in Undermining Authorship Attribution</title>

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence -- using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself. Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode steganography.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04226v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly OVD Adaptation with FLAME: Few-shot Localization via Active Marginal-Samples Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections. To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks, establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting foundation models to specific user needs.</description>

      <title>Model-Document Protocol for AI Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.</description>
