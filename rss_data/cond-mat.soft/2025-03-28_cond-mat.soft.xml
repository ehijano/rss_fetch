      <title>Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.</description>

      <title>A computational study of nematic core structure and disclination interactions in elastically anisotropic nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A singular potential method in the Q tensor order parameter representation of a nematic liquid crystal is used to study the equilibrium configuration of a disclination dipole. Unlike the well studied isotropic limit (the so called one constant approximation), we focus on the case of anisotropic Frank elasticity (bend/splay elastic constant contrast). Prior research has established that the singular potential method provides an accurate description of the tensor order parameter profile in the vicinity of a disclination core of a highly anisotropic lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal. This research is extended here to two interacting disclinations forming a dipole configuration. The director angle is shown to decay in the far field inversely with distance to the dipole as is the case in the isotropic limit, but with a different angular dependence. Therefore elastic constant anisotropy modifies the elastic screening between disclinations, with implications for the study of ensembles of defects as seen, for example, in active matter in the extended system limit.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality-enabled inverse design of Dirac-type and higher-order degeneracies for traveling and evanescent waves in phononic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose complete tailoring procedures with analytical precision for band degeneracies in one-dimensional (1D) nonlocal phononic crystals, focusing on the role of beyond-nearest-neighbor (BNN) interactions. Unlike trivial Dirac cones at either the center or boundary of Brillouin zone (BZ), we demonstrate non-trivial Dirac-type and higher-order band crossings at any desirable wave number within the BZ by tuning BNN interactions. Our analyses show that odd-indexed BNN interactions determine the quantity and wave number of degeneracy points, while even-indexed BNN interactions primarily affect the frequency. Moreover, we discover new evanescent wave modes and associated degeneracies in the complex-valued wave number. In addition, we study a varieties of spatial-temporal response patterns in time-domain simulations for the interplay between traveling and localized modes at the propagating and evanescent degeneracies.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for investigating the role of stiffness heterogeneity in structure and dynamics of flexible polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heteropolymers are ubiquitous in both synthetic systems, such as block copolymers, and biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, stiffness heterogeneity arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this letter, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool to describe biopolymer dynamic, to incorporate spatially varying stiffness. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise stiffness profiles. We find that stiffness heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables such as mean squared displacement while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform to interpret stiffness heterogeneity from experimental data especially for biopolymers as well as to design heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Effects of Stirring Time on Formation of Microplastics Fragmented from Photo-aged Polypropylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of microplastic (MP) size distributions fragmented from photo-aged polypropylene (PP) in stirred water. PP specimens fragmented into MPs with their size of 1-30 um after UV irradiation and stirring in laboratory settings. MPs were dispersed into the water during the stirring process. A series of MP size distributions was analyzed from optical microscope images of obtained MPs. The MP size distribution was described by an exponential function in the short stirring time domain, whereas it changed to a power-law function as the stirring time increased. The fragmentation rate of MPs and nanoplastics (NPs) decreased with increasing stirring time. The obtained MP exhibited higher crystallinity than the photo-aged PP specimen after stirring. This result implies that MP fragmentation is induced by the chemi-crystallization of PP.</description>

      <title>Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a notoriously complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies as well as the complex and periodically changing shapes of these meso-organisms add extra challenges for accurately modelling their dynamics. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to experimentally study the physics of biological meso-swimming dynamics. We directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia sp. and determine how the propulsive force scales with body size. We show that this scaling law is universal for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms, regardless of body shape, swimming strategy, or the addition of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we determine the time-reversal symmetry breaking of Artemia as it transitions from the viscous regime to the mesoscale. We discover that this model meso-swimmer achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.</description>

      <title>Odd Droplets: Fluids with Odd Viscosity and Highly Deformable Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flows with deformable interfaces are commonly controlled by applying an external field or modifying the boundaries that interact with the fluid, but realizing such solutions can be demanding or impractical in various scenarios. Here, we demonstrate that fluids with broken symmetries can self-control their mechanics. We present a continuum model of a viscous fluid with highly deformable interfaces subject to capillary stresses. Our model features odd viscosity, a parity-violating property that emerges in chiral fluids. Using direct numerical simulations, we focus on the impact of an odd droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. We demonstrate that odd viscosity dramatically disrupts conventional symmetric spreading by inducing asymmetric deformations and chiral flow patterns. Our analysis reveals a variety of dynamic regimes, including leftward and rightward bouncing, as well as rolling, depending on the relative strength of the odd viscosity. Our work illustrates that regulating odd viscosity provides a promising framework for controlling multiphase flows and designing functional metamaterials with tailored fluidic properties.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to fluctuation theorems: from theory to experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics is a fundamental branch of physics, and over the years, it has evolved to include mesoscopic and out-of-equilibrium systems driven by theoretical and experimental advances at the micro- and nanoscale. This development has led to \textit{stochastic thermodynamics}, a framework that connects microscopic fluctuations with macroscopic laws. Despite their significance, fundamental ideas, such as fluctuation theorems, are frequently not covered in current curricula, leaving them largely unknown across many disciplines. Here, we present the core results of stochastic thermodynamics, particularly the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks theorem, using an integrated approach combining theoretical foundations with experimental verification using optical tweezers. This approach helps to clarify the fundamentals, linking theoretical ideas to real elements in the lab, showing the simplicity of the apparatus, and presenting detailed procedures for calibration and calculation of relevant quantities to enable the implementation of these experiments in new research and teaching laboratories. The goal is to enrich thermodynamics education and to stimulate exploration in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Computer simulations of the bacterial ribosome using a general purpose coarse-grained model MARTINI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ribosomes are critical biomolecular nanomachines responsible for protein synthesis in all known organisms. The function and dynamics of ribosomes can be studied using molecular dynamics computer simulations. Although this task remains challenging at atomic level, several studies have reported all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire ribosome. However, for certain applications, atomistic simulations are impractical due to the limited simulation timescales achievable. In this study, we investigate the applicability of the coarse-grained MARTINI model for simulations of the bacterial ribosome. After testing several simulation setups, we found that the structure of the ribosome and its components are generally well represented compared to the reference experimental structure. Compared with all-atom simulations of the entire ribosome, coarse-grained simulations result in a less flexible and smaller ribosome. We demonstrate how modifications of some parameters of the model can enhance the dynamics of the ribosome to better align with the atomistic model. Our work provides a detailed protocol for coarse-grained simulations of the ribosome and highlights aspects of the model that need improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid crystals consisting of biaxial particles can exhibit a much richer phase behavior than their uniaxial counterparts. Usually, one has to rely on simulation results to understand the phase diagram of these systems, since very few analytical results exist. In this work, we apply fundamental measure theory, which allows us to derive free energy functionals for hard particles from first principles and with high accuracy, to systems of hard cylinders, cones and spherotriangles. We provide a general recipe for incorporating biaxial liquid crystal order parameters into fundamental measure theory and use this framework to obtain the phase boundaries for the emergence of orientational order in the considered systems. Our results provide insights into the phase behavior of biaxial nematic liquid crystals and, in particular, into methods for their analytical investigation.</description>

Abstract: The complexation of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoresponsive microgels is widely exploited for applications, but a microscopic description of the mechanisms governing the spatial organization of the NPs is still lacking. Combining small angle X-ray scattering, state-of-the-art simulations and a simple toy model, we uncover how the volume phase transition of microgels controls NP-NP interactions, establishing for the first time a microscopic link between plasmon coupling and NP local structure. Our study paves the way to experimentally investigate phase transitions on controlled curved surfaces at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05851v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively search a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this manuscript, we raise the question of the optimal timing for launching multiple agents in a search in order to reach the best compromise between minimizing the overall search time and minimizing the costs associated with launching and sustaining agents. After introducing a general formalism for independent agents in which we allow them to be launched at arbitrary times, we investigate by means of analytical calculations and numerical optimization the optimal launch strategies to optimize the quantiles of the search cost and its mean. Finally, we compare our results with the case of stochastic resetting and study the conditions under which it is preferable to launch new searchers rather than resetting the first one to its initial position.</description>
