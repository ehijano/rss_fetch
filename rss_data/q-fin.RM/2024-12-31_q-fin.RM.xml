      <title>A Dynamic Spillover Effect Investigation on Cryptocurrency Market Before and After Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper distinguishes between risk resonance and risk diversification relationships in the cryptocurrency market based on the newly developed asymmetric breakpoint approach, and analyzes the risk propagation mechanism among cryptocurrencies under extreme events. In addition, through the lens of node association and network structure, this paper explores the dynamic evolutionary relationship of cryptocurrency risk association before and after the epidemic. In addition, the driving mechanism of the cryptocurrency risk movement is analyzed in a depth with the epidemic indicators. The findings show that the effect of propagation of risk among cryptocurrencies becomes more significant under the influence of the new crown outbreak. At the same time, the increase in the number of confirmed cases exacerbated the risk spillover effect among cryptocurrencies, while the risk resonance effect that exists between the crude oil market and the cryptocurrency market amplified the extent of the outbreak's impact on cryptocurrencies. However, other financial markets are relatively independent of the cryptocurrency market. This study proposes a strategy to deal with the spread of cryptocurrency risks from the perspective of a public health crisis, providing a useful reference basis for improving the regulatory mechanism of cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <title>Machine and Deep Learning for Credit Scoring: A compliant approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit Scoring is one of the problems banks and financial institutions have to solve on a daily basis. If the state-of-the-art research in Machine and Deep Learning for finance has reached interesting results about Credit Scoring models, usage of such models in a heavily regulated context such as the one in banks has never been done so far.
  Our work is thus a tentative to challenge the current regulatory status-quo and introduce new BASEL 2 and 3 compliant techniques, while still answering the Federal Reserve Bank and the European Central Bank requirements.
  With the help of Gradient Boosting Machines (mainly XGBoost) we challenge an actual model used by BANK A for scoring through the door Auto Loan applicants. We prove that the usage of such algorithms for Credit Scoring models drastically improves performance and default capture rate.
  Furthermore, we leverage the power of Shapley Values to prove that these relatively simple models are not as black-box as the current regulatory system thinks they are, and we attempt to explain the model outputs and Credit Scores within the BANK A Model Design and Validation framework</description>

      <title>Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11773v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is the first to explore the performance of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&amp;P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, indicating that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR forecasting.</description>
