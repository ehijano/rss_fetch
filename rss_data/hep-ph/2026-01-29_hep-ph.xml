      <title>Next-to-Leading Order Running in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-to-leading order (NLO) Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) renormalization group equations are needed to account for phenomenologically relevant operator mixing and ensure renormalization scale independence in NLO calculations of observables. For the first time, we present the renormalization group equations of the baryon-number-conserving sector of the dimension-six SMEFT up to two-loop order. Our calculations have been performed using functional methods with an anticommuting $ \gamma_5 $-scheme. A variety of strategies are employed to mitigate the reading-point ambiguities inherent to this scheme choice. We also describe how a local version of the $ \boldsymbol{R}^\ast $-method is adapted to handle the evanescent operators arising in dimensional regularization. The results are provided in various supplementary files to make them accessible for both human inspection and numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>FORM Version 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FORM 5, a major release of the symbolic-manipulation system FORM. Version 5 introduces an integrated diagram generator, based on the GRACE graph-generator, to produce Feynman diagrams directly from FORM scripts. This release also adds support for arbitrary precision floating point coefficients, together with statements for the numerical evaluation of common mathematical functions as well as multiple zeta values and Euler sums. In addition, FORM 5 provides an interface to the FLINT library, offering substantially faster polynomial arithmetic. Various further functions and commands have been added alongside these major features, as well as performance improvements for TFORM and improved compression of FORM's temporary files. Compatibility with the previous release, FORM 4.3.1, is retained except where prior behaviour contradicted the manual or was experimental.</description>

      <title>Fully differential Higgs boson pair production at N$^3$LO with top quark mass effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgs-boson pair production is of fundamental importance for probing the Higgs potential. At hadron colliders, the dominant production channel proceeds via gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) mediated by a top-quark loop. We report the first fully differential predictions for Higgs-boson pair production through ggF at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ in the heavy-top-quark limit (HTL). Fiducial cross section and selected differential distributions are presented at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, under realistic experimental selection cuts. The N$^3$LO QCD corrections reduce the scale uncertainties of the next-to-next-to-leading order fiducial and differential predictions by approximately a factor of three, bringing the theoretical uncertainty to the percent level in the HTL. After incorporating top-quark-mass effects at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$, we provide one of the most precise parton-level differential predictions to date for ongoing experimental searches for Higgs-boson pair production at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Parton Fragmentation Functions Extracted with a Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable predictions of many high-energy strong interaction processes rely heavily on the non-perturbative parton fragmentation functions (FFs) extracted from existing experimental data. Conventional methods often require parameterized forms of FFs and additional scale evolution according to the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations. We introduce a novel approach to determining parton FFs using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). Unlike traditional methods, our approach does not require prior parameterized forms and directly integrates the DGLAP evolution equations into the neural network architecture, allowing the FFs to automatically satisfy these equations. We present new sets of parton FFs extracted from hadron spectra in electron-positron annihilation processes at next-to-leading order (NLO) in pQCD using this new technique. To validate our approach, we calculate charged hadron spectra in proton-(anti)proton collisions using the extracted FFs and demonstrate that the results align well with experimental data across a large range of colliding energies ($\sqrt{s}$ = 130, 200, 500, 630, 900, 1800, 2760, 5020, 5440, 7000 GeV). Our findings indicate that the PINN method not only simplifies the extraction process but also enhances the universal applicability of FFs across different energy scales. By eliminating the need for parameterized forms and additional DGLAP evolution, our approach represents a significant step forward toward fast and accurate extractions of non-perturbative quantities such as parton fragmentations functions and parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Dark matter motivated sterile neutrino contribution to neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact seesaw relation in a type-I seesaw framework puts constraints on the relations between active and sterile neutrino sectors in terms of their masses and mixing angles. In such a setup, we employ a model-independent approach to investigate the signature of sterile neutrinos in the half-life of the neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay process. In particular, we aim to study the contribution of sterile neutrinos in the mass range $\sim$~keV that is motivated by the dark matter constituent of the Universe. Further, the masses of the sterile neutrinos are determined by the active neutrino masses, mixing angles, and phases, and active-sterile mixing angles and $CP$-violating phases. The parameter space is constrained by the exact seesaw relation, thereby making the analysis constrained. After capturing the parameter space that can account for $\sim~$keV scale masses for the sterile neutrinos, we adopt the chiral effective field theory approach to calculate the half-life and effective mass in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. As the study transitions from the TeV scale to scenarios involving at least one sterile neutrino in the keV mass range, it reveals a significant modification of the effective mass. In particular, the cancellation region associated with the normal mass hierarchy for TeV-scale sterile neutrinos no longer persists when a keV-scale sterile neutrino is introduced, resulting in a finite effective mass that future experiments can probe. Likewise, the involvement of keV-scale sterile neutrino in the inverted mass hierarchy case makes the band distorted and scattered points appear around the main band.</description>

      <title>Probing torsion field with Einstein-Cartan gravity at the HL-LHC: an angular distribution case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This analysis utilizes simulated data privately generated based on the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) configuration to investigate the angular distribution of high-mass dimuon pairs produced during the foreseen proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. The study focuses on the cos$\theta_{CS}$ variable, which is defined in the Collins-Soper frame. In the Standard Model, the production of high-mass dimuon pairs is primarily governed by the Drell-Yan process, which demonstrates a significant forward-backward asymmetry. However, scenarios beyond the Standard Model suggest different shapes for the cos$\theta_{CS}$ distribution. By observing excess events not predicted by the Standard Model, the angular distribution can help differentiate among these alternative models. Furthermore, we used a simplified Einstein-Cartan gravity model to analyze the simulated data. This analysis established upper limits at the 95\% confidence level regarding the masses of various particles within the model, including a spin-2 dark neutral gauge boson and the torsion field.</description>

      <title>Bjorken Initial Energy Density and Viscous Longitudinal Hydrodynamic Evolution in Xe-Xe Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the Bjorken initial energy density in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV, estimated using charged-particle multiplicity data and a generalized transverse overlap geometry applicable beyond the most central collisions. The dependence of the extracted energy density is examined by adopting both a constant formation time and a centrality-dependent formation time derived from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Corresponding Bjorken energy density estimates for Pb-Pb collisions are also presented for comparison. Taking the Bjorken energy density and formation time as initial conditions, the subsequent longitudinal evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in these collisions is studied. Both ideal and first-order viscous boost-invariant hydrodynamics are employed to assess the influence of dissipation. We observe that viscous effects slow the longitudinal expansion and lead to entropy production dominated by early-time dynamics. The lifetime of the QGP is observed to increase with centrality and is substantially enhanced by viscous effects. These effects are highly sensitive to the choice of formation time, particularly in peripheral collisions. A comparative analysis of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions demonstrates that the longitudinal evolution is primarily controlled by the initial energy density scale set by the Bjorken prescription. Consequently, when this scale is comparable, both systems exhibit nearly identical evolution patterns, while appreciable distinctions emerge in peripheral collisions due to system-size and geometric effects.</description>

      <title>Searching for a $P_{cs}(4200)$ state in the $\Lambda_b\to\phi\eta_c\Lambda$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the $\Lambda_b\to\phi \eta_c \Lambda$ reaction to observe a $P_{cs}$ state around $4200$ MeV, predicted at lower masses than expected from comparison with the $P_c$ states, stemming as a consequence of the important role played by coupled channels in the $P_{cs}$ case, which does not appear in the $P_c$ case. That state decays to $\eta_c \Lambda$ with a width of about $200$ keV. The reaction is related to $\Lambda_b^0\to\phi D_s^- \Lambda_c^+$, which has already been observed. We predict a branching fraction for $\Lambda_b\to\phi P_{cs}(4200)$; $P_{cs}\to\eta_c \Lambda$ of the order of $10^{-5}$, which is within present capabilities of the LHCb collaboration. The observation of this state would bring valuable light on the nature of the $P_c$ and $P_{cs}$ states and the role played by coupled channels in hadron structure and hadron reactions.</description>

      <title>Photon emission due to vacuum instability under the action of a quasi-constant electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a nonperturbative formulation of strong-field QED developed in our earlier works, we consider photon emission accompanying vacuum instability under the action of a quasi-constant strong electric field of finite duration T. We construct closed formulas for the total probabilities and study the photon emission accompanying an electron-positron pair creation from a vacuum. We establish the domain of the applicability of the locally constant field approximation (LCFA) for the photon emission. We study angular and polarization distribution of the emission as well as emission characteristics in a high-frequency approximations with respect of 1/T. The results presented in this work is suitable to a further development of the LCFA proposed in [Phys. Rev. D 95, 076013 (2017)].</description>

      <title>Decoding $Z_c(4430)$ and $Z_c(4200)$: The role of $P$-wave charmed mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic investigation of the hidden-charm tetraquark states with $I^G(J^{PC})=1^+(1^{+-})$ within the hadronic molecular picture, placing particular emphasis on systems composed of an $S$-wave $(D, D^*)$ meson and a $P$-wave $(D_0^*(2300), D_1(2430), D_1(2420), D_2^*(2460))$ meson. Adopting the One-Boson Exchange potential, we solve the Schr\"odinger equation in momentum space via the Complex Scaling Method. A crucial feature of our approach is the rigorous treatment of the unstable nature of the $P$-wave constituents by incorporating three-body decay effects arising from self-energy corrections and the static limit approximation. Our results demonstrate that these three-body dynamics play a crucial role in determining the pole positions, specifically in reproducing the large decay widths observed experimentally. We identify several broad resonances in the $D^*\bar{D}_1(2420)$ and $D^*\bar{D}_2^*(2460)$ systems as candidates for the $Z_c(4430)$, while the significantly broader resonances in the $D\bar{D}_0^*(2300)$ and $D\bar{D}_1(2430)$ sectors are suggested as candidates for the $Z_c(4200)$. Focusing on the $D^*\bar{D}_2^*(2460)$ assignment as a specific case study, we further analyze the line shape of the $Z_c(4430)$ candidate using a Flatt\'e-like parametrization with energy-dependent self-energy terms, providing predictions for its open-charm decay modes to guide future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Graviton energy spectra arising from the KSVZ axion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion, the goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, provides a dynamical solution to the strong CP problem and is an excellent dark matter candidate. Various experiments are designed to search for the axion, however no confirmative signal has been observed. On the other hand, there are also hypothetical heavy particles in axion models, such as the heavy scalar $s$, which is the CP-even component of the complex scalar that carries $U(1)_{PQ}$ charge, and the vector-like heavy quark (VLQ) in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov~(KSVZ) axion model. Studying signals induced by them are helpful for axion searches. In this paper, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung energy spectrum arising from the decay of the heavy scalar or VLQ in the KSVZ model. The result shows that these heavy particles can emit ultrahigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), with the peak frequency depending on the model's parameter inputs. In addition, the graviton spectrum is distinguished from the thermal GW background at high frequencies if there is an early matter-dominated era induced by these heavy particles. Future measurements of ultrahigh-frequency GWs may provide indirect evidence for the KSVZ axion.</description>

      <title>The strangest non-strange meson is not so strange: Phase shift analysis reveals the geometric origin of the $f_0(500)$ residue phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $f_0(500)$ meson is often labeled a "non-Breit-Wigner" resonance due to the large background phase required for its description. By fitting elastic phase shifts of the $f_0(500)$, $\rho(770)$, and $\Delta(1232)$, we extract the effective background phase $\phi_\mathrm{B}$ and uncover an empirical regularity within our formalism: $\phi_\mathrm{B}$ is equal to the angle subtended by the pole and the threshold $\phi_0$. This implies the residue phase is geometrically constrained to be $\theta \approx 2\phi_0$. The anomalous nature of the $f_0(500)$ thus arises from the proximity of its pole to the $\pi\pi$ threshold. A unified scaling relation confirms the $f_0(500)$ behaves as a standard Breit-Wigner resonance.</description>

      <title>Investigation on the photoproduction of bottom-charmed baryon within NRQCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a further theoretical study of the orbital $P$-wave bottom-charmed baryon within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD), considering both the direct photoproduction channel $\gamma+\gamma \rightarrow \Xi_{bc} +\bar{c}+\bar{b}$ and the resolved photoproduction channel $\gamma+g \rightarrow \Xi_{bc} +\bar{c}+\bar{b}$. At future linear colliders, ILC and CLIC, the initial photons can be emitted from the laser back-scattering (LBS) and then the parton gluon can be emitted from the photon. The formation of $\Xi_{bc}$ can be modeled in two-step: a compact diquark state $\langle bc\rangle[n]$ is formed first and subsequently captures a light quark from the vacuum to hadronize into the baryon $\Xi_{bc}$. The color and spin quantum number $[n]$ of $\langle bc\rangle$-diquark can be $[{}^3S_1]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}/\textbf{6}}$, $[{}^1S_0]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}/\textbf{6}}$, $[{}^1P_1]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}/\textbf{6}}$ or $[{}^3P_J]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}/\textbf{6}}$ with $J=0,1,2$. Based on the collision energies and design luminosity of ILC and CLIC, the cross sections, the differential distributions and the estimated produced events of $\Xi_{bc}$ baryon have been analyzed. The results show that the contribution of the orbital excited $P$-wave $\Xi_{bc}$ baryon can reach 7%-9% of the $S$-wave, providing a non-negligible contributions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the properties of the Hadronic Phase in Heavy-Ion Collisions at RHIC Energies via Partial Chemical Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions plays a crucial role in shaping the final-state hadron abundances. In this work, we study Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7-200 GeV using the Hadron Resonance Gas model in Partial Chemical Equilibrium (HRG-PCE). By fitting the yields of stable hadrons and short-lived resonances such as K$^*(892)^0$, we extract both chemical and kinetic freeze-out temperatures as functions of center-of-mass energy and centrality. The analysis, performed using the Thermal-FIST package, avoids assumptions about radial flow profile or freeze-out hypersurfaces. Furthermore, we estimate the baryon annihilation freeze-out temperature from the experimentally measured $\bar{\rm p}/$p ratio, using the HRG-PCE framework extended to include $B\bar{B} \leftrightarrow n\pi$ reactions. The inferred annihilation freeze-out temperature lies between the chemical and kinetic freeze-out temperatures, suggesting that baryon annihilation remains active in the early hadronic phase but ceases prior to kinetic freeze-out. These results provide a consistent picture of the sequential decoupling of hadronic processes and demonstrate that inelastic hadronic interactions significantly influence the chemical composition of the system between chemical and kinetic freeze-outs at RHIC energies.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Scale-dependent Dark Matter Profile and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we use the recently introduced concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, and we provide an analytic model of dark matter that can produce viable rotation curves even for low-surface-brightness galaxies, irregular galaxies, low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies, all known to challenge the cold dark matter description. The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $\rho(r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\frac{K_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.</description>

      <title>Baryon Transition Form Factors from Dynamical Coupled-Channel Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk, the electromagnetic transition form factors from the nucleon ground state to twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ states are exhibited and discussed. Those results are extracted through a comprehensive coupled-channel approach -- the Juelich-Bonn-Washington model, with the center-of-mass energy ranging from $1.13$ GeV to $1.8$ GeV, and the photon virtuality up to $8$ GeV$^2$. The extraction is based on $10^5$ electroproduction data points of $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ channels, with additionally about $5\times 10^4$ data points in the hadronic sector as well as photoproductions as boundary conditions. The form factors are defined from the residues at the corresponding resonance poles in the multipole amplitudes. Uncertainties are also estimated by the exploration of the parameter space. The qualitative behavior of the transition form factors of $N(1440)$ and $\Delta(1232)$ here are in agreement with the previous studies, while for the other states, there has not been literature results that are also defined at the resonance poles.</description>

      <title>Gluon knots as the dynamical core of baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a conjectural picture of baryon structure in which gluon knots, a type of topologically nontrivial configuration of color--magnetic monopole condensates, forms the dynamical core of the baryon. Within this framework, quarks interact with the gluon knot via abelian-dominated color-electric fields, which are squeezed into flux tubes by the dual Meissner effect, leading naturally to quark confinement. The color--magnetic fields associated with the gluon knot also induce a local chiral condensate, contributing to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the baryon mass. Extending this conjecture to heavy-flavor mesons, we argue that stable flux tubes and gluon knots may also play a role in their internal structure, whereas light-flavor mesons are dominated by alternative confinement mechanisms. Our approach provides a unified, topologically motivated picture linking confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the internal dynamics of baryons and certain mesons, suggesting that gluon knots constitute fundamental infrared degrees of freedom of Yang--Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition at weak coupling in two-color matrix QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the matrix model of two-color one-flavor adjoint QCD (matrix-QCD$_{2,1}^{\text{adj}}$) in the weak coupling regime (small $g$) and in the chiral limit. The Yang-Mills potential has two distinct gauge invariant minima: one at $A_i=0$ and the other at $A_i = \frac{\sigma_i}{2g}$. We show that when the chiral chemical potential $c \leq \frac{3}{2}$, there is a quantum phase transition at $g_0^\ast \simeq 0.143$: for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state wavefunction is localized near $A_i=0$, while for $g&gt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state is delocalized over the gauge configuration space. The transition between these two phases is singular, with the ground state at $g_0^\ast$ being distinctly different from that of $g_0^\ast \pm|\epsilon|$. At $g_0^\ast$, we show that the square of the chromoelectric field vanishes, strongly suggesting that the system is in a ``dual superconductor" phase. Numerical evidence shows that the localization-delocalization phenomenon holds for the 1st and 2nd excited states as well, leading us to conjecture that there are an infinite number of isolated singular points $g_0^\ast&gt; g_1^\ast&gt;g_2^\ast&gt; \cdots$ accumulating to $g=0$. For $c=1$, the model formally possesses $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. We show that in the localized phase (i.e. for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$) the supermultiplet structure is disrupted and SUSY is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <title>A scalable flow-based approach to mitigate topological freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As lattice gauge theories with non-trivial topological features are driven towards the continuum limit, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suffer for topological freezing, i.e., a dramatic growth of autocorrelations in topological observables. A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Copositive criteria for a two-component dark matter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-component scalar dark matter model in this work, where the scalars are stabilized by extra $Z_2 \times Z'_2$ symmetry. To guarantee the stability of the vacuum, we consider the copositive criteria and different choices of the signs of the couplings will contribute to different viable parameter spaces. Based on the copositive criteria, we systematically analyze the possible conditions and pick up 17 different cases with fixing some parameters to be negative. We randomly scan the parameter space under dark matter relic density constraint and direct detection constraint and focus on the quartic couplings with $\lambda_{13}$,$\lambda_{23}$,$\lambda_{14}$ and $\lambda_{24}$. The shapes of the viable parameter space for $|\lambda_{14}|-|\lambda_{24}|$ are almost similar among these cases, while for $|\lambda_{13}|$ and $|\lambda_{23}|$, the larger value are excluded as long as $\lambda_{13}\leqslant 0$ and $\lambda_{23}\leqslant 0$ due to the large interference effect of the $2 \to 2$ processes.</description>

      <title>Discovery Prospects for a Minimal Dark Matter Model at Cosmic and Intensity Frontier Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the detection prospects for a minimal secluded dark matter model, where a fermionic dark matter particle interacts with the Standard Model (SM) via a kinetically mixed dark photon. We focus on scenarios where the dark photon decays visibly, making it a prime target for beam-dump experiments. In this model, the dark matter relic abundance can be achieved by a variety of mechanisms: freeze-in, out-of-equilibrium freeze-out, and secluded freeze-out. We demonstrate that the secluded freeze-out regime in the considered mass range is now entirely excluded by a combination of direct and indirect detection constraints. Moreover, we show that future direct detection and intensity frontier experiments offer complementary sensitivity to this minimal model in the parameter space where the hidden sector never enters equilibrium with the SM. In out-of-equilibrium freeze-out scenarios, nuclear-recoil direct detection experiments can still access signals above the neutrino fog that are mediated by dark photons that are too weakly coupled to be detected in future beam dump experiments. Meanwhile, future beam dump experiments provide a powerful probe of the freeze-in parameter space in this model, which is largely inaccessible to direct detection experiments. Notably, even in the absence of a future observation in direct detection experiments, a dark photon discovery remains possible at SHiP, DUNE, LHCb, and DarkQuest within this minimal dark matter model.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Uncertainty Principle. New Bounds and Trends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is one of the fundamental pillars of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. It is normally introduced by postulating the commutation relations $[\hat{x}^i, \hat{p}^j] = i\hbar \delta^{ij}$. However, as suggested by some quantum gravity models and string theory, this basic principle no longer holds true in the presence of a minimal length, possible the Plank length, and modifications of the commutation have been proposed i.e., of the form $[\hat{x}^\mu, \hat{p}^\nu ] = -i\hbar(1 + \beta_0 \, \hat{p}^2/\Lambda^2 )\eta^{\mu\nu}$(plus possible additional terms). In this work we will consider the previous modified uncertainty principle in terms of an effective field theory, comment upon some theoretical subtleties that are often overlooked in the literature, and constrain, for the first time, the $\Lambda$ scale with the Compton high-energy experimental data. Our findings suggest that high-energy experiments are potentially sensitive to these corrections and could serve as an effective framework for probing possible violations of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MORRIS (Magnetic Oscillatory Resonator for Rare-Interaction Studies) and propose the first tabletop search for non-Newtonian gravity due to a Yukawa-like fifth force using a magnetically levitated particle. Our experiment comprises a levitated sub-millimeter magnet in a superconducting trap that is driven by a time-periodic source. Featuring short-, medium-, and long-term stages, MORRIS will admit increasing sensitivities to the force coupling strength $\alpha$, optimally probing screening lengths of $\lambda \sim 1\,\mathrm{mm}$. Our short-term setup provides a proof-of-principle study, with our medium- and long-term stages respectively constraining $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-5}$, leading over existing bounds. Our projections are readily recastable to concrete models predicting the existence of fifth forces, and our statistical analysis is generally applicable to well-characterized sinusoidal driving forces. By leveraging ultralow dissipation and heavy test masses, MORRIS opens a new window onto tests of small-scale gravity and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Bridging doubly heavy tetraquark mass spectrum with heavy baryons utilizing heavy antiquark-diquark symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, we present a systematic study of double heavy tetraquarks ($T_{QQ'\bar{q}\bar{q}'}$) using heavy antiquark-diquark symmetry (HADS) within a constituent quark model. By calibrating model parameters to known hadron spectra and incorporating the effective mass formula, we predict the masses for 38 ground-state tetraquarks with $cc$, $bb$, and $bc$ heavy quark pairs, including the non-strange, single-strange, and double-strange configurations with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^+, 1^+$ and $2^+$. Notably, we identify several stable states below the relevant meson-meson thresholds, particularly in the $bb\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ sector. The explicit connection between doubly heavy tetraquark and heavy baryon spectra through HADS reduces model dependence and reveals fundamental systematics in the heavy-quark hadron landscape.</description>

      <title>Scalar leptoquark contributions to the $gg\rightarrow Zh$ process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the general scalar leptoquark contributions to the $gg\rightarrow Zh$ process at one-loop level. We find that the contributions only show up for the off-diagonal Higgs and $Z$ boson interactions with scalar leptoquarks, which can lead to new tensor structures different from the standard model. In the one-field and two-field models, the contributions vanish exactly; thus, the contributions are possible at least in the three-field models. We exemplify the contributions in the $S_1+\widetilde{R}_2+S_3$ model, which can appear in the presence of scalar leptoquark mass splittings and $CP$ violation. In view of the heavy scalar leptoquark mass suppression, the leading contributions are typically small and difficult to observe at hadron colliders. However, this work offers a quantitative and systematic investigation of scalar leptoquark contributions, also making it valuable for the new physics studies in other models.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of a light fermion bound to a heavy one is expected to be described by the Dirac equation with an external potential. The potential breaks translation invariance, whereas the bound state momentum is well defined. Boosting the bound state determines the frame dependence of the light fermion dynamics. I study the Dirac limit of QCD$_2$ in the limit of $N_c \to \infty$. The light quark wave function turns out to be independent of the frame of the bound state, up to an irrelevant Lorentz contraction. The discrete bound state spectrum determines corresponding discrete energies of the Dirac equation, which for a linear potential allows a continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Study of transition form factors of the lightest pseudoscalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the transition form factors of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons, $\pi^0$, $\eta$, and $\eta'$, within the framework of resonance chiral theory. Our analysis is performed based on the data of time-like and space-like singly-virtual and space-like doubly-virtual form factors, as well as the relevant cross sections and latest invariant mass spectra of $e^+e^-$ pair for the process of $P\to\gamma e^+ e^-$. The transition form factors of these pseudoscalars are obtained. Also, we evaluate their contributions to the light-by-light part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Our two Fits give similar results, where Fit-A gives $a_\mu^{\pi^0 }=(61.6\pm 1.8)\times10^{-11}$, $a_\mu^{\eta }=(15.2\pm1.7)\times10^{-11}$, $a_\mu^{\eta'}=(16.0\pm 1.2)\times10^{-11}$, and the total contribution of neutral pseudo-scalar meson poles is $a_\mu^{\pi^0+\eta+\eta'}=(92.8\pm2.9)\times10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>R-parity violation and 8 TeV four-jet events at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has observed two four-jet events with a total invariant mass of about 8 TeV; within each event, the jets can be paired into two dijets with invariant masses of 2 TeV each. These are extremely rare events due to the large invariant mass, which implies a very small QCD background, as well as to the di-jet structure, which makes it prone to an interpretation in terms of a heavy resonance decaying into two lighter ones. We investigate the possible interpretation of these events in terms of supersymmetry with a single baryon-number and R-Parity violating term. In this particular scenario, the lighter resonances are identified with the right-handed squarks of the first generation, while the heavy one is interpreted in terms of a down-squark of the second or third generation. We discuss the constraints that shape this interpretation and outline a well-defined scenario for its realization. The resulting predictions can be scrutinized with forthcoming LHC data.</description>

      <title>Axion condensates in neutron stars and radial oscillation modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light QCD axions, introduced to solve the strong CP problem, may form condensates inside neutron stars, giving rise to a novel ground state of dense matter. We investigate how such axion condensates modify the equilibrium structure and radial oscillation spectrum of neutron stars. Using a realistic neutron star model with the BSk26 equation of state, and solving the coupled Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and Klein-Gordon equations together with a linear perturbation analysis, we find two distinct families of quasinormal modes: weakly damped fluid-dominated oscillations and highly damped axion modes. The coupling between the fluid and the axion field introduces axion-induced damping of radial oscillations, with decay timescales of order seconds for kHz axion masses. Modes with frequencies above the axion mass are strongly damped, while those below remain unaffected. Although neutron star radial oscillations are difficult to observe, our results suggest that extensions of this work can turn neutron star seismology into a novel probe of the axion properties.</description>

Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that, depending on the geometry and quark ordering, the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system may be a hadronic molecule, a tetraquark state, or a superposition of the two. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>

      <title>Neural Fake Factor Estimation Using Data-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a high-energy physics data analysis, the term "fake" backgrounds refers to events that would formally not satisfy the (signal) process selection criteria, but are accepted nonetheless due to mis-reconstructed particles. This can occur, e.g., when leptons from secondary decays are incorrectly identified as originating from the hard-scatter interaction point (known as non-prompt leptons), or when other physics objects, such as hadronic jets, are mistakenly reconstructed as leptons (resulting in mis-identified leptons). These fake leptons are usually estimated using data-driven techniques, one of the most common being the Fake Factor method. This method relies on predicting the fake lepton contribution by reweighting data events, using a scale factor (i.e. fake factor) function. Traditionally, fake factors have been estimated by histogramming and computing the ratio of two data distributions, typically as functions of a few relevant physics variables such as the transverse momentum $p_\text{T}$ and pseudorapidity $\eta$. In this work, we introduce a novel approach of fake factor calculation, based on density ratio estimation using neural networks trained directly on data in a higher-dimensional feature space. We show that our method enables the computation of a continuous, unbinned fake factor on a per event basis, offering a more flexible, precise, and higher-dimensional alternative to the conventional method, making it applicable to a wide range of analyses. A simple LHC open data analysis we implemented confirms the feasibility of the method and demonstrates that the ML-based fake factor provides smoother, more stable estimates across the phase space than traditional methods, reducing binning artifacts and improving extrapolation to signal regions.</description>

      <title>Hidden self-energy contributions of collinear functions in SCET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the requirement of the LSZ reduction formula to remove self-energy contributions on external legs, we examine quark self-energy contributions in soft-collinear effective (SCET) theory. We examine an operator basis that follows directly from full quantum chromodynamics (QCD) (upon application of the SCET equations of motion to express small Dirac components in terms of large Dirac components). We find that, for this basis, the self-energy contributions can be identified from their diagrammatic topologies, as in full QCD. However, for an alternative operator basis that is obtained from the direct-QCD basis by an application of Wilson-line identities, interactions are shifted from a covariant derivative to a Wilson line. Consequently, some self-energy contributions are hidden in diagrams involving Wilson lines, making their identification subtle.</description>

      <title>The nonleptonic decays of double-charmed baryon $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$ within the nonrelativistic quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the two-body nonleptonic decays of double-charmed baryon $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$ within a nonrelativistic quark model, in which the nonfactorizable amplitudes contributed by $W$-exchange diagrams are evaluated under pole model assumption. To reduce sensitivity of decay amplitudes to arbitrary choice of baryon wave functions, we adopted charmed baryon wave functions obtained by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a nonrelativistic quark potential model. Our results show that the branching fractions of CF decays $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\to\Omega_{c}^{0}\pi^{+}$ and $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime)+}\pi^{+}$, as well as the SCS decays $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\to\Omega_{c}^{0}K^{+}$, $\Sigma_{cc}^{++}K^{-}$, $\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\eta$ and $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\bar{K}^{0}$ can reach up to a few percents. Particularly for the $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\to\Omega_{c}^{0}K^{+}$ mode, owing to the large factorizable amplitude and constructive pole contributions, the branching fraction is comparable to CF decays. These decay modes can serve as the discovery channels for the double-charmed baryon $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$ in future experiments like LHCb and Belle II.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Resonant Type-I and Type-II Leptogenesis in SO(10) with Quasi-Degenerate Triplet and Right-Handed Neutrino Masses $M_T \simeq M_{N_3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe remains one of the central open problems in particle physics and cosmology. We identify a regime of \emph{hybrid resonant leptogenesis} in renormalizable SO(10) grand unified theories, where a quasi-degeneracy between the scalar triplet and the heaviest right-handed neutrino, \( M_T \simeq M_{N_3}, \) naturally arises from their common origin in unified scalar multiplets and leads to an enhanced interference between type-I and type-II decay amplitudes. This interference gives rise to a physical CP-violating phase, \( \phi_{\rm HR} = \arg(\mu f Y_\nu^\dagger), \) which cannot be removed by field redefinitions and induces a resonant enhancement of the baryon asymmetry without requiring extreme Yukawa hierarchies or fine-tuned mass splittings. We show that the observed asymmetry, \( Y_B \simeq 8.7 \times 10^{-11}, \) can be reproduced for mass scales around \(10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}\), moderate washout effects, and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ CP-violating phases. The mechanism leads to correlated low-energy signatures in lepton-flavour violation and electric dipole moments, providing potential experimental tests.</description>

Abstract: Modern machine learning is transforming jet tagging at the LHC, but the leading transformer architectures are large, not particularly fast, and training-intensive. We present a slim version of the L-GATr tagger, reduce the number of parameters of jet-tagging transformers, and quantize them. We compare different quantization methods for standard and Lorentz-equivariant transformers and estimate their gains in resource efficiency. We find an order-of-magnitude reduction in energy cost for an moderate performance decrease, down to 1000-parameter taggers. This might be a step towards trigger-level jet tagging with small and quantized versions of the leading equivariant transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Formation of trapped vacuum bubbles during inflation, and consequences for PBH scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of inflationary scenarios for primordial black hole (PBH) formation include a small barrier in the slope of the potential. There, the inflaton slows down, generating an enhancement of primordial perturbations. Moreover, the background solution overcomes the barrier at a very low speed, and large backward quantum fluctuations can prevent certain regions from overshooting the barrier. This leads to localized bubbles where the field remains trapped behind the barrier. In such models, therefore, we have two distinct channels for PBH production: the standard adiabatic density perturbation channel and the bubble channel. Here, we perform numerical simulations of bubble formation, addressing the issues of initial conditions, critical amplitude and bubble expansion. Further, we explore the scaling behaviour of the co-moving size of bubbles with the initial amplitude of the field fluctuation. We find that for small to moderate non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}\lesssim 2.6$, the threshold for the formation of vacuum bubbles agrees with previous analytical estimates arXiv:1908.11357 to $5\%$ accuracy or so. We also show that the mass distribution for the two channels is different, leading to a slightly broader range of PBH masses. The bubble channel is subdominant for small $f_{\rm NL}$, and becomes dominant for $f_{\rm NL}\gtrsim 2.6$. We find that the mass of PBHs in the bubble channel is determined by an adiabatic overdensity surrounding the bubble at the end of inflation. Remarkably, the profile of this overdensity turns out to be of type-II. This represents a first clear example showing that overdensities of type-II can be dominant relative to the standard type-I. We also comment on exponential tails and on the fact that in models with local type non-Gaussianity (such as the one considered here), the occurrence of alternative channels can easily be inferred from unitarity considerations.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of horizonless compact objects within astrophysical environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie--Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the nonstandard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. {}Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anticorrelation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau with a sharp transition to slow roll. We focus on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>

Abstract: We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and Second Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impulse for classical black hole scattering at fifth post-Minkowskian (5PM) order by providing the second self-force (2SF) contributions. This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be canceled by contributions from the radiative memory region, while its dimensional-regularisation pole should cancel against the radiative tail region. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of the $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory in a momentum-space Daubechies wavelet basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to investigate nonperturbative dynamics within the Hamiltonian framework. In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 &gt; 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations.</description>
