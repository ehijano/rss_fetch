      <title>Can Close-In Exoplanets form by Pebble Accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pebble accretion is the leading theory for the formation of exoplanets more massive than the Earth. Many parameters influence planet growth in the pebble accretion models. In this paper, we study the influence of pebble fragmentation velocity, turbulence strength, stellar metallicity, stellar mass, and planet location on the growth of planets located within 1 au from their parent stars. Analysing the close-in planets from NASA's Exoplanet Archive, we find that the turbulence strength influences planet growth more than the pebble fragmentation velocity does. Planets orbiting stars with higher metallicity have an overall higher probability of reaching their pebble isolation mass than those orbiting lower metallicity stars, but the impact of metallicity is not as high as that of stellar mass, orbital separation, and most importantly disc turbulence.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Free-floating Planet Mass Function with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-floating planets comprise one of the most enigmatic populations of exoplanets in the Galaxy. Though ground-based observations point to a large abundance of these worlds, little is known about their origins and demographics. In the coming years, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is expected to detect several hundred free-floating planets, providing the first opportunity to characterize these worlds at the population level. We present a first study of Roman's prospects for reconstructing the mass distribution of free-floating planets through population-level statistical inference. We find that depending on the true underlying mass distribution of free-floating planets in the Galaxy, Roman will be able to improve upon existing estimates of the abundance by orders of magnitudes in the largely unexplored mass range below that of Earth. When applied to Roman's observations, the methodology we present herein will be capable of discriminating between different hypothesized mass distributions at high statistical significance, opening a new window into the origins of these rogue worlds.</description>

      <title>Reduced solar quadrupole moment compensates for lack of asteroids in long-term solar system integrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art long-term solar system integrations include several second order effects such as the Sun's quadrupole moment J2 and a contribution from asteroids (plus the Moon and general relativity). We recently showed that including 10 asteroids and a reduced J2 in our astronomical solutions provides the best match with geologic data to -58 Myr. However, the rationale for the reduced J2 remained ambiguous and may suggest that parameters for long-term integrations compatible with geologic observations are not fully compatible with our knowledge of the current solar system (specifically J2). Here we show that a reduced J2 compensates for a diminished asteroid population in long-term solar system integrations, which may appear surprising. We present an analysis and offer a mechanism for the long-term compensating effects of J2 and asteroid mass in the solar system (not planetary systems in general). Our analysis suggests that "differential effects" on specific secular frequencies involved in resonant terms (i.e., (g4-g3) and (s4-s3)), are critical in the long term, rather than short-term effects on the orbital elements of individual planetary orbits across the board. Also, our results indicate that if long-term intergrations including the full asteroid population were computationally feasible, a J2 value (within errors) compatible with our current knowledge of the solar system could be used. Attempts to improve the long-term accuracy of astronomical solutions by, e.g., tinkering with initial conditions using current/future astronomical observations are futile unless asteroid deficiencies in the solar system model are addressed.</description>

      <title>On the secular evolution of the semi-major axis in canonical formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several astrophysical configurations where one is interested only in the long-term dynamical evolution. Although the first-order version of this approximation is usually sufficient in applications, second-order corrections may be relevant, too. Here we use the Hamiltonian formalism to show how such higher-order terms lead to the long-term evolution of the semi-major axis.</description>

      <title>Attitude Control of Spacecraft for Autonomous Attenuation of Unknown Periodic Disturbance Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep space exploration, especially focusing on halo orbits, the periodic orbits of the Moon, has been widely studied. The spacecraft in halo orbits performs periodic orbital motion, which affects the attitude motion by periodic disturbances. The conventional attitude control method, PD control, is widely used, but its application to periodic disturbance attenuation is inefficient. To address these challenges, this study proposes a predictive Repetitive Control (RC) approach that addresses periodic disturbances, particularly GG torque, by exploiting the periodic nature of the system dynamics. The proposed method is also applied to the case of using a Reaction Wheel (RW) as an attitude control actuator. Despite the inherent challenges posed by RW limitations, including saturation torque and transmission delay, our predictive RC approach effectively mitigates these effects. Numerical simulations demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method in maintaining attitude control for spacecraft traversing halo orbits near the Earth-Moon $L_2$ point, validating its potential for future deep space exploration missions.</description>

      <title>Dust density enhancements and the direct formation of planetary cores in gravitationally unstable discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation via core accretion involves the growth of solids that can accumulate to form planetary cores. There are a number of barriers to the collisional growth of solids in protostellar discs, one of which is the drift, or metre, barrier. Solid particles experience a drag force that will tend to cause them to drift towards the central star in smooth, laminar discs, potentially removing particles before they grow large enough to decouple from the disc gas. Here we present 3-dimensional, shearing box simulations that explore the dynamical evolution of solids in a protostellar disc that is massive enough for the gravitational instability to manifest as spiral density waves. We expand on earlier work by considering a range of particle sizes and find that the spirals can still enhance the local solid density by more than an order of magnitude, potentially aiding grain growth. Furthermore, if solid particles have enough mass, and the particle size distribution extends to sufficiently large particle sizes, the solid component of the disc can undergo direct gravitational collapse to form bound clumps with masses typically between $1$ and $10$ M$_\oplus$. Thus, the concentration of dust in a self-gravitating disc could bypass the size barrier for collisional growth and directly form planetary cores early in the lifetime of the disc.</description>

      <title>Thermal evolution model from cometary nuclei to asteroids considering contraction associated with ice sublimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet--asteroid transition (CAT) objects are small solar system bodies in the process of evolving from cometary nuclei into asteroids, as they gradually lose volatile substances due to solar heating. The volatile material is mainly water ice, and the time required for its complete depletion is called the desiccation time. Estimating the desiccation time is important for examining the formation and evolution of small solar system bodies. Here, we propose a new theoretical model for evaluating the desiccation time as a function of orbital elements, considering the contraction of the entire cometary nucleus due to ice sublimation. First, we performed numerical calculations of the thermal evolution of a cometary nucleus in an eccentric orbit, considering the seasonal variation in the solar heating rate. Next, we derived the desiccation time analytically as a function of orbital elements based on a steady-state model considering the solar heating rate averaged over the seasons. We compared the numerical solutions for the desiccation time with the analytical solutions and clarified the conditions under which the analytical model can be applied. Additionally, based on the analytical model, we derived formulae for estimating the emission rates of water vapor and dust on the surface of the cometary nucleus, the maximum size of the emitted dust, and the dust emission velocity, by assuming the amount of ice remaining inside the nucleus. Using these analytical solutions, we considered the internal structure and evolution process of typical CAT objects. Our analytical model was generally consistent with that of the results of earlier observations of these objects. Our model provides a theoretical guideline for discussing the evolution of cometary nuclei and the possibility of retaining internal ice in asteroids.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength JWST observations of (3200) Phaethon show a dehydrated object with an aqueously altered origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST observations of the near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to further investigate the composition of Phaethon's surface. Our NIRSpec data confirms that Phaethon's surface is dehydrated, showing no evidence of hydrated minerals in the 3-$\mu$m region. We estimate an upper limit on the hydrogen content in phyllosilicates of 0.06 wt%. Comparisons with laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites suggest that Phaethon's surface composition is best matched by thermally metamorphosed samples of the CM chondrite Murchison (heated to 1000$^{\circ}$C), rather than CY meteorites as previous work suggested. We find no evidence of ongoing surface evolution due to recent perihelion passages. A comparison of the mid-infrared spectra of Phaethon and Bennu shows distinct spectral differences that are consistent with their different thermal histories. Our findings further refine our understanding of Phaethon's current surface composition and evolution and provide additional insights for the upcoming DESTINY+ mission.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ideal spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) is proven to be a quantum-optimal tool for exoplanet detection, i.e., asymmetric source discrimination. However, recent investigations into the related problems of separation estimation and symmetric source discrimination showed its efficiency to be limited in the presence of noise. In this work, we use analytical tools to scrutinize the practical applicability of SPADE and derive the associated optimal decision strategy for exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections. On the one hand, we find that the probability of detection of noisy SPADE has the same scaling with planet-star separation and relative brightness as conventional techniques, such as direct imaging and coronagraphs. On the other hand, we prove that, due to a superior scaling coefficient under realistic noise conditions, SPADE remains the most efficient method for practical exoplanet detection in the sub-Rayleigh regime.</description>

      <title>Emergence of wind ripples controlled by mechanics of grain-bed impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic sediment patterns have been observed on Earth in riverbeds and sand and snow deserts, but also in other planetary environments. One of the most ubiquitous patterns, familiar wind or 'impact' ripples, adorns sand beaches and arid regions on Earth. The observation of aeolian impact ripples on Mars the same size as their terrestrial counterparts despite a thinner atmosphere raises questions about their formation. Here we show in a numerical simulation that the emergent wavelength of impact ripples is controlled by the mechanics of grain-bed impacts and not the characteristic trajectories of grains above the bed. We find that the distribution of grain trajectories in transport is essentially scale-free, invoking the proximity of a critical point and precluding a transport-related length scale that selects ripple wavelengths. By contrast, when a grain strikes the bed, the process leading to grain ejections introduces a collective granular length scale that determines the scale of the ripples. We propose a theoretical model that predicts a relatively constant ripple size for most planetary conditions. In addition, our model predicts that for high-density atmospheres, such as on Venus, or for sufficiently large sand grains on Earth, impact ripples propagate upwind. Although wind-tunnel and field experiments are needed to confirm the existence of such 'antiripples', we suggest that our quantitative model of wind-blown sediment transport may be used to deduce geological and environmental conditions on other planets from the sizes and propagation speeds of impact ripples.</description>

      <title>Rossby wave instability in weakly ionized protoplanetary disks. II. radial B-fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our first paper in this series, we investigate the impact of radial magnetic fields and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects - specifically, Ohmic resistivity, Hall drift, and ambipolar diffusion - on RWI unstable modes. The presence of a radial field is linked to the disk's vertical shear and vertical magnetic field. We perform radially global linear analyses and utilize the spectral code \textsc{Dedalus} to solve the matrix eigenvalue problems. Our findings reveal that radial fields exhibit behavior similar to vertical fields. In the ideal MHD limit, radial fields enhance the effect of vertical fields in reducing growth rates, with significant reductions starting at relatively weak field strengths, around $\beta \sim 10^3 - 10^4$, which are relevant to protoplanetary disks. In the non-ideal MHD limit, all three non-ideal effects, when sufficiently strong, cause the growth rates to closely resemble those observed in hydrodynamic models.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Disk Winds in Protoplanetary Disks: Differentiating Magnetized and Photoevaporative Outflows With Fully Coupled Thermochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetized winds and photoevaporative winds are critical in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution. Using 2D axisymmetric (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations with Athena++ implementing fully coupled thermochemistry, we investigate the signatures of the two winds in CO and [C~I] ALMA observations, and examine the potential to distinguish the origins. Our simulations reveal fundamental differences between the two winds: magnetized winds are colder and denser, exhibiting super-Keplerian rotation with small poloidal velocities of $\lesssim 1~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$ in the atmosphere ($z/R\gtrsim0.45$), while photoevaporative winds are hotter and less dense, exhibiting sub-Keplerian rotation with higher poloidal velocity of several ${\rm km~s}^{-1}$. In addition to previously identified factors like thermal pressure gradient and disk's self-gravity, we demonstrate that magnetic tension/pressure and advection significantly influence rotational velocities of the gas in the wind, which lead to emission patterns that are distinct from Keplerian rotation in synthetic ALMA observations. Magnetized winds are visible in CO channel maps when wind loss rates are $\gtrsim10^{-8}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. When wind loss rates are lower, magnetized winds produce subtle perturbations in channel maps, which resemble the so-called ``velocity kinks'' produced by protoplanets. While photoevaporative winds dissociate CO through strong XUV radiation and thus are weaker in CO, they can create observable ring-like substructures. [C~I] emission is optically thin and could be most effective at detecting both winds in disks with high gas mass and/or high [C~I] abundance. Due to the spatially extended nature of the winds, using a large beam ($\simeq0.4$" for disks in nearby star-forming regions) will be helpful regardless of the tracer used.</description>

      <title>An MHD Simulation of the Possible Modulations of Stellar CMEs Radio Observations by an Exoplanetary Magnetosphere</title>

Abstract: Type II radio bursts are the indicator of adverse space weather in a stellar system. These radio bursts are the consequence of shock wave acceleration due to the coronal mass ejection (CME). In this study, we conduct a series of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of CME-driven star-planet systems to investigate how close-in exoplanets modulate radio burst characteristics. We use a model for the stellar wind with a close-in exoplanet, and a CME model based on the eruption of a flux rope. We are able to generate synthetic radio burst images from our MHD simulations. We find that radio burst like phenomena is most likely to be observed for moderately active solar like stars and close-in exoplanetary systems have significant influence on the nature of radio burst spectrum. We find that when the exoplanet's magnetic field is relatively weak, its magnetosphere compresses the CME plasma, increasing local density and shifting the radio emission to higher frequencies. Conversely, a strong planetary magnetic field results in a large magnetosphere that prevents effective CME-shock development, producing weaker radio emission concentrated at lower frequencies, particularly at the flanks of the CME. For highly active solar-like stars, strong overlying stellar magnetic fields suppress the CME shock, greatly diminishing radio burst visibility. For HD 189733 (moderate stellar field), only intensity difference is visible when the CME arrives the planet. We also do not find significant modulation in the radio emission by a close-in exoplanet system when the stellar magnetic field is complex. In summary, our findings highlight that the nature of the radio burst spectrum is strongly dependent on both the topology of the stellar magnetic field and the magnetic strength of close-in exoplanets.</description>

Abstract: Forward modeling is often used to interpret substructures observed in protoplanetary disks. To ensure the robustness and consistency of the current forward modeling approach from the community, we conducted a systematic comparison of various hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes. Using four grid-based hydrodynamics codes (FARGO3D, Idefix, Athena++, PLUTO) and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code (Phantom), we simulated a protoplanetary disk with an embedded giant planet. We then used two radiative transfer codes (mcfost, RADMC-3D) to calculate disk temperatures and create synthetic 12CO cubes. Finally, we retrieved the location of the planet from the synthetic cubes using DISCMINER. We found strong consistency between the hydrodynamics codes, particularly in the density and velocity perturbations associated with planet-driven spirals. We also found a good agreement between the two radiative transfer codes: the disk temperature in mcfost and RADMC-3D models agrees within $\lesssim 3~\%$ everywhere in the domain. In synthetic $^{12}$CO channel maps, this results in brightness temperature differences within $\pm1.5$ K in all our models. This good agreement ensures consistent retrieval of planet's radial/azimuthal location with only a few % of scatter, with velocity perturbations varying $\lesssim 20~\%$ among the models. Notably, while the planet-opened gap is shallower in the Phantom simulation, we found that this does not impact the planet location retrieval. In summary, our results demonstrate that any combination of the tested hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes can be used to reliably model and interpret planet-driven kinematic perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the community studying the effect of ultraviolet radiation environment, predominantly set by OB stars, on protoplanetary disc evolution and planet formation. This is important because a significant fraction of planetary systems, potentially including our own, formed in close proximity to OB stars. This is a rapidly developing field, with a broad range of observations across many regions recently obtained or recently scheduled. In this paper, stimulated by a series of workshops on the topic, we take stock of the current and upcoming observations. We discuss how the community can build on this recent success with future observations to make progress in answering the big questions of the field, with the broad goal of disentangling how external photoevaporation contributes to shaping the observed (exo)planet population. Both existing and future instruments offer numerous opportunities to make progress towards this goal.</description>
