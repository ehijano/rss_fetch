      <title>Orientations of cycles in digraphs of high chromatic number and high minimum out-degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize all orientations of cycles $C$ for which for every fixed $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ there exists a constant $c \geq 1$ such that every digraph $D$ without loops or parallel arcs with $\chi(D) \geq c$ and minimum out-degree at least $\varepsilon |V(D)|$ contains $C$ as a subdigraph. This generalizes a result of Thomassen.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable cycle-contraction minors of large $2$-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that every sufficiently large connected graph has, as an induced subgraph, $K_n$, $K_{1,n}$, or an $n$-vertex path. A 2023 paper of Allred, Ding, and Oporowski identified the unavoidable induced subgraphs of sufficiently large $2$-connected graphs. In this paper, we establish a dual version of this theorem by focusing on the minors obtained by contracting cycles, the dual operation of deleting vertices.</description>

      <title>Symmetric statistics on rational Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational Dyck paths are the rational generalization of classical Dyck paths. They play an important role in Catalan combinatorics, and have multiple applications in algebra and geometry. Two statistics over rational Dyck paths called run and ratio-run are introduced. They both have symmetric joint distributions with the return statistic. We give combinatorial proofs and algebraic proofs of the symmetries, generalizing a result of Li and Lin.</description>

      <title>Every Non-regular Subcubic Graph is (1,1,2,2)-Packing Colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a non-decreasing sequence of integers $S=(s_1,s_2, \dots, s_k)$, an $S$-packing coloring of $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$ subsets $V_1,V_2,\dots,V_k$ such that the distance between any two distinct vertices $x,y \in V_i$ is at least $s_{i}+1$, $1\leq i\leq k$. Gastinau and Togni posed the question of whether every subcubic graph admits a $(1,1,2,2)$-packing coloring, except for the Petersen graph, which admits a $(1, 1, 2,2, 3)$-packing coloring. While several studies have investigated this question for special classes of subcubic graphs, a complete solution remains open. In this paper, we make progress toward answering this question by proving that every non-regular subcubic graph is $(1,1,2,2)$-packing colorable.</description>

      <title>On the maximum partial-dual genus of a planar graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an embedded graph and $A$ an edge subset of $G$. The partial dual of $G$ with respect to $A$, denoted by $G^A$, can be viewed as the geometric dual $G^*$ of $G$ over $A$. If $A=E(G)$, then $G^A=G^*$. Denote by $\gamma(G^A)$ the genus of the embedded graph $G^A$. The maximum partial-dual genus of $G$ is defined as $$^\partial\gamma_{M}(G):=\max_{A \subseteq E(G)}\gamma(G^A).$$ For any planar graph $G$, it had been proved that $^\partial\gamma_{M}(G)$ does not rely on the embeddings of $G$. In this paper, we further prove that if $G$ is a connected planar graph of order $n\geq 2$, then $^{\partial}\gamma_{M}(G)\geq \frac{n-n_2-2n_1}{2}+1$, where $n_i$ is the number of vertices of degree $i$ in $G$. As a consequence, if $G$ is a connected planar graph of order $n$ with minimum degree at least 3, then $^{\partial}\gamma_{M}(G) \geq \frac{n}{2}+1$. Denote by $G^c$ the complement of a graph $G$ and by $\chi(G^c)$ the chromatic number of $G^c$. Moreover, we prove that if $G \ncong K_4$ is a $\lambda$-edge-connected planar graph of order $n$, then $^{\partial}\gamma_{M}(G) \geq f(n,\lambda,\chi(G^c))$, where $f(n,\lambda,\chi(G^c))$ is a function of $n$, $\lambda$ and $\chi(G^c)$. The first lower bound is tight for any $n$, and the second lower bound is tight for some 3-edge-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Pretty good fractional revival on abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a graph with the adjacency matrix $A$. The transition matrix of $\Gamma$, denoted $H(t)$, is defined as $H(t) := \exp(-\textbf{i}tA)$, where $t$ is a real variable and $\textbf{i} := \sqrt{-1}$. The graph $\Gamma$ is said to exhibit pretty good fractional revival (PGFR in short) between the vertices $a$ and $b$ if there exists a sequence of real numbers $\{t_k\}$ such that $\lim_{k\to\infty} H(t_k){\textbf{e}_{a}} = \alpha{\textbf{e}_{a}} + \beta{\textbf{e}_{b}}$, where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$ with $\beta \neq 0$ and $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. In this paper, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of PGFR on abelian Cayley graphs. Using that necessary and sufficient condition, we obtain some infinite classes of circulant graphs exhibiting PGFR. We also obtain some classes of circulant graphs not exhibiting PGFR. Some of our results generalize the results of Chan et al. [Pretty good quantum fractional revival in paths and cycles. \textit {Algebr. Comb.} 4(6) (2021), 989-1004.] for cycles. We also prove that an unitary Cayley graph on $n$ vertices ($n \geq 4$) exhibits PGFR if and only if $n = 2p$, where $p$ is a prime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider some simple combinatorial game and a winning strategy in this game. This game is then used to prove several known results about non-repetitive sequences and approximations with denominators from a lacunary sequence. In this way we simplify the proofs, improve the bounds and get for free the computable versions that required a separate treatment.</description>

      <title>On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. %Let $k$ be the number of vertices of such a longest path of $T$ that every vertex of %the path is a cut vertex and that every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $T$. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $n+k &lt; N$. A \textit{configuration} of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A \textit{move} is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to %its unoccupied neighbour. some unoccupied neighbor. The {\it pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$} is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequence of the pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is in $O(Nn + n^2 \log(\min\{n,k\}))$ if $G$ is a $N$-vertex tree, and it is in $O(N^2 + \frac{n^3}{N-n} + n^2 \log(\min\{n,N-n\}))$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. We provide an algorithm that can obtain a solution sequence of lengths that satisfy these orders, with the same computational complexity as the order of the length.

      <description>arXiv:2503.20582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be orthogonalisable if the set of real symmetric matrices whose off-diagonal pattern is prescribed by its edges contains an orthogonal matrix. We determine some necessary and some sufficient conditions on the sizes of the connected components of two graphs for their join to be orthogonalisable. In some cases, those conditions coincide, and we present several families of joins of graphs that are orthogonalisable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For real application and theoretical investigation of ordinary hypergraphs and non-ordinary hypergraphs, researchers need to establish standard rules and feasible operating methods. We propose a visualization tool for investigating hypergraphs by means of the natural topological structure of finite sets and their subsets, so we are able to construct various non-ordinary hypergraphs, and to reveal topological properties (such as hamiltonian cycles, maximal planar graphs), colorings, connectivity, hypergraph group, isomorphism and homomorphism of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>On perfect subdivision tilings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given graph $H$, we say that a graph $G$ has a perfect $H$-subdivision tiling if $G$ contains a collection of vertex-disjoint subdivisions of $H$ covering all vertices of $G.$ Let $\delta_{\mathrm{sub}}(n, H)$ be the smallest integer $k$ such that any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $k$ has a perfect $H$-subdivision tiling. For every graph $H$, we asymptotically determined the value of $\delta_{\mathrm{sub}}(n, H)$. More precisely, for every graph $H$ with at least one edge, there is an integer $\mathrm{hcf}_{\xi}(H)$ and a constant $1 &lt; \xi^*(H)\leq 2$ that can be explicitly determined by structural properties of $H$ such that $\delta_{\mathrm{sub}}(n, H) = \left(1 - \frac{1}{\xi^*(H)} + o(1) \right)n$ holds for all $n$ and $H$ unless $\mathrm{hcf}_{\xi}(H) = 2$ and $n$ is odd. When $\mathrm{hcf}_{\xi}(H) = 2$ and $n$ is odd, then we show that $\delta_{\mathrm{sub}}(n, H) = \left(\frac{1}{2} + o(1) \right)n$.</description>

      <title>Towards a high-dimensional Dirac's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dirac's theorem determines the sharp minimum degree threshold for graphs to contain perfect matchings and Hamiltonian cycles. There have been various attempts to generalize this theorem to hypergraphs with larger uniformity by considering hypergraph matchings and Hamiltonian cycles. In this paper, we consider another natural generalization of perfect matchings, Steiner triple systems. As a Steiner triple system can be viewed as a partition of pairs of vertices, it is a natural high-dimensional analogue of a perfect matching in graphs. We prove that for sufficiently large integer $n$ with $n \equiv 1 \text{ or } 3 \pmod{6}$, any $n$-vertex $3$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with minimum codegree at least $\left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{57}}{12} + o(1) \right)n = (0.879... + o(1))n$ contains a Steiner triple system. In fact, we prove a stronger statement by considering transversal Steiner triple systems in a collection of hypergraphs. We conjecture that the number $\frac{3 + \sqrt{57}}{12}$ can be replaced with $\frac{3}{4}$ which would provide an asymptotically tight high-dimensional generalization of Dirac's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a vector $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k) \in \mathbb{F}_2^k$, we say a collection of subsets $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies $\alpha$-intersection pattern modulo $2$ if all $i$-wise intersections consisting of $i$ distinct sets from $\mathcal{F}$ have size $\alpha_i \pmod{2}$. In this language, the classical oddtown and eventown problems correspond to vectors $\alpha=(1,0)$ and $\alpha=(0,0)$ respectively. In this paper, we determine the largest such set families of subsets on a $n$-element set with $\alpha$-intersection pattern modulo $2$ for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}_2^3$ and all $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}_2^4$ asymptotically. Lastly, we consider the corresponding problem with restrictions modulo $3$.</description>

A graph $G$ has the constrained Ramsey property for $(H_1,H_2)$ if every edge-colouring of $G$ contains either a monochromatic copy of $H_1$ or a rainbow copy of $H_2$. Our main result gives a 0-statement for the constrained Ramsey property in $G(n,p)$ whenever $H_1 = K_{1,k}$ for some $k \ge 3$ and $H_2$ is not a forest. Along with previous work of Kohayakawa, Konstadinidis and Mota, this resolves the constrained Ramsey property for all non-trivial cases with the exception of $H_1 = K_{1,2}$, which is equivalent to the anti-Ramsey property for $H_2$.
  For a fixed graph $H$, we say that $G$ has the anti-Ramsey property for $H$ if any proper edge-colouring of $G$ contains a rainbow copy of $H$. We show that the 0-statement for the anti-Ramsey problem in $G(n,p)$ can be reduced to a (necessary) colouring statement, and use this to find the threshold for the anti-Ramsey property for some particular families of graphs.</description>

      <title>A Dirac-type theorem for arbitrary Hamiltonian $H$-linked digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices, let $\mathcal{P}(D)$ be the family of all directed paths in $D$, and let $H$ be a digraph with the arc set $A(H)=\{a_1, \ldots, a_k\}$. The digraph $D$ is called arbitrary Hamiltonian $H$-linked if for any injective map $f: V(H)\rightarrow V(D)$ and any integer set $\mathcal{N}=\{n_1, \ldots, n_k\}$ satisfying that $n_i\geq4$ for each $i\in\{1, \ldots, k\}$, there is a map $g: A(H)\rightarrow \mathcal{P}(D)$ such that for every arc $a_i=uv$, $g(a_i)$ is a directed path from $f(u)$ to $f(v)$ of length $n_i$, and different arcs are mapped into internally vertex-disjoint directed paths in $D$, and $\bigcup_{i\in[k]}V(g(a_i))=V(D)$. Here, the length of a directed path is defined as the number of its arcs.
  In this paper, we prove that for any digraph $H$ with $k$ arcs and $\delta(H)\geq1$, there exists a constant $C_0=C_0(k)$ such that if $D$ is a digraph of order $n\geq C_0$ and minimum in- and out-degree at least $n/2+k$, then it is arbitrary Hamiltonian $H$-linked. The lower bound on the minimum in- and out-degree is best possible. We further prove a more general form that allows $k$ to be linear in $n$, while imposing some restrictions on the lengths of the subdivided arcs. As corollaries, we solved a conjecture of Wang \cite{Wang} for sufficiently large graphs, and partly answered a problem raised by Pavez-Sign\'{e} \cite{Pavez}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dirac's theorem states that any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with even integer $n$ satisfying $\delta(G) \geq n/2$ contains a perfect matching. We generalize this to $k$-uniform linear hypergraphs by proving the following. Any $n$-vertex $k$-uniform linear hypergraph $H$ with minimum degree at least $\frac{n}{k} + \Omega(1)$ contains a matching that covers at least $(1-o(1))n$ vertices. This minimum degree condition is asymptotically tight and obtaining a perfect matching is impossible with any degree condition. Furthermore, we show that if $\delta(H) \geq (\frac{1}{k}+o(1))n$, then $H$ contains almost spanning linear cycles, almost spanning hypertrees with $o(n)$ leaves, and ``long subdivisions'' of any $o(\sqrt{n})$-vertex graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a graphical map: a visual and numerical correspondence between circular electrical networks and circular planar split systems. When restricted to the \emph{planar} circular electrical case, this graphical map finds the split system uniquely associated with the Kalmanson resistance distance of the dual network, matching the induced split system familiar from phylogenetics. This correspondence is extended to compactifications of the respective spaces, taking cactus networks to the cactus split systems defined herein. The graphical map preserves both network components and cactus structure, allowing an elegant enumeration of induced phylogenetic split systems. We introduce the global spaces of circular planar electrical networks and circular split systems. These are CW complexes, and the 0-cells of each are counted by the Bell numbers as opposed to the Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>On Positive and Negative $r$-th Power Energy of Graphs with Edge Addition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the positive and negative $r$-th power energy of graphs and their behavior under edge addition. Specifically, we extend the classical notions of positive and negative square energies to the $r$-th power energies, denoted as $s^{+}_r(G)$ and $s^{-}_r(G)$, respectively. We derive bounds for $s^{+}_r(G)$ and $s^{-}_r(G)$ under edge addition, which provide tighter bounds when $r=2$ compared to those of Abiad et al. Moreover, we address the problem of monotonicity of the positive $r$-th power energy under edge addition, providing a family of counterexamples for $ 1 \leq r &lt; 3 $. Finally, we reformulate Guo's conjecture, suggesting that the monotonicity property may hold for $ r \geq 3 $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two types of problems: maximising, over subsets $S\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$, the density of $d$-subcubes $C$ in the $n$-hypercube graph that span a subgraph such that $S\cap C$ is i) isomorphic to the given configuration $H\subseteq\{0,1\}^d$ (the inducibility problem), or ii) has the given size $s$ (the statistics problem). Using flag algebras, we determine the limit of this density as $n\to\infty$ for 5 new configurations $H\subseteq\{0,1\}^3$ and for 3 new pairs $(d,s)$, namely for $(3,2)$, $(4,2)$ and $(4,4)$. Interestingly, the lower bounds in the last three cases come from blowups of small Hamming codes.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a work of Fu-So-Song, we associate a symmetric matrix $A$ to a plane vector sequence $v$ and give a formula to find the signature of $A$ in terms of the sequence $v$. When $A$ is nonsingular, we interpret the relation between $A$ and $A^{-1}$ from a topological viewpoint. Finally, we associate an omnioriented quasitoric orbifold $X$ of real dimension four to the sequence $v$ and show that $A^{-1}$ is the intersection matrix of the characteristic suborbifolds of $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen the development of path homology and magnitude homology -- two homology theories of directed graphs, each satisfying classic properties such as Kunneth and Mayer-Vietoris theorems. Recent work of Asao has shown that magnitude homology and path homology are related, appearing in different pages of a certain spectral sequence. Here we study the target of that spectral sequence, which we call reachability homology. We prove that it satisfies appropriate homotopy invariance, Kunneth, excision, and Mayer-Vietoris theorems, these all being stronger than the corresponding properties for either magnitude or path homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph rewriting is a popular tool for the optimisation and modification of graph expressions in domains such as compilers, machine learning and quantum computing. The underlying data structures are often port graphs - graphs with labels at edge endpoints. A pre-requisite for graph rewriting is the ability to find graph patterns. We propose a new solution to pattern matching in port graphs. Its novelty lies in the use of a pre-computed data structure that makes the pattern matching runtime complexity independent of the number of patterns. This offers a significant advantage over existing solutions for use cases with large sets of small patterns.
  Our approach is particularly well-suited for quantum superoptimisation. We provide an implementation and benchmarks showing that our algorithm offers a 20x speedup over current implementations on a dataset of 10000 real world patterns describing quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Ordering and Convergence of Large Degrees in Random Hyperbolic Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the asymptotic behaviour of large degrees in random hyperbolic graphs, for all values of the curvature parameter $ \alpha$. We prove that, with high probability, the node degrees satisfy the following ordering property: the ranking of the nodes by decreasing degree coincides with the ranking of the nodes by increasing distance to the centre, at least up to any constant rank. In the scale-free regime $ \alpha&gt;1/2$, the rank at which these two rankings cease to coincide is $n^{1/(1+8 \alpha)+o(1)}$. We also provide a quantitative description of the large degrees by proving the convergence in distribution of the normalised degree process towards a Poisson point process. In particular, this establishes the convergence in distribution of the normalised maximum degree of the graph. A transition occurs at $ \alpha = 1/2$, which corresponds to the connectivity threshold of the model. For $ \alpha &lt; 1/2$, the maximum degree is of order $n - O(n^{ \alpha + 1/2})$, whereas for $ \alpha \geq 1/2$, the maximum degree is of order $n^{1/(2 \alpha)}$. In the cases $ \alpha &lt; 1/2$ and $ \alpha &gt; 1/2$, the limit distribution of the maximum degree belongs to the class of extreme value distributions (Weibull for $ \alpha &lt; 1/2$ and Fr\'echet for $ \alpha &gt; 1/2$). This refines previous estimates on the maximum degree for $ \alpha &gt; 1/2$ and extends the study of large degrees to the dense regime $ \alpha \leq 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We
  prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra. These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formul\ae\ for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of denominator vectors can be extended to all generic basis elements of upper cluster algebras in a natural way. Under a weakened version of generic pairing assumption, we provide a representation-theoretic interpretation for this extended notion. We derive several consequences in this generality. We present a counterexample to the conjecture that distinct cluster monomials have distinct denominator vectors. Utilizing a new rank function called the Schur rank, we extend the notion of compatibility degree. As an application, we find a tropical method to compute the multiplicity of a real component in the canonical decomposition of $\delta$-vectors.</description>

Abstract: In this note I demonstrate that the collection of Dynkin systems on finite sets assembles into a Connes-Consani $\mathbb{F}_1$-module, with the collection of partitions of finite sets as a sub-module. The underlying simplicial set of this $\mathbb{F}_1$-module is shown to be isomorphic to the delooping of the Krasner hyperfield $\mathbb{K}$, where $1+1=\{0,1\}$. The face and degeneracy maps of the underlying simplicial set of the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions correspond to merging partition blocks and introducing singleton blocks, respectively. I also show that the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions cannot correspond to a set with a binary operation (even partially defined or multivalued) under the ``Eilenberg-MacLane'' embedding. These results imply that the $n$-fold sum of the Dynkin $\mathbb{F}_1$-module with itself is isomorphic to the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of the discrete projective geometry on $n$ points.</description>
