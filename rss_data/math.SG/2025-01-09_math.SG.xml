      <title>On the existence of Hamiltonian 4-manifolds with a contact type boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Hamiltonian group actions on closed symplectic manifolds have been widely explored throughout the last couple of decades, the study on Hamiltonian group actions on symplectic manifolds with a contact type boundary has started only recently, with the work by Niederkr\"uger and the author [MN]. In this note we pursue this study by presenting several methods to construct such Hamiltonian circle manifolds in dimension 4.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of the pearly tree immersed Lagrangian Floer theory and the Hamiltonian immersed Lagrangian Floer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove an equivalence relation between the immersed Lagrangian Floer theory, defined using pearly tree discs, and local Hamiltonian flows, i.e., Hamiltonian flows performed in the Weinstein tubular neighborhood. This is a generalization of Alston-Bao's work.</description>

      <title>An open-closed Deligne-Mumford field theory associated to a Lagrangian submanifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L \subset X$ be a compact embedded Lagrangian in a compact symplectic manifold. We present the moduli spaces of holomorphic maps of arbitrary genus with boundary on $L$ as a global Kuranishi chart, generalising the work of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirschi-Swaminathan. We use this to define an open-closed Deligne-Mumford theory whose open genus zero part is the Fukaya $A_\infty$ algebra associated to $L$, and whose closed part gives the Gromov--Witten theory of $X$. Combined with results of Costello, this has applications in obtaining Gromov--Witten invariants from the Fukaya category.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial construction of symplectic 6-manifolds via bifibration structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bifibration structure on a $6$-manifold is a map to either the complex projective plane $\mathbb{P}^2$ or a $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^1$, such that its composition with the projection to $\mathbb{P}^1$ is a ($6$-dimensional) Lefschetz fibration/pencil, and its restriction to the preimage of a generic $\mathbb{P}^1$-fiber is also a ($4$-dimensional) Lefschetz fibration/pencil. This object has been studied by Auroux, Katzarkov, Seidel, among others. From a pair consisting of a monodromy representation of a Lefschetz fibration/pencil on a $4$-manifold and a relation in a braid group, which are mutually compatible in an appropriate sense, we construct a bifibration structure on a closed symplectic $6$-manifold, producing the given compatible pair as its monodromies. We further establish methods for computing topological invariants of symplectic $6$-manifolds, including Chern numbers, from compatible pairs. Additionally, we provide an explicit example of a compatible pair, conjectured to correspond to a bifibration structure derived from the degree-$2$ Veronese embedding of the $3$-dimensional complex projective space. This example can be viewed as a higher-dimensional analogue of the lantern relation in the mapping class group of the four-punctured sphere. Our results not only extend the applicability of combinatorial techniques to higher-dimensional symplectic geometry but also offer a unified framework for systematically exploring symplectic $6$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Reduction by stages for affine W-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a pair of nilpotent orbits in a simple Lie algebra, one can associate a pair of vertex algebras called affine W-algebras. Under some compatibility conditions on these orbits, we prove that one of these W-algebras can be obtained as the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the other. This property is called reduction by stages. We provide several examples in classical and exceptional types.
  To prove reduction by stages for affine W-algebras, we use our previous work on reduction by stages for the Slodowy slices associated with these nilpotent orbits, these slices being the associated varieties of the W-algebras. We also prove and use the fact that each W-algebra can be defined using several equivalent BRST cohomology constructions: choosing the right BRST complexes allows us to connect the two W-algebras in a natural way.</description>
