      <title>Different Forms of Imbalance in Strongly Playable Discrete Games II: Multi-Player RPS Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classic Rock-Paper-Scissors, RPS, has seen many variants and generalizations in the past several years. In the previous paper, we defined playability and balance for games. We used these definitions to show that different forms of imbalance agree on the most balanced and least balanced form of playable two-player n-object RPS games, referred to as (2,n)-RPS. We reintroduce these definitions here and show that, given a conjecture, the generalization of this game for m&lt;50 players is a strongly playable RPS game. We also show that this game maximizes these forms of imbalance in the limit as the number of players goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Necessity of Conserved Quantities for Axiomatic Completeness of Classical Economic Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many economic theories have been introduced over the course of history to articulate our understanding of the economy. Classical theories by Adam Smith and David Ricardo's Comparative Advantage have been foundational for the last century's work. Improvements have been achieved over time, incorporating insights from many disparate fields of study: contemporary frameworks like Behavioural Economics and Information Economics, which incorporate psychological insights and deviation from rational decision-making and insights from network theory and how the information flow affects the market behaviour, respectively. In this paper, I motivate the necessity of incorporating insights from Physics, and also show that trade as a phenomenon described by the comparative advantage theory cannot exist without the law of conservation of Energy, and incorporating this law leads to axiomatic completeness of the theory. Further, I also argue that while the economy is not a zero-sum game in terms of wealth, it does require at least one associated zero-sum parameter for trade and economy as phenomena to exist.</description>

      <title>Selling supplemental information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider an environment in which a decision maker faces uncertainty and privately holds information in the form of a signal about the true state of the world. The decision maker purchases additional information from a data broker before receiving the signal realization. I characterize the data broker's optimal selling mechanism, which involves screening over all possible signals. I allow the space of all signals the data broker can sell to be arbitrarily correlated with the signal the decision maker owns. This plays a key role in designing the optimal menu. In the binary action setting, the data broker extracts the efficient surplus by offering a distinct binary signal for each type. Moreover, this result holds even when the broker does not know the prior distribution over states. In more general environments, I provide conditions on the payoff structure and the decision maker's type space under which the data broker extracts the efficient surplus. I discuss scenarios in which efficient surplus extraction is not possible.</description>

      <title>Quantum realism and its contradictions: a contribution form the social sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The text points out that one of the main contradictions of quantum realism, which is particularly relevant to the social sciences, is the tension between the existence of an observer-independent reality and the idea that this reality is mediated by the cognitive and interpretative processes of the subject. This contradiction arises from the central role of the observer in phenomena such as the collapse of the wave function and their influence on the construction of reality, which challenges the classical notion of an objective, non-perceptual nature. Moreover, the encounter between social realism and social interpretivism lies in the fact that, in the social sciences, it is also recognized that human interpretations and actions shape social reality, creating a scenario in which absolute objectivity becomes difficult to sustain. These tensions, therefore enrich the epistemological and ontological debate, showing that the contradictions of quantum realism transcend physics and connect deeply with the difficulties and dynamics of the social construction of reality.</description>

      <title>On Three-Layer Data Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09697v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a three-layer data market comprising users (data owners), platforms, and a data buyer. Each user benefits from platform services in exchange for data, incurring privacy loss when their data, albeit noisily, is shared with the buyer. The user chooses platforms to share data with, while platforms decide on data noise levels and pricing before selling to the buyer. The buyer selects platforms to purchase data from. We model these interactions via a multi-stage game, focusing on the subgame Nash equilibrium. We find that when the buyer places a high value on user data (and platforms can command high prices), all platforms offer services to the user who joins and shares data with every platform. Conversely, when the buyer's valuation of user data is low, only large platforms with low service costs can afford to serve users. In this scenario, users exclusively join and share data with these low-cost platforms. Interestingly, increased competition benefits the buyer, not the user: as the number of platforms increases, the user utility does not necessarily improve while the buyer utility improves. However, increasing the competition improves the overall utilitarian welfare. Building on our analysis, we then study regulations to improve the user utility. We discover that banning data sharing maximizes user utility only when all platforms are low-cost. In mixed markets of high- and low-cost platforms, users prefer a minimum noise mandate over a sharing ban. Imposing this mandate on high-cost platforms and banning data sharing for low-cost ones further enhances user utility.</description>

      <title>The Relationship between Consumer Theories with and without Utility Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study the assumption that the utility maximization hypothesis implicitly adds to consumer theory, we consider a mathematical representation of pre-marginal revolution consumer theory based on subjective exchange ratios. We introduce two axioms on subjective exchange ratio, and show that both axioms hold if and only if consumer behavior is consistent with the utility maximization hypothesis. Moreover, we express the process for a consumer to find the transaction stopping point in terms of differential equations, and prove that the conditions for its stability are equal to the two axioms introduced in the above argument. Therefore, the consumer can find his/her transaction stopping point if and only if his/her behavior is consistent with the utility maximization hypothesis. In addition to these results, we discuss equivalence conditions for axioms to evaluate their mathematical strength, and methods for expressing the theory of subjective exchange ratios in terms of binary relations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Evidence Disclosure: Delay the Good to Accelerate the Bad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamic tradeoff between generating and disclosing evidence. Agents are tempted to delay investing in a new technology in order to learn from information generated by the experiences of others. This informational free-riding is collectively harmful as it slows down learning and innovation adoption. A welfare-maximizing designer can delay the disclosure of previously generated information in order to speed up adoption. The optimal policy transparently discloses bad news and delays good news. This finding resonates with regulation demanding that fatal breakdowns be reported promptly. The designer's intervention makes all agents better off.</description>

      <title>Self-Equivalent Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a novel stability axiom for stochastic voting rules, called self-equivalence, by which a society considering whether to replace its voting rule using itself will choose not to do so. I then show that under the unrestricted strict preference domain, a voting rule satisfying the democratic principles of anonymity, optimality, monotonicity, and neutrality is self-equivalent if and only if it assigns to every voter equal probability of being a dictator (i.e., uniform random dictatorship). Thus, any society that desires stability and adheres to the aforementioned democratic principles is bound to either employ the uniform random dictatorship or decide whether to change its voting rule using a voting rule other than itself.</description>

      <title>Contrarian Motives in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21446v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sequential social learning with endogenous information acquisition when agents have a taste for nonconformity. Each agent observes predecessors' actions, decides whether to acquire a private signal (and how precise it should be), and then chooses between two actions. Payoffs value correctness and include a bonus for taking the less popular action among predecessors; because this bonus depends only on observed popularity, the equilibrium analysis avoids fixed points in anticipated popularity and preserves standard Bayesian updating. In a Gaussian-quadratic setting, optimal actions follow posterior thresholds that tilt against the majority, and we solve the precision choice problem. Whenever the no-signal decision aligns with the observed majority, stronger contrarian motives weakly raise the value of information and expand the set of histories in which agents invest. We provide compact comparative statics for thresholds, action probabilities, and the precision argmax, a local welfare-and-information treatment, and applications to scientific priority races, cultural diffusion, and online platforms.</description>

      <title>A Note on Qualified Majority Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note characterizes every qualified majority voting rule in environments with just two alternatives through anonymity, responsiveness, and q-neutrality. Crucially, the latter imposes independence of the labels of the alternatives if and only if some alternative is strictly top-ranked by at least q voters. Thus, this note generalizes May's (1952, Theorem, p. 682) characterization of the simple majority voting rule to qualified majority voting rules. In doing so, it shows that qualified majority voting rules are distinguished by their degree of neutrality.</description>

      <title>The Strength of Local Structures in Decentralized Network Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study dynamic network formation games in which agents meet stochastically and form links based on their valuation of the network. I show that these games can be represented in terms of the values agents assign to network sub-structures. Particularly, this characterizes potential games as those where all participants in a structure value it equally. When valuations are restricted to a finite set of repeated sub-structures, or motifs, the model exhibits phase transitions: small changes in motif values cause discontinuous shifts in network density.</description>

      <title>Market Design for Capacity Sharing in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a market mechanism that sets edge prices to incentivize strategic agents to efficiently share limited network capacity. In this market, agents form coalitions, with each coalition sharing a unit capacity of a selected route and making payments to cover edge prices. Our focus is on the existence and computation of market equilibrium, where challenges arise from the interdependence between coalition formation among strategic agents with heterogeneous preferences and route selection that induces a network flow under integral capacity constraints. To address this interplay between coalition formation and network capacity utilization, we introduce a novel approach based on combinatorial auction theory and network flow theory. We establish sufficient conditions on the network topology and agents' preferences that guarantee both the existence and polynomial-time computation of a market equilibrium. Additionally, we identify a particular market equilibrium that maximizes utilities for all agents and the outcome is equivalent to the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. Furthermore, we extend our results to multi-period settings and general networks, showing that when the sufficient conditions are not met, an equilibrium may still exist but requires more complex, path-based pricing mechanisms that set differentiated prices based on agents' preference parameters.</description>
