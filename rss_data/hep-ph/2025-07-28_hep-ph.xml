      <title>Diagonalising the LEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We organise the four-fermion vector current interactions below the weak scale -- i.e., in the low energy effective field theory (LEFT) -- into irreps of definite parity and $SU(N)$ flavour symmetry. Their coefficients are thus arranged into small subsets with distinct phenomenology, which are significantly smaller than traditional groupings of operators by individual fermion number. As these small subsets only mix among themselves, we show that the renormalisation group evolution is soluble semi-analytically, and examine the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the one- and two-loop running. This offers phenomenological insights, for example into the radiative stability of lepton flavour non-universality. We use these to study model-independent implications for $b\to s \tau \tau$ decays, as well as setting indirect bounds on flavour changing four-quark interactions.</description>

      <title>Dominance of scale anomaly in confining pressure inside pions on light front in the top-down holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the energy density and the stress distribution inside the pion derived from gravitational form factors in top-down holographic QCD. In particular, we show that the dominance of the scale anomaly in the confining pressure, previously observed in the instant form for the nucleon, also holds for the pion in the light-front form. Furthermore, we find that in large-$N_c$ QCD described by this approach, the scalar glueball plays a mediating role in transmitting the confining pressure. These findings support the universal role of the scale anomaly in the stability of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Can WIMPs Survive a Magnetized Early Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) can seed additional small-scale matter fluctuations, leading to the formation of dense, early-collapsing dark matter structures known as minihalos. These minihalos may dramatically amplify the dark matter annihilation signal if dark matter is composed of self-annihilating thermal relic particles such as WIMPs. In this work, we explore the viability of this scenario by analysing the annihilation signal from minihalos with prompt central cusps, $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$, formed due to the enhanced power spectrum induced by PMFs. Using observational constraints from the Virgo cluster and incorporating benchmark values for the magnetic field strength motivated by cosmological phase transitions such as the electroweak and QCD phase transitions, as well as the best-fit value from DESI and Planck data, we derive constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section. We find that large portions of the WIMP parameter space are excluded, and magnetic fields produced during phase transitions with temperatures $T \lesssim 100 \, \rm{GeV}$ disfavour dark matter masses below $400 \, \rm{GeV}$. Notably, magnetic fields generated at or below the QCD phase transition scale, or with amplitudes favored by current cosmological data, are in strong tension with self-annihilating WIMPs across a wide mass range extending beyond the $\mathrm{TeV}$ scale. Our results establish indirect detection as a sensitive probe of the interplay between early-universe magnetogenesis and the microphysics of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling of linear power corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-perturbative corrections to hadronic observables represent a critical obstacle to increasing accuracy at colliders. Long taken to scale simply as $1/Q$, where $Q$ is the centre-of-mass scattering energy, recent work has opened the path towards calculating the anomalous dimension that modifies that scaling. A priori, the problem is complex, requiring a resummation involving arbitrary numbers of large-angle and low-energy gluons. Within a specific framework for kinematic recoil, we show that it reduces to a simple exponential for key observables like the thrust, $C$-parameter and energy correlators. This simplicity holds for a specific hadron mass scheme, and also even beyond the two-jet limit.</description>

      <title>Color-glass condensate beyond the Gaussian approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the high-energy limit, perturbative calculations in QCD are conveniently done using the dipole picture which factorizes the scattering amplitude into a perturbative part and the nonperturbative scattering off the nuclear target, described using correlators of Wilson lines. These correlators can be computed in the color-glass condensate effective field theory by using a Gaussian model for the color density of the target. In this work, we generalize the Gaussian model to a generic function that is local in the transverse coordinates and the light-cone time, and show how to compute physical Wilson-line correlators in this model. We also consider a simple model for the color density based on stable probability distributions and show that the small-dipole behavior of the dipole amplitude is modified from quadratic to a power law, where the power is given by the stability parameter of the distribution. This generalization of the Gaussian model is suitable for numerical applications in the high-energy limit and can be used in future phenomenological studies of the nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Axial-vector molecular structures $B_{c}^{\ast \pm} B_{c}^{\mp}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axial-vector molecular structure $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}=(B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{-} + B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+})/2$ is explored in QCD sum rule framework. The mass and current coupling of this compound are found by means of the two-point sum rule method. It turns out that the mass of $\mathcal{M} _{\mathrm{AV}}$ is equal to $m=(12770 \pm 60)~\mathrm{MeV}$ making possible its dissociations to pairs of $J/\psi \eta_b$, $\Upsilon \eta_c$, $ B_{c}^{\ast +} B_{c}^{-}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+}$ mesons. The partial widths of these decay modes contain the strong couplings at $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$-meson-meson vertices which are calculated by utilizing the three-point sum rule method. The full decay width of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ is formed due to these dominant processes and amounts to $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}]=(93 \pm 14)~ \mathrm{MeV}$. Our results for parameters $m$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{AV}}]$ of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ are useful for experimental studies of various fully heavy four-quark mesons.</description>

      <title>Oscillation Baryogenesis via Ultraviolet Dark Matter Freeze-In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate baryogenesis from dark matter oscillations in the ultraviolet freeze-in regime. We find that the mechanism can simultaneously accommodate the observed abundances of baryons and dark matter for dark matter masses in the 10 keV to MeV range, provided the reheat temperature lies between the temperature of the electroweak phase transition and ~10 TeV. The mechanism predicts observable consequences due to the presence of a light dark matter component that is relativistic during structure formation, and X-ray bounds on decaying dark matter can set strong constraints depending on the operator mediating dark matter production.</description>

      <title>Return of the Lepton Number: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production and the Revival of the Shi-Fuller Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism, revisiting its cosmological viability in light of recent results demonstrating that lepton-number asymmetries $L_\alpha \gtrsim 1$ at temperatures $T &gt; 20\rm\,MeV$ are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using a quasi-classical Boltzmann transport calculation of the dark matter production, we compute the non-thermal phase space distributions of sterile neutrinos across a broad range of particle mass $m_s$ and mixing angle $\sin^2{(2\theta)}$ parameter space. We then evolve the resulting distributions through linear structure formation using CLASS and fit the resulting matter power spectra to thermal warm dark matter (WDM) transfer functions, enabling a direct mapping between SF models and equivalent thermal WDM particle masses $m_{\mathrm{th}}$. This allows us to reinterpret existing structure formation limits and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest preferences in the context of SF production. We find that lepton asymmetries $L \gtrsim 0.5$ at high temperatures open significant viable parameter space in the $m_s \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $\sin^2 (2\theta) \lesssim 10^{-14}$ regime, compatible with both X-ray constraints from NuSTAR and INTEGRAL/SPI and recent Lyman-$\alpha$ inferences of $m_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.1\,\mathrm{keV}$. Following lepton number evolution below 20 MeV, we also specifically show that this lepton asymmetry parameter space is compatible with BBN and cosmic microwave background constraints. We present updated constraints, a refined $m_{\mathrm{th}}$ fitting function, and power-law approximations for $L$ across the parameter space. Our results motivate future X-ray observations targeting the $\sim 20$ keV photon regime and testing of the $m_\mathrm{th} \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ WDM region.</description>

      <title>Freezeout at constant energy density and spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the local equilibrium density operator, we develop a geometry-informed linear response theory that takes into account the parameterization of the freezeout hypersurface before the gradient expansion is carried out. Assuming local equilibrium on an iso-energy density hypersurface, we study the $\Lambda$ hyperon spin polarization, and compute corrections to the isothermal case due to finite density. We argue that corrections to isothermal freezeout should be small, and that even in heavy ion collisions with energy as low as $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 11.5$ GeV they constitute at most a $10\%$ effect. They may, however, become relevant for local polarization observables.</description>

      <title>Particle Correlations in Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study particle correlations in high energy jets by comparing the measured energy-energy correlator (EEC) with that constructed from two individual energy flows with respect to the jet axis. This comparison demonstrates that genuine correlations exists for small angle and moderate/large angle, indicating that they are coming from correlated splitting. This method will provide a unique tool to disentangle different physics, by comparing the genuine correlations in jet EEC between heavy ion collisions and proton-proton collisions. It will help to expose the medium modification of parton splitting in hot QCD medium. On the other hand, the medium responses are expected to be canceled out in the genuine correlations.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network Driven Simulation Based Inference Method for Pole Position Estimation under Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation Based Inference (SBI) is shown to yield more accurate resonance parameter estimates than traditional chi-squared minimization in certain cases of model misspecification, demonstrated through a case study of pi-pi scattering and the rho(770) resonance. Models fit to some data sets using chi-squared minimization can predict inaccurate pole positions for the rho(770), while SBI provides more robust predictions across the same models and data. This result is significant both as a proof of concept that SBI can handle model misspecification, and because accurate modeling of pi-pi scattering is essential in the study of many contemporary physical systems (e.g., a1(1260), omega(782)).</description>

      <title>Structure of heavy quarkonia under strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural modifications of heavy quarkonia in the presence of strong magnetic fields using a constituent quark model. By incorporating the effects of spin mixing and quark Landau levels, we employ a nonrelativistic Hamiltonian that captures the essential features of quark dynamics in a magnetic field. The two-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved using the cylindrical Gaussian expansion method, which respects the cylindrical symmetry induced by a magnetic field. We extract the corresponding light-front wave function (LFWF) densities and analyze their transverse and longitudinal structures, revealing characteristic features such as transverse momentum broadening. While the longitudinal structure is only slightly modified within the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian, we discuss some corrections that can significantly affect its longitudinal structure. Furthermore, we discuss the structure modifications of excited states and find notable changes in the LFWF densities, and state reshuffling near avoided crossings. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of hadron structure to external magnetic fields and help bridge our understanding to relativistic approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, as experimental data on the excited $\Xi(1620)$ and $\Xi(1690)$ states have accumulated, theoretical analyses based on chiral dynamics have also been actively pursued. In this study, we construct theoretical models within the chiral unitary approach to reproduce recent experimental data, and perform a model interpolation to examine the relationship between the poles appearing in different models. We then calculate the invariant mass spectra of the $\pi^+\Xi^-$ system in the $\Xi_c \to \pi\pi\Xi$ decay, using the scattering amplitudes obtained from each model, to investigate how the distinct pole structures influence the observable spectrum.</description>

      <title>NRQCD Re-Confronts LHCb Data on Quarkonium Production within Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare LHCb measurements of $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ transverse momentum distributions within jets with QCD calculations, which may be crucial in understanding the quarkonium production mechanism. Our theoretical calculations are based on the fragmenting jet function formalism, while the nonperturbative formation of quarkonia is described by the nonrelativistic QCD factorization formalism. We include the newest refinements in the perturbative calculation including resummation of threshold and DGLAP logarithms. We find that the $\psi(2S)$ data has the potential to discriminate between the different production mechanisms proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Determination of the sensitivity of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda^+_c$ electric dipole moments using a full angular analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for a non-zero Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of particles, which is a clear signal of a violation of CP symmetry, is one of the unique ways to discover physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we discuss a method for determining the EDM of baryons from the full angular distribution of final particles in electron-positron pair annihilation processes. The question of how accurately the state-of-the-art experiments can determine EDM of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons is discussed in detail. Investigating the pseudo-statistics that corresponds to the BESIII experiment, the estimated sensitivity for $\Lambda$ EDM is obtained at the level of $10^{-18}$ e$\cdot$cm. The similar figure for the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) experiment is found to be of the order of $10^{-20}$ e$\cdot$cm. For the $\Lambda_c^+$ EDM, the calculated sensitivity for the STCF experiment is $10^{-16}$ e$\cdot$cm. The case of a polarized initial electron is considered separately as such an option is planned at the STCF experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on the spin alignment of the $\phi$ vector meson in the hadronic phase of the Quark Gluon Plasma, by including effects of nucleon scatterings. The emission rates are calculated in a realistic hydrodynamic background simulated with the code Fluid$u$m, for different beam energies. We find that all the effects taken into account cannot explain the out-of-plane spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the $\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow\bar{K}^0\eta p$ reaction: the role of $N^*(1535),~ N^*(1650)$ and $\Sigma(1620)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical study of the weak decay $\Lambda_c^+ \rightarrow \bar{K}^0 \eta p$ using a coupled-channel chiral unitary approach that incorporates both pseudoscalar-baryon and vector-baryon interactions. Our framework includes contributions from both internal and external weak emission mechanisms, as well as strong final state interactions. We assume that the $N^*(1535)$ and $N^*(1650)$ resonances are dynamically generated through meson-baryon scattering and they appear as distinct structures in the $\eta p$ invariant mass distributions. {A clear peak also appears in the $\bar{K}^0 p$ invariant mass distribution around 1620~MeV, associated with the dynamically generated $\Sigma(1620)$ resonance.} Notably, this work provides the first theoretical description of the simultaneous observation of these two related $N^*$ resonances in the same meson-baryon final state. Our results highlight the crucial role of final state interaction and the interplay between different weak decay topologies in shaping the resonance patterns. These findings offer new insights into the nature of nucleon excitations and support the interpretation of $N^*(1535)$ and $N^*(1650)$ as dynamically generated states. {Moreover, the identification of the $\Sigma(1620)$ further supports the picture of hadronic molecular structures emerging from meson-baryon interactions in the non-perturbative QCD regime.}</description>

      <title>Quark models: What can they teach us?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark models have a more than 60-year history and through this time they served as a powerful investigation and prediction tool in hadronic physics. In recent years, a lot of new experimental information has been arriving on hadrons that do not qualify as simple quark model states. Yet, quark models remain the cornerstone of the classification scheme for hadrons, provide valuable insights into various phenomena inherent in QCD, and facilitate gaining a clear and physically transparent picture of the underlying physics. In the spotlight of this review is a chiral quark model inspired by quantum field theory approach to confined quarks. The model is well suited for studies of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the vacuum of QCD as well as its implications in the spectrum of hadrons. It can also be employed to investigate chiral restoration at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Is flavor discrete?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relevance of the discrete symmetries for explanation of the observed flavor structures in the leptonic sector is considered. Achievements of the "traditional'' discrete symmetry and the modular symmetry approaches are confronted. Minimal models with small number of parameters do not work. Complication of symmetry prescriptions allow to introduce new free parameters and thus describe the data but simultaneously bring two connected problems: (i) problem of "missing" representations, and (ii) problem of selection of certain point in huge discrete parameter space formed by possible charge assignments. Both must be addressed in complete model. Alternatively, one can keep minimal symmetry prescription but extend models introducing new physics not related to the original flavor symmetry. The low energy predictions can be "polluted" by various additional physics which includes effects of hidden sector, RGE running, decoupling of heavy degrees of freedom, mixing with sterile neutrinos, etc. The set up with discrete symmetries in the Hidden sector which communicates with the visible one via the neutrino portal and the basis fixing symmetry still looks promising.</description>

      <title>EVAluation of the Equivalent Vector Boson Approximation at highest energy colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collider processes at the highest available partonic center-of-mass energies - 10 TeV and above - exhibit a new regime of electroweak interactions where electroweak gauge bosons mostly act as quasi-massless partons in vector boson fusion processes. We scrutinize these processes using the Equivalent Vector boson Approximation (EVA) based on its implementation in the Monte Carlo generator framework Whizard. Using a variety of important physics processes, including top pairs, Higgs pairs, neutrino pairs, and vector boson pairs, we study the behavior of processes initiated by transverse and longitudinal vector bosons, both $W$ and $Z$ induced. The flexibility of our framework allows to study such processes at different high-energy colliders, such as a muon collider or a high-energy proton collider like FCC-hh. Studying a set of differential distributions, we show which scale choices are the most preferable ones to best approximate results based on full matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Determination of the $\phi$-meson production process and its absorption cross section via directed flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the directed flow of $\phi$-mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV, is sensitive on production and the absorption cross section of the $\phi$ in a nuclear medium. This provides a new observable to constrain the in-medium properties of the $\phi$ which is independent of its absolute production rate. It is shown that the STAR data disfavor any significant $\phi$-N absorption in dense nuclear matter and are consistent with a very small cross section of the $\phi$ comparable to the vacuum cross section. The similarity of the $\phi$-meson and proton directed flow also indicates that the $\phi$ is produced in conjunction with a baryon.</description>

      <title>An analytic result for the $0 \to ggHHH$ amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully analytic calculation of the leading-order one-loop amplitude for triple Higgs production via gluon fusion, $gg \to HHH$, retaining full dependence on the mass of the heavy quark circulating in the loop. This amplitude provides a direct probe of the triple and quartic Higgs self-couplings, the measurement of which is a central goal of current and future colliders. The amplitude can be presented in compact form thanks to the use of analytic reconstruction techniques, based on finite-field and $p$-adic evaluations, partial fraction decompositions, and primary decompositions to identify common numerator factors. Our results provide a compact and efficient representation of the matrix element for this process, enabling evaluations that are more than an order of magnitude faster than existing numerical alternatives.</description>

      <title>Pushing the hybrid approach to low beam energies with dynamic initial conditions from hadronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While hybrid approaches of relativistic hydrodynamics+transport have been well established for the dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions at high beam energies, moving to lower beam energies is challenging. In this work, we propose dynamic initial conditions for the viscous hydrodynamic evolution in heavy-ion collisions at low to intermediate beam energies. They are comprised of core hadrons based on the local energy density during the pre-equilibrium hadronic evolution. The SMASH-vHLLE hybrid approach is then applied to lower beam energies, achieving good agreement with measured bulk observables between $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 3$ and $9.1\ \mathrm{GeV}$, thus providing guidance for measurements in STAR-BES and CBM at FAIR. This framework has the advantage that the equation of state of dense QCD matter is a direct input to the calculation, so the current results can be regarded as a baseline with respect to future studies of the phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy New Physics models with lepton flavour-changing interactions are motivated by neutrino masses, and generically induce dipole interactions for leptons, which can be flavour-changing ($l_j\to l_i \gamma$) or flavour-diagonal (magnetic and electric dipole moments(edms)). We focus on models with complex couplings, and where the singlet Standard Model leptons ($\{e_R^i\}$) do not interact with the New Physics. In such models, edms are calculated to arise at two loops, despite that complex amplitudes for $l_j\to l_i \gamma$ appear at one loop. We explore whether the extra loop suppression of edms survives flavour basis rotations that could be induced by flavour-changing NP contributions to the charged lepton mass matrix. We show that one-loop edms vanish in both the mass and Yukawa eigenstate bases.</description>

      <title>Initial conditions and bulk viscosity effects on $\Lambda$ polarization in high-energy heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$ spin polarization is a crucial probe of the gradients of velocity and temperature in the quark-gluon plasma generated in heavy-ion collisions. However, it is still not systematically used to tune hydrodynamic models. In this work, we investigate the influence of different initial conditions and parametrization of the bulk viscosity on $\Lambda$ polarization, showing that they affect the local polarization significantly. These results highlight the impact that the use of local polarization can have on refining theoretical models. Finally, we compare our results, including feed-down corrections, with experimental data from high-energy heavy-ion collisions at STAR and ALICE, and demonstrate the crucial role of bulk viscosity in generating the correct sign of longitudinal polarization at LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>Insight-HXMT Spectral and Timing Studies of a Giant Outburst in RX J0440.9+4431</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0440.9+4431 underwent a giant outburst in late 2022 and lasted three months. The Insight-HXMT has observed this source at several instances of the entire outburst in 2022-2023. We used these bright outburst observations of the pulsar to study its X-ray spectral and timing variability. The pulse profiles obtained at similar luminosity during the progress and declining phases of the outburst show a similar shape behavior.With the increase in source luminosity, the complex pulse profile with multiple peaks at low luminosity becomes a single peaked pulse profile at the high luminosity at the outburst peak. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1-120 keV are explained with an absorbed cutoff power-law continuum model. During the outburst phases, we have found the evidence of a cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the spectra varying in energies ($\sim$ 33.6- 41.6 keV) having broad linewidth &gt; 5 keV . In declining phases of the outburst, we have also found the hints of first cyclotron harmonic varying in 65-75 keV . The application of thermal and bulk Comptonization model to the phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra reveals a high surface magnetic field ($B \sim 10^{13}$ G) for the pulsar.</description>

      <title>Relativistic scalar dark matter drag forces on a black hole binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter around black holes can induce drag forces through dynamical friction and accretion, potentially affecting the orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission of binary systems. While dynamical friction from scalar field dark matter has been studied in the relativistic regime for single black holes, the case of a binary black hole (BBH) has remained unexplored. As a first step, we present a series of two-dimensional general-relativistic simulations of BBH in a wind tunnel for an asymptotically homogeneous scalar field background. We extract the drag forces, torque, mass and charge accretion acting on the binary, and analyze their dependence on the binary separation, velocity and the scalar field parameters. We find that the binary's drag is not a simple superposition of two isolated black holes; the presence of a companion modifies the gravitational wake and yields significant nonlinearities. This additional force and torque can (in principle) modify the inspiral and induce a dephasing of the gravitational wave signal.</description>

      <title>Classification of flavor dependence of Chiral Magnetic Effect with Deep Neural Network using multiple correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the flavor dependence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) by analyzing two key charge-separation correlators used to characterize the charge separation effect: the conventional $\Delta\gamma$ and the recently proposed $R_{\psi_2}$. Using the AMPT (A Multiphase Transport) model with an initial-state centrality-dependent charge separation, we evaluate the sensitivity of these correlators to 2-flavor ($u,d$) and 3-flavor ($u,d,s$) quark scenarios. While both correlators exhibit modest flavor dependence in mid-central (30-50\%) collisions, their discriminative power varies significantly with centrality and transverse momentum ($p_T$), limiting their utility disentangling the flavor dependent scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we develop a neural network classifier trained on final-state hadronic observables (e.g., $dN_{ch}/d\eta$, $p_T$ spectra). The model achieves $&gt;90\%$ accuracy in flavor classification by leveraging multi-observable correlations, with $p_T$-differential features proving particularly discriminative. Crucially, by incorporating background contributions directly into the training data, our approach provides more reliable flavor estimates than correlator-only methods.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of the highest-energy cosmic-ray events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory: a three-dimensional approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unveiling the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remains one of the main challenges of high-energy astrophysics. Measurements of anisotropies in their arrival directions are key to identifying their sources, yet magnetic deflections obscure direct associations. In this work, we reconstruct the sky regions of possible origin of the highest-energy cosmic-ray events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory by tracing their trajectories through Galactic magnetic fields using up-to-date models, while fully accounting for energy and directional uncertainties. A mixed composition at injection is assumed to model the detected charge distributions of such events. Different classes of astrophysical sources are investigated and tested for a correlation with the inferred regions of origin of the events. By incorporating constraints on the maximum propagation distances, we also allow for a three-dimensional localization of the possible source regions. Our findings provide new constraints on the sources of the highest-energy cosmic particles and offer fresh insights into the role of Galactic magnetic fields in shaping the observed ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray sky.</description>

      <title>Large-scale anisotropies of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are crucial to pinpoint their sources, which are yet to be discovered. A dipolar anisotropy in right ascension above 8~EeV has been detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory with a significance of $6.8 \sigma$. The direction of the dipole suggests an extragalactic origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays above those energies. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the studies on large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory with energy thresholds from $\sim 0.03$~EeV up to $32$~EeV and we present and discuss the recent results achieved with the latest available dataset, which includes 19 years of operations -- resulting in a total exposure of 123,000~km$^2$~sr~yr and nearly 50,000 events above 8~EeV.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Inelastic Proton-Proton Cross-Section at $\sqrt{s} \geq 40$ TeV Using the Hybrid Data of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring proton-proton interaction cross-sections at center-of-mass energies above 40 TeV remains a significant challenge in particle physics. The Pierre Auger Observatory provides a unique opportunity to study the interactions at the highest energies through the distribution of the depth of maximum shower development ($X_\mathrm{max}$) observed by its Fluorescence Detector. In previous studies, the determination of the interaction cross-section at ultrahigh energies has relied on the assumption that the tail of the $X_\mathrm{max}$ distribution is proton-dominated, which restricts the analysis to a limited energy range below the ankle and introduces related systematic uncertainties. In this contribution, we adopt a novel method for the simultaneous estimation of the proton-proton interaction cross-section and the primary cosmic-ray mass composition using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, avoiding assumptions about one quantity to infer the other and thus improving the accuracy and robustness of our analysis. In addition, a systematic shift in the $X_\mathrm{max}$ scale is fitted to account for both experimental uncertainties and theoretical constraints on the modeling of particle interactions. The obtained results are consistent with previous analyses and provide additional constraints on hadronic interaction models. The measured proton-proton inelastic cross-section at ultra-high energies agrees well with extrapolations of accelerator data. The inferred cosmic-ray composition and the $X_\mathrm{max}$-scale shift are also compatible with previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Jet Quenching in Holographic QCD as an Indicator of Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the gauge/gravity duality to study jet quenching (JQ) phenomena in the quark-gluon plasma. For this purpose, we implement holographic QCD models constructed from an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity at finite temperature and finite chemical potential for light and heavy quarks. The models capture both the confinement and deconfinement phases of QCD and the first-order phase transitions. We calculate the JQ parameter in different models and compare them with the experimental data obtained in heavy-ions studies. In particular, we investigate how JQ, as a function of temperature $T$, chemical potential $\mu$, and magnetic field $c_B$, serves as a probe for identifying first-order phase transitions within the $(T,\mu,c_B)$ parameter space of holographic QCD. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of JQ on the parameter $\nu$, which characterizes longitudinal versus transverse anisotropy relative to the heavy-ion collision axis. By analyzing the dependence of the JQ parameters on these thermodynamic variables, we map critical regions associated with phase boundaries. We compare our findings to earlier studies of the running coupling constant's behavior within the gauge-gravity duality framework. This approach provides new insights into the interplay between non-perturbative dynamics and phase structure in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>$CP$ violation in the $HZZ$ vertex and left-right asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate new contributions to the $HZZ$ vertex from the Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) involving the Higgs and $Z$ bosons. Our calculations reveal that the form factors $h_2^V$ and $h_3^V$ ($V=H$, $Z$) can be induced through these couplings, and we present our results in terms of the Passarino-Veltman scalar functions. Using the current limits on $H\overline{t}c$ and $Z\overline{t}c$ couplings, we determine that the new contributions to the $CP$-conserving form factor $h_2^V$ are small compared to the Standard Model (SM) predictions. However, for the $CP$-violating form factor $h_3^V$, the contributions can reach values as high as $10^{-6}$, five orders of magnitude larger than in the SM. Furthermore, we examine how these results influence the left-right asymmetries in the processes $H^\ast\to ZZ$ and $Z^\ast\to ZH$. Our findings suggest that significant deviations from SM predictions may occur when considering FCNC contributions.</description>

Abstract: We present the first global analysis of fragmentation functions (FFs) for light charged hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$) at full next-to-next-to-leading order in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), incorporating world data from both single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering. The collinear factorization has been tested with low-momentum-transfer data and has demonstrated success at high hadron momenta. Additionally, we study the impact of current global data on hadron production to the parton distribution functions (PDFs), and find they favor a reduced asymmetry in the strange (anti-) quark PDFs, as compared to the asymmetry predicted by state-of-the-art PDFs derived from inclusive data.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Unveils the Power Law of Finite-Volume Energy Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-volume extrapolation is an important step for extracting physical observables from lattice calculations. However, it is a significant challenge for the system with long-range interactions. We employ symbolic regression to regress finite-volume extrapolation formula for both short-range and long-range interactions. The regressed formula still holds the exponential form with a factor $L^n$ in front of it. The power decreases with the decreasing range of the force. When the range of the force becomes sufficiently small, the power converges to $-1$, recovering the short-range formula as expected. Our work represents a significant advancement in leveraging machine learning to probe uncharted territories within particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formalize energy-scaling arguments in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to estimate effects of operators up to dimension ten. Introducing a classification based on the number of external legs and an energy-counting parameter, we establish a dual expansion in \(v/\Lambda\) and \(E/\Lambda\). Extending to four-, five-, and six-particle vertices, our framework highlights energy-enhanced operators that dominate high-energy processes at the HL-LHC. This organization streamlines experimental analyses to only include operators with energetic impact in their analyses and enhances the discoverability of new physics within the SMEFT framework.</description>

      <title>Analytic reconstruction with massive particles: one-loop amplitudes for $0 \to \bar{q}qt\bar{t}H$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic reconstruction of one-loop amplitudes for the process $0 \to \bar{q}qt\bar{t}H$. Our calculation is a novel use of analytic reconstruction, retaining explicit covariance in the massive spin states through the massive spinor-helicity formalism. The analytic reconstruction relies on embedding the massive five-point kinematics in a fully massless eight-point phase space while still building a minimal ansatz directly in the five-point phase space. In order to obtain compact analytic expressions it is necessary to identify suitable partial fraction decompositions and extract common numerator factors, which we achieve through careful inspection of limits in which pairs of denominators vanish. We find that the resulting amplitudes are more numerically efficient than ones computed using automatic methods but that the gains are not as significant as in the massless case, at least at present. The method opens the door to applications at two-loop order, where numerical efficiency and improvements in the reconstruction methodology are more crucial, especially with regards to the number of free parameters in the ansatz.</description>

Abstract: We present the second part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions for the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale (LEFT): the baryon-number-violating sector at dimension six in the power counting. We obtain the results in two different schemes: in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations; and in naive dimensional regularization, which in the considered sector of the theory does not lead to any ill-defined $\gamma_5$-odd traces. Our results are of interest for a reanalysis of the constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model from proton-decay searches within an EFT framework at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Hybrid Inflation with K\"{a}hler-Induced $\mathbf{R}$-Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of explicit nonrenormalizable $R$-symmetry breaking interactions in the context of supersymmetric hybrid inflation. In particular, we focus on scenarios where such breaking arises predominantly from the K\"{a}hler potential, while the renormalizable terms in both the superpotential and K\"{a}hler potential preserve $R$-symmetry. Incorporating radiative corrections, soft SUSY-breaking contributions, and supergravity effects, we construct a consistent and predictive inflationary framework. Notably, the presence of $R$-symmetry violating terms at the nonrenormalizable level helps resolve the common issue of light waterfall fields in grand unified theories, rendering them sufficiently heavy without disturbing gauge coupling unification. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that these $R$-symmetry breaking contributions play a crucial role in bringing the scalar spectral index $n_s$ into excellent agreement with the recent cosmological observations, particularly the Data Release 6 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The tensor-to-scalar ratio remains suppressed, with $r &lt; 10^{-5}$, below the reach of current and near-future experiments. However, observable gravitational waves with $r \lesssim 0.03$ can be achieved by allowing moderate deviations in the parameter space associated with a non-minimal K\"{a}hler potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework based on the standard type-I seesaw model that relates the baryon asymmetry of the universe to the dark matter (DM) density. The framework, which we name "Asymgenesis", relies on the presence of primordial charge asymmetries seeded either in the dark sector or in the visible sector. A higher-dimensional portal operator reshuffles this initial asymmetry into both sectors, eventually resulting in a nonzero $B-L$ asymmetry and an asymmetric DM component. Compared to conventional asymmetric-dark-matter (ADM) schemes, our framework imposes far milder requirements on the portal interaction. In particular, the portal interaction need not violate $B-L$, and the temperature scales of efficient $B-L$ violation and efficient charge-transfer interaction mediated by the portal operator can be separated. We develop the formalism in detail and argue that the flexibility of our framework enlarges the model-building landscape for ADM.</description>

      <title>Shear transport in far-from-equilibrium isotropization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We holographically study the far-from-equilibrium isotropization dynamics of the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The dual gravitational background is driven to be out of equilibrium and anisotropic by a time-dependent change in boundary conditions. At late times, the system relaxes and asymptotically approaches a static configuration. The large initial energy densities accelerate the isotropization significantly compared to the initial geometry corresponding to the supersymmetric Yang-Mills vacuum. We analyze shear transport during isotropization by directly computing the time-dependent stress tensor, which is now a nonlinear function of the shear rate. The shear viscosity far from equilibrium displays much richer dynamics than its near-equilibrium counterpart. Moreover, we uncover that the equilibrium viscosity-to-entropy ratio at late times depends on the details of the quench function and the initial data, which could be due to a resummation of the hydrodynamic description. In particular, this ratio can be parametrically smaller than the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound calculated from linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Flavor Physics at the CEPC: a General Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the landscape of flavor physics at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), based on the nominal luminosity outlined in its Technical Design Report. The CEPC is designed to operate in multiple modes to address a variety of tasks. At the $Z$ pole, the expected production of 4 Tera $Z$ bosons will provide unique and highly precise measurements of $Z$ boson couplings, while the substantial number of boosted heavy-flavored quarks and leptons produced in clean $Z$ decays will facilitate investigations into their flavor physics with unprecedented precision. We investigate the prospects of measuring various physics benchmarks and discuss their implications for particle theories and phenomenological models. Our studies indicate that, with its highlighted advantages and anticipated excellent detector performance, the CEPC can explore beauty and $\tau$ physics in ways that are superior to or complementary with the Belle II and Large-Hadron-Collider-beauty experiments, potentially enabling the detection of new physics at energy scales of 10 TeV and above. This potential also extends to the observation of yet-to-be-discovered rare and exotic processes, as well as testing fundamental principles such as lepton flavor universality, lepton and baryon number conservation, etc., making the CEPC a vibrant platform for flavor physics research. The $WW$ threshold scan, Higgs-factory operation and top-pair productions of the CEPC further enhance its merits in this regard, especially for measuring the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements, and Flavor-Changing-Neutral-Current physics of Higgs boson and top quarks. We outline the requirements for detector performance and considerations for future development to achieve the anticipated scientific goals.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from vacuum bubbles: Ultraviolet dependence on wall thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from the first-order phase transition can be characterized by a few phenomenological parameters but with high degeneracies in model/data distinguishments. In this paper, we look into the high-frequency power law of the GW spectrum with preliminary numerical simulations for both quantum and semiclassical pictures of vacuum decay. We first reveal an anticorrelation of the high-frequency power law to a certain power of the ratio between the wall thickness and bubble radius at the onset of bubble collisions, which can be further approximated analytically by some other phenomenological model characteristics to break the model degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Reionization and the Hubble Constant: Correlations in the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found early galaxies producing photons from more efficient ionization than previously assumed. This may suggest a reionization process with a larger reionization optical depth, $\tau_{\rm reio}$, in some mild disagreement with that inferred from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Intriguingly, the CMB would prefer larger values of $\tau_{\rm reio}$, more consistent with the recent JWST hint, if the large-scale measurements (i.e. $\ell &lt;30$) of E-mode polarization are removed. In addition, $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has an indirect correlation with today's Hubble constant $H_0$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Motivated by these interesting observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-$\ell$ polarization data as a proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$. We further explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and late universe measurements of $H_0$, in $\Lambda$CDM as well as two proposals to alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy (EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for almost all cases due to the larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and its positive correlation with $H_0$, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI data.</description>

      <title>Renormalising the Field-Space Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of one-loop quantum corrections in scalar effective field theories from a geometric viewpoint, emphasizing the role of field-space curvature and its renormalisation. By treating the scalar fields as coordinates on a Riemannian manifold, we exploit field redefinition invariance to maintain manifest coordinate independence of physical observables. Focusing on the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and \(\phi^4\) theory, we demonstrate how loop corrections induce momentum- and scale-dependent shifts in the curvature of the field-space manifold. These corrections can be elegantly captured through the recently proposed geometry-kinematics duality, which generalizes the colour-kinematics duality in gauge theories to curved field-space backgrounds. Our results highlight a universal structure emerging in the contractions of Riemann tensors that contribute to renormalisation of the field-space curvature. In particular, we find explicit expressions and a universal structure for the running curvature and Ricci scalar in simple models, illustrating how quantum effects reshape the underlying geometry. This geometric formulation unifies a broad class of scalar EFTs, providing insight into the interplay of curvature, scattering amplitudes, and renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Learnable cut flow for high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tasks in high energy physics, yet their opaque training process renders them as a black box. In contrast, the traditional cut flow method offers simplicity and interpretability but requires extensive manual tuning to identify optimal cut boundaries. To merge the strengths of both approaches, we propose the Learnable Cut Flow (LCF), a neural network that transforms the traditional cut selection into a fully differentiable, data-driven process. LCF implements two cut strategies-parallel, where observable distributions are treated independently, and sequential, where prior cuts shape subsequent ones-to flexibly determine optimal boundaries. Building on this strategy, we introduce the Learnable Importance, a metric that quantifies feature importance and adjusts their contributions to the loss accordingly, offering model-driven insights unlike ad-hoc metrics. To ensure differentiability, a modified loss function replaces hard cuts with mask operations, preserving data shape throughout the training process. LCF is tested on six varied mock datasets and a realistic diboson vs. QCD dataset. Results demonstrate that LCF 1. accurately learns cut boundaries across typical feature distributions in both parallel and sequential strategies, 2. assigns higher importance to discriminative features with minimal overlap, 3. handles redundant or correlated features robustly, and 4. performs effectively in real-world scenarios. In the diboson dataset, LCF initially underperforms boosted decision trees and multiplayer perceptrons when using all observables. However, pruning less critical features-guided by learned importance-boosts its performance to match or exceed these baselines. LCF bridges the gap between traditional cut flow method and modern black-box neural networks, delivering actionable insights into the training process and feature importance.</description>

      <title>Long distance contributions to neutral $D$-meson mixing from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of neutral $D$-meson mixing provides a unique probe of long-distance effects in the charm sector, where Standard Model contributions are dominated by nonperturbative effects. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using spectral reconstruction techniques within lattice QCD to compute the long-distance contributions to $D^0- \bar{D}^0$ mixing. After outlining the general formalism describing neutral meson mixing in the charm sector, we focus on the determination of the mixing amplitudes and the dimensionless parameters $x = \Delta m_D / \Gamma_D$ and $y = \Delta \Gamma_D /(2 \Gamma_D)$, which respectively encode the mass and width differences between the $D$-meson mass eigenstates. We discuss in detail the required theoretical and computational framework, including the definition and renormalization of the four-quark operators entering the $\Delta C = 1$ weak Hamiltonian, and strategies for evaluating the relevant correlation functions employing variance-reduction techniques. To extract the mixing amplitudes, we explore methods for reconstructing the spectral density from lattice correlators, providing preliminary assessments of the data quality required to reach the scaling regime, where the smearing width is small enough to yield physically meaningful results. Our findings lay the groundwork for future precision determinations of long-distance contributions to $D$-meson mixing from first principles.</description>

      <title>Gaussian generally covariant hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a version of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics in a way very different from the usual derivation: Instead of treating it as a coarse-grained deterministic theory expanded in gradients of equilibrium quantities, we treat it as a stochastic theory, characterized by partition functions in each cells, expanded in cumulants. We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow emerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic hydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that linear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results and argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering hope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger remnant: Roles of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($&gt;1\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We argue that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos plays important roles on generating ELN angular crossings. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\sim 1\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Abelian gauge field configurations that carry non-zero instanton number. Each such "Abelian instanton" is generated by a closed magnetic worldline in four-dimensional Euclidean space, provided the Abelian gauge field has non-trivial winding along the closed worldline. The resulting field configuration corresponds to a Euclidean dyon loop featuring non-zero instanton number. We embed these dyon loops in a UV-complete theory using the Georgi-Glashow model and show that the full instanton charge is borne entirely by the unbroken $U(1)$ sector. In this same model, using a numerical relaxation procedure, we show that Euclidean dyon loops are a continuous deformation of small BPST instantons.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Multi-Dimensional Integration with Quantum Adaptive Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm that performs Quantum Adaptive Importance Sampling (QAIS) for Monte Carlo integration of multidimensional functions, targeting in particular the computational challenges of high-energy physics. In this domain, the fundamental ingredients for theoretical predictions such as multiloop Feynman diagrams and the phase-space require evaluating high-dimensional integrals that are computationally demanding due to divergences and complex mathematical structures. The established method of Adaptive Importance Sampling, as implemented in tools like VEGAS, uses a grid-based approach that is iteratively refined in a separable way, per dimension. This separable approach efficiently suppresses the exponentially growing grid-handling computational cost, but also introduces performance drawbacks whenever strong inter-variable correlations are present. To utilize sampling resources more efficiently, QAIS exploits the exponentially large Hilbert space of a Parameterised Quantum Circuit (PQC) to manipulate a non-separable Probability Density Function (PDF) defined on a multidimensional grid. In this setting, entanglement within the PQC captures the correlations and intricacies of the target integrand's structure. Performing measurements on the PQC determines the sample allocation across the multidimensional grid. This focuses samples in the small subspace where the important structures of the target integrand lie, and thus generates very precise integral estimations. As an application, we look at a very sharply peaked loop Feynman integral and at multi-modal benchmark integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the master equation. This makes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), the operator of optimal sensitivity and key quantity in quantum metrology, available to a large class of systems of interest, both in and out-of-equilibrium. We validate our approach by reproducing the SLD for temperature in quantum Brownian motion and demonstrate its versatility by constructing the optimal observable for the non-equilibrium relaxation rate.</description>
