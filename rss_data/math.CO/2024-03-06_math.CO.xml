      <title>Baker-Bowler theory for Lagrangian Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baker and Bowler (2019) showed that the Grassmannian can be defined over a tract, a ring-like structure generalizing both partial fields and hyperfields. This notion unifies theories for matroids over partial fields, valuated matroids, and oriented matroids. We extend Baker-Bowler theory for the Lagrangian Grassmannian which is the set of maximal isotropic subspaces of a $2n$-dimensional symplectic vector space. By Boege et al. (2019), the Lagrangian Grassmannian is parameterized into the projective space of dimension $2^{n-2}(4+\binom{n}{2})-1$ and its image is exactly the solutions of quadrics induced by determinantal identities of principal and almost-principal minors of a symmetric matrix. From the idea that the strong basis exchange axiom of matroids captures the combinatorial essence of the Pl\"{u}cker relations, we define matroid-like objects, called antisymmetric matroids, from the quadrics for the Lagrangian Grassmannian. We also provide its cryptomorphic definition in terms of circuits capturing the orthogonality and maximality of vectors in a Lagrangian subspace. We define antisymmetric matroids over tracts in two equivalent ways, which generalize both Baker-Bolwer theory and the parameterization of the Lagrangian Grassmannian. It provides a new perspective on the Lagrangian Grassmannian over hyperfields, especially, the tropical Lagrangian Grassmannian. Our proof involves a homotopy theorem for graphs associated with antisymmetric matroids, generalizing Maurer's homotopy theorem for matroids. We also prove that if a point in the projective space satisfies $3$-/$4$-term quadrics for the Lagrangian Grassmannian and its supports form the bases of an antisymmetric matroid, then it satisfies all quadrics, which is motivated by the earlier work of Tutte (1958) for matroids and linear spaces.</description>

      <title>Saturated Partial Embeddings of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study how far one can deviate from optimal behavior when embedding a planar graph. For a planar graph $G$, we say that a plane subgraph $H\subseteq G$ is a \textit{plane-saturated subgraph} if adding any edge (possibly with new vertices) to $H$ would either violate planarity or make the resulting graph no longer a subgraph of $G$. For a planar graph $G$, we define the \textit{plane-saturation ratio}, $\psr(G)$, as the minimum value of $\frac{e(H)}{e(G)}$ for a plane-saturated subgraph $H$ of $G$ and investigate how small $\psr(G)$ can be. While there exist planar graphs where $\psr(G)$ is arbitrarily close to $0$, we show that for all twin-free planar graphs, $\psr(G)&gt;1/16$, and that there exist twin-free planar graphs where $\psr(G)$ is arbitrarily close to $1/16$. In fact, we study a broader category of planar graphs, focusing on classes characterized by a bounded number of degree $1$ and degree $2$ twin vertices. We offer solutions for some instances of bounds while positing conjectures for the remaining ones.</description>

      <title>Binomial Coefficients and Littlewood--Richardson Coefficients for Interpolation Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous versions of Jack and Macdonald polynomials, called interpolation polynomials, have been introduced by Knop--Sahi (type $A$) and Okounkov (type $BC$). In this paper, we study binomial coefficients and Littlewood--Richardson (LR) coefficients for these interpolation polynomials. We extend to type $BC$ the weighted sum formula for binomial coefficients due to the second author in type $A$, and obtain a new weighted sum formula for LR coefficients for both types $A$ and $BC$. We prove that binomial coefficients are positive and monotone using the weighted sum formula and the combinatorial formulas due to Okounkov. As an application, we show that the containment partial order can be characterized in terms of Schur positivity or Jack positivity. This result is in parallel with the work of Cuttler--Greene--Skandera, Sra and Khare--Tao, which characterize two other partial orders, majorization and weak majorization, in terms of evaluation positivity of Schur functions.</description>

      <title>A Woven Klein Quartic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new method of weaving a model of the Klein quartic, a highly symmetric, but abstract genus-3 surface akin to a platonic polyhedron, with negatively-curved geometry. The Klein quartic cannot be realized in its fully symmetric form in three-dimensional space, but this model exhibits the most rigid symmetry that is possible. With remarkably little time and material you can have a Klein quartic of your own!</description>

      <title>The Ramsey numbers for trees of order $n$ with maximum degree at least $n-5$ versus the wheel graph of order nine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ramsey numbers $R(T_n,W_8)$ are determined for each tree graph $T_n$ of order $n\geq 7$ and maximum degree $\Delta(T_n)$ equal to either $n-4$ or $n-5$. These numbers indicate strong support for the conjecture, due to Chen, Zhang and Zhang and to Hafidh and Baskoro, that $R(T_n,W_m) = 2n-1$ for each tree graph $T_n$ of order $n\geq m-1$ with $\Delta(T_n)\leq n-m+2$ when $m\geq 4$ is even.</description>

      <title>On some path-critical Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For graphs $G$ and $H$, the Ramsey number $R(G,H)$ is the smallest $r$ such that any red-blue edge coloring of $K_r$ contains a red $G$ or a blue $H$. The path-critical Ramsey number $R_{\pi}(G,H)$ is the largest $n$ such that any red-blue edge coloring of $K_r \setminus P_{n}$ contains a red $G$ or a blue $H$, where $r=R(G,H)$ and $P_{n}$ is a path of order $n$. In this note, we show a general upper bound for $R_{\pi}(G,H)$, and determine the exact values for some cases of $R_{\pi}(G,H)$.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of the Corona of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The corona of hypergraphs is an extension of the corona operation applied to graphs. The corona $G_0^* \odot_1^n G_1^*$ of two hypergraphs is obtained by taking $n$ copies of $G_1^*$ (where $n$ is the order of $G_0^*$) and by joining the $i$-th vertex of $G_0^*$ with the $i$-th copy of $G_1^*$. In this paper, we estimate the complete spectrum(adjacency and Seidel) and eigenvectors of the corona $G_0^* \odot_1^n G_1^*$ of two hypergraphs when $G_1^*$ is regular. Additionally, we define the corona hypergraph $G_0^{*(m)}=G_0^{*(m-1)} \odot_1^n G_0^*$ and determined its adjacency spectrum. Also, we extend the definition coronal of the adjacency matrix. Moreover, we estimate the characteristic polynomial of Seidel matrix of the generalised corona of hypergraphs. Applying these results, we obtain infinitely many non-regular non-isomorphic adjacency and Seidel cospectral hypergraphs.</description>

Due to works of Meyerowitz, Mogilnykh and Valyuzenich, our result completes the classifications of completely regular codes with covering radius 1 and the second eigenvalue in the Hamming graphs H(n,q) for any n and completely regular codes with covering radius 1 in H(3,q).</description>

      <title>Face-hitting Dominating Sets in Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a subset $S$ of its vertices such that each vertex of $G$ not in $S$ has a neighbor in $S$. A face-hitting set of a plane graph $G$ is a set $T$ of vertices in $G$ such that every face of $G$ contains at least one vertex of $T$. We show that the vertex-set of every plane (multi-)graph without isolated vertices, self-loops or $2$-faces can be partitioned into two disjoint sets so that both the sets are dominating and face-hitting. We also show that all the three assumptions above are necessary for the conclusion.
  As a corollary, we show that every $n$-vertex simple plane triangulation has a dominating set of size at most $(1 - \alpha)n/2$, where $\alpha n$ is the maximum size of an independent set in the triangulation. Matheson and Tarjan [European J. Combin., 1996] conjectured that every plane triangulation with a sufficiently large number of vertices $n$ has a dominating set of size at most $n / 4$. Currently, the best known general bound for this is by Christiansen, Rotenberg and Rutschmann [SODA, 2024] who showed that every plane triangulation on $n &gt; 10$ vertices has a dominating set of size at most $2n/7$. Our corollary improves their bound for $n$-vertex plane triangulations which contain a maximal independent set of size either less than $2n/7$ or more than $3n/7$.</description>

      <title>E-injective coloring of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An injective coloring of a given graph G = (V, E) is a vertex coloring of G such that any two vertices with common neighbor receive distinct colors. An e-injective coloring of a graph G is a vertex coloring of G such that any two vertices with common edge neighbor receive distinct colors; in the other words, if u and v are the end of P4 = uxyv in a graph G, then u and v are assigned with different labels. We initiate the study of the concepts of the e-injective coloring for any graph. It is indicated, for any tree T , (other than star), the chromatic number of T and the e-injective chromatic number of T are same. We investigate an e-injective chromatic number of G versus of maximum degree of G and packing number of G. The e-injective chromatic number of union, join and Cartesian product of two graphs are studied. We determine the exact value for e-injective chromatic number of custom graphs. Finally we study the e-injective coloring of the Cartesian product of path Pn and cycle Cn with some specific graphs.</description>

      <title>Seymour's second neighbourhood conjecture: random graphs and reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding conjecture of Seymour states that in every oriented graph there is a vertex whose second outneighbourhood is at least as large as its outneighbourhood. In this short note we show that, for any fixed $p\in[0,1/2)$, a.a.s. every orientation of $G(n,p)$ satisfies Seymour's conjecture (as well as a related conjecture of Sullivan). This improves on a recent result of Botler, Moura and Naia. Moreover, we show that $p=1/2$ is a natural barrier for this problem, in the following sense: for any fixed $p\in(1/2,1)$, Seymour's conjecture is actually equivalent to saying that, with probability bounded away from $0$, every orientation of $G(n,p)$ satisfies Seymour's conjecture. This provides a first reduction of the problem.
  For a second reduction, we consider minimum degrees and show that, if Seymour's conjecture is false, then there must exist arbitrarily large strongly-connected counterexamples with bounded minimum outdegree. Contrasting this, we show that vertex-minimal counterexamples must have large minimum outdegree.</description>

      <title>A{\alpha}-spectral radius and path-factor covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha\in[0,1)$, and let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$ with $n\geq f(\alpha)$, where $f(\alpha)=14$ for $\alpha\in[0,\frac{1}{2}]$, $f(\alpha)=17$ for $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3}]$, $f(\alpha)=20$ for $\alpha\in(\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{4}]$ and $f(\alpha)=\frac{5}{1-\alpha}+1$ for $\alpha\in(\frac{3}{4},1)$. A path factor is a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that every component of $F$ is a path with at least two vertices. Let $k\geq2$ be an integer. A $P_{\geq k}$-factor means a path-factor with each component being a path of order at least $k$. A graph $G$ is called a $P_{\geq k}$-factor covered graph if $G$ has a $P_{\geq k}$-factor containing $e$ for any $e\in E(G)$. Let $A_{\alpha}(G)=\alpha D(G)+(1-\alpha)A(G)$, where $D(G)$ denotes the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees of $G$ and $A(G)$ denotes the adjacency matrix of $G$. The largest eigenvalue of $A_{\alpha}(G)$ is called the $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of $G$, which is denoted by $\rho_{\alpha}(G)$. In this paper, it is proved that $G$ is a $P_{\geq2}$-factor covered graph if $\rho_{\alpha}(G)&gt;\eta(n)$, where $\eta(n)$ is the largest root of $x^{3}-((\alpha+1)n+\alpha-4)x^{2}+(\alpha n^{2}+(\alpha^{2}-2\alpha-1)n-2\alpha+1)x-\alpha^{2}n^{2}+(5\alpha^{2}-3\alpha+2)n-10\alpha^{2}+15\alpha-8=0$. Furthermore, we provide a graph to show that the bound on $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius is optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that 1) the indicator function of some onefold or multifold independent set in a regular graph is a perfect coloring if and only if the set attain the Delsarte--Hoffman bound; 2) each transversal in a uniform regular hypergraph is an independent set attaining the Delsarte--Hoffman bound in the vertex adjacency multigraph of this hypergraph; 3) combinatorial designs with parameters $t$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ and similar $q$-designs, difference sets, Hadamard matrices, and bent functions are equivalent to perfect colorings of special graphs and multigraphs, in particular, it is true in the cases of the Johnson graphs $J(n,k)$ for $(k-1)$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ designs and the Grassmann graphs $J_2(n,2)$ for bent functions.

      <description>arXiv:2403.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the class of galled tree-child networks which is obtained as intersection of the classes of galled networks and tree-child networks. For the latter two classes, (asymptotic) counting results and stochastic results have been proved with very different methods. We show that a counting result for the class of galled tree-child networks follows with similar tools as used for galled networks, however, the result has a similar pattern as the one for tree-child networks. In addition, we also consider the (suitably scaled) numbers of reticulation nodes of random galled tree-child networks and show that they are asymptotically normal distributed. This is in contrast to the limit laws of the corresponding quantities for galled networks and tree-child networks which have been both shown to be discrete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a $k$-token signed graph and study some of its combinatorial and algebraic properties. We prove that two switching isomorphic signed graphs have switching isomorphic token graphs. Moreover, we show that the Laplacian spectrum of a balanced signed graph is contained in the Laplacian spectra of its $k$-token signed graph. Besides, we introduce and study the unbalance level of a signed graph, which is a new parameter that measures how far a signed graph is from being balanced. Moreover, we study the relation between the frustration index and the unbalance level of signed graphs and their token signed graphs.</description>

      <title>The clique chromatic number of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clique chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors in a vertex coloring so that no maximal clique is monochromatic. In this paper, we determine the order of magnitude of the clique chromatic number of the random graph G_{n,p} for most edge-probabilities p in the range n^{-2/5} \ll p \ll 1. This resolves open problems and questions of Lichev, Mitsche and Warnke as well as Alon and Krievelevich.
  One major proof difficulty stems from high-degree vertices, which prevent maximal cliques in their neighborhoods: we deal with these vertices by an intricate union bound argument, that combines the probabilistic method with new degree counting arguments in order to enable Janson's inequality. This way we determine the asymptotics of the clique chromatic number of G_{n,p} in some ranges, and discover a surprising new phenomenon that contradicts earlier predictions for edge-probabilities p close to n^{-2/5}.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the independence and chromatic numbers of locally sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider a more general version of local sparsity introduced recently by Anderson, Kuchukova, and the author. In particular, we say a graph $G = (V, E)$ is $(k, r)$-locally-sparse if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$, the subgraph induced by its neighborhood contains at most $k$ cliques of size $r$. For $r \geq 3$ and $\epsilon \in [0, 1]$, we show that a $(\Delta^{\epsilon r}, r)$-locally-sparse graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies $\alpha(G) = \Omega\left(\dfrac{n}{\gamma\Delta}\right)$ and $\chi(G) = O\left(\gamma\Delta\right)$, where $\gamma :=\max\left\{\epsilon,\,\dfrac{r\log\log \Delta}{\log \Delta}\right\}$. As $K_{r+1}$-free graphs are $(k, r)$-locally-sparse for any $k$, we asymptotically recover classical results of Shearer and Johansson by setting $\epsilon = 0$. We prove a stronger bound on the independence number in terms of the average degree, and establish a local version of the coloring result in the more general setting of correspondence coloring.</description>

      <title>On Projective Planes of Order 16 Associated with 1-rotational 2-(52, 4, 1) Designs</title>

Abstract: A maximal arc of degree k in a finite projective plane P of order q = ks is a set of (q-s+1)k points that meets every line of P in either k or 0 points. The collection of the nonempty intersections of a maximal arc with the lines of P is a resolvable Steiner 2-((q-s+1)k, k, 1) design. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a resolvable Steiner 2- design to be embeddable as a maximal arc in a projective plane were proved recently in [8]. Steiner designs associated with maximal arcs in the known projective planes of order 16 were analyzed in [6], where it was shown that some of the associated designs are embeddable in two non-isomorphic planes. Using MAGMA, we conducted an analysis to ascertain whether any of the 22 non-isomorphic 1-rotational 2-(52,4,1) designs, previously classified in [3], could be embedded in maximal arcs of degree 4 within projective planes of order 16. This paper presents a summary of our findings, revealing that precisely only one out of the the twenty-two 1-rotational designs from [3] is embeddable in a plane of order 16, being the Desarguesian plane P G(2, 16).</description>

      <title>Arctic curves of the T-system with Slanted Initial Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the T-system of type $A_\infty$, also known as the octahedron recurrence/equation, viewed as a 2+1-dimensional discrete evolution equation. Generalizing the study of [P. Di Francesco and R. Soto-Garrido. Arctic curves of the octahedron equation. J. Phys. A, 47(28):285204, 34, 2014], we consider initial data along parallel ``slanted" planes perpendicular to an arbitrary admissible direction $(r,s,t)\in {\mathbb Z}_+^3$. The solution of the T-system is interpreted as the partition function of a dimer model on some suitable ``pinecone" graph introduced in [M. Bousquet-M\'elou, J. Propp, and J. West. Perfect matchings for the three-term Gale-Robinson sequences. Electron. J. Combin., 16(1):Research Paper 125, 37, 2009]. The T-system formulation and some exact solutions in uniform or periodic cases allow us to explore the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding dimer models and to derive exact arctic curves separating the various phases of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give sharp bounds in Breuillard, Green and Tao's finitary version of Gromov's theorem on groups with polynomial growth. Precisely, we show that for every non-negative integer d there exists $c=c(d)&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is a group with finite symmetric generating set $S$ containing the identity and $|S^n|\le cn^{d+1}|S|$ for some positive integer $n$ then there exist normal subgroups $H\le\Gamma\le G$ such that $H\subseteq S^n$, such that $\Gamma/H$ is $d$-nilpotent (i.e. has a central series of length $d$ with cyclic factors), and such that $[G:\Gamma]\le g(d)$, where $g(d)$ denotes the maximum order of a finite subgroup of $GL_d(\mathbb{Z})$. The bounds on both the nilpotence and index are sharp; the previous best bounds were $O(d)$ on the nilpotence, and an ineffective function of $d$ on the index. In fact, we obtain this as a small part of a much more detailed fine-scale description of the structure of $G$. These results have a wide range of applications in various aspects of the theory of vertex-transitive graphs: percolation theory, random walks, structure of finite groups, scaling limits of finite vertex-transitive graphs.... We obtain some of these applications in the present paper, and treat others in companion papers. Some are due to or joint with other authors.</description>

      <title>Counting lattice points that appear as algebraic invariants of Cameron-Walker graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2021, Hibi et. al. studied lattice points in $\mathbb{N}^2$ that appear as $(\depth R/I,\dim R/I)$ when $I$ is the edge ideal of a graph on $n$ vertices, and showed these points lie between two convex polytopes. When restricting to the class of Cameron--Walker graphs, they showed that these pairs do not form a convex lattice polytope. In this paper, for the edge ideal $I$ of a Cameron--Walker graph on $n$ vertices, we find how many points in $\mathbb{N}^2$ appear as $(\depth(R/I),\dim(R/I))$, and how many points in $\mathbb{N}^4$ appear as $(\depth(R/I),\reg(R/I),\dim(R/I),\degh(R/I)).$</description>

      <title>Eight-Partitioning Points in 3D, and Efficiently Too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An \emph{eight-partition} of a finite set of points (respectively, of a continuous mass distribution) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of three planes that divide the space into $8$ octants, such that each open octant contains at most $1/8$ of the points (respectively, of the mass). In 1966, Hadwiger showed that any mass distribution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition; moreover, one can prescribe the normal direction of one of the three planes. The analogous result for finite point sets follows by a standard limit argument.
  We prove the following variant of this result: Any mass distribution (or point set) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition for which the intersection of two of the planes is a line with a prescribed direction.
  Moreover, we present an efficient algorithm for calculating an eight-partition of a set of $n$ points in~$\mathbb{R}^3$ (with prescribed normal direction of one of the planes) in time $O^{*}(n^{5/2})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider $n$ independent random numbers with a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. The number of them that exceed their mean is shown to have an Eulerian distribution, i.e., it is described by the Eulerian numbers. This is related to, but distinct from, the well known fact that the integer part of the sum of independent random numbers uniform on $[0,1]$ has an Eulerian distribution. One motivation for this problem comes from voting theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary search trees (BST) are a popular type of data structure when dealing with ordered data. Indeed, they enable one to access and modify data efficiently, with their height corresponding to the worst retrieval time. From a probabilistic point of view, binary search trees associated with data arriving in a uniform random order are well understood, but less is known when the input is a non-uniform random permutation. We consider here the case where the input comes from i.i.d. random points in the plane with law $\mu$, a model which we refer to as a permuton sample. Our results show that the asymptotic proportion of nodes in each subtree depends on the behavior of the measure $\mu$ at its left boundary, while the height of the BST has a universal asymptotic behavior for a large family of measures $\mu$. Our approach involves a mix of combinatorial and probabilistic tools, namely combinatorial properties of binary search trees, coupling arguments, and deviation estimates.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square shape computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitely defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

      <title>Reducing Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture to Coloring Small Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01633v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $(t-1)$-colorable for every $t\ge 1$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason independently proved that every graph with no $K_t$ minor has average degree $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$ and hence is $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$-colorable. Recently, Norin, Song and the second author showed that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t(\log t)^{\beta})$-colorable for every $\beta &gt; 1/4$, making the first improvement on the order of magnitude of the $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$ bound. The first main result of this paper is that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t\log\log t)$-colorable.
  This is a corollary of our main technical result that the chromatic number of a $K_t$-minor-free graph is bounded by $O(t(1+f(G,t)))$ where $f(G,t)$ is the maximum of $\frac{\chi(H)}{a}$ over all $a\ge \frac{t}{\sqrt{\log t}}$ and $K_a$-minor-free subgraphs $H$ of $G$ that are small (i.e. $O(a\log^4 a)$ vertices). This has a number of interesting corollaries. First as mentioned, using the current best-known bounds on coloring small $K_t$-minor-free graphs, we show that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t\log\log t)$-colorable. Second, it shows that proving Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture (that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t)$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Third, we prove that $K_t$-minor-free graphs with clique number at most $\sqrt{\log t}/ (\log \log t)^2$ are $O(t)$-colorable. This implies our final corollary that Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for $K_r$-free graphs for every fixed $r$.
  One key to proving the main theorem is a new standalone result that every $K_t$-minor-free graph of average degree $d=\Omega(t)$ has a subgraph on $O(t \log^3 t)$ vertices with average degree $\Omega(d)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate extreme values of Mahonian and Eulerian distributions arising from counting inversions and descents of random elements of finite Coxeter groups. To this end, we construct a triangular array of either distribution from a sequence of Coxeter groups with increasing ranks. To avoid degeneracy of extreme values, the number of i.i.d. samples $k_n$ in each row must be asymptotically bounded. We employ large deviations theory to prove the Gumbel attraction of Mahonian and Eulerian distributions. It is shown that for the two classes, different bounds on $k_n$ ensure this.</description>

Abstract: In 2016, Nath and Sellers proposed a conjecture regarding the precise largest size of ${(s,ms-1,ms+1)}$-core partitions. In this paper, we prove their conjecture. One of the key techniques in our proof is to introduce and study the properties of generalized-$\beta$-sets, which extend the concept of $\beta$-sets for core partitions. Our results can be interpreted as a generalization of the well-known result of Yang, Zhong, and Zhou concerning the largest size of $(s,s+1,s+2)$-core partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that Paley graphs of square order have the strict-EKR property, that is, all maximum cliques are canonical cliques. Peisert-type graphs are natural generalizations of Paley graphs and some of them also have the strict-EKR property. Given a prime power $q \geq 3$, we study Peisert-type graphs of order $q^2$ without the strict-EKR property and with the minimum number of edges and we call such graphs extremal. We determine number of edges in extremal graphs for each value of $q$. If $q$ is a a square or a cube, we show the uniqueness of the extremal graph and classify all maximum cliques explicitly. Moreover, when $q$ is a square, we prove that there is no Hilton-Milner type result for the extremal graph, and show the tightness of the weight-distribution bound for both non-principal eigenvalues of this graph.</description>

Abstract: The adjacency operator of a graph has a spectrum and a class of scalar-valued spectral measures which have been systematically analyzed; it also has a spectral multiplicity function which has been less studied. The first purpose of this article is to review some examples of infinite graphs for which the spectral multiplicity function of the adjacency operator has been determined. The second purpose of this article is to show explicit examples of infinite connected graphs which are cospectral, i.e., which have unitarily equivalent adjacency operators, and explicit examples of infinite connected graphs which are uniquely determined by their spectrum.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the saturation number and a strengthening for triangle-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The saturation number $\operatorname{sat}(n, H)$ of a graph $H$ and positive integer $n$ is the minimum size of an $n$-vertex graph which does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to $H$ but to which the addition of any edge creates such a subgraph. Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Moon first studied saturation numbers of complete graphs, and Cameron and Puleo introduced a general lower bound on $\operatorname{sat}(n,H)$. In this paper, we present another lower bound on $\operatorname{sat}(n, H)$ with a strengthening when $H$ is triangle-free. Demonstrating its effectiveness, we determine the saturation numbers of diameter-$3$ trees up to an additive constant; these are double stars $S_{s,t}$ on $s + t$ vertices whose centers have degrees $s$ and $t$. Faudree, Faudree, Gould, and Jacobson determined that $\operatorname{sat}(n, S_{t,t}) = (t-1)n/2 + O(1)$. We show that $\operatorname{sat}(n,S_{s,t}) = (st+s)n/(2t+4) + O(1)$ when $s &lt; t$. We also determine lower and upper bounds on the saturation numbers of certain diameter-$4$ caterpillars.</description>

Abstract: Two formulas for the classical number $C_n$ of lines on a generic hypersurface of degree $2n-3$ in $\mathbb{CP}^n$ are obtained which differ from the formulas by Dominici, Harris, Libgober, and van der Waerden-Zagier. We review the splitting principle computation by Harris obtaining a similar general closed-form formula in terms of the Catalan numbers and elementary symmetric polynomials. This in turn yields $C_n$ as a linear difference recursion relation of unbounded order. Thus, for the sequence of certain linear combinations of $C_n$, a simple generating function is found. Then, a result from random algebraic geometry by Basu, Lerario, Lundberg, and Peterson, that expresses these classical enumerative invariants as proportional to the Bombieri norm of particular polynomial determinants, yields another combinatorial expansion in terms of certain set compositions and block labeling counting. As an example, we compute this combinatorial interpretation for the cases of 27 lines on a cubic surface and 2875 lines on a quintic threefold. As an application, we reobtain the parity and asymptotic upper bound of the sequence. In an appendix, we generalize the splitting principle calculation to obtain a formula for the number of lines on a generic complete intersection.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic concavity of bimatroids</title>

Abstract: A bimatroid is a matroid-like generalization of the collection of regular minors of a matrix. In this article, we use the theory of Lorentzian polynomials to study the logarithmic concavity of natural sequences associated to bimatroids. Bimatroids can be used to characterize morphisms of matroids and this observation (originally due to Kung) allows us to prove a weak version of logarithmic concavity of the number of bases of a morphism of matroids. This is weaker than the original result by Eur and Huh; it nevertheless provides us with a new perspective on Mason's log-concavity conjecture for independent sets of matroids. We finally show that for realizable bimatroids, the regular minor polynomial is a volume polynomial. Applied to morphisms of matroids, this shows that the weak basis generating polynomial of a morphism is a volume polynomial; this confirms a conjecture of Eur--Huh for morphisms of nullity $\leq 1$ and gives an algebro-geometric explanation for Mason's log-concavity conjecture in the realizable case.</description>

      <title>Stability of graph pairs involving cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph pair $(\Gamma, \Sigma)$ is called stable if $\aut(\Gamma)\times\aut(\Sigma)$ is isomorphic to $\aut(\Gamma\times\Sigma)$ and unstable otherwise, where $\Gamma\times\Sigma$ is the direct product of $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$. A graph is called $R$-thin if distinct vertices have different neighbourhoods. $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are said to be coprime if there is no nontrivial graph $\Delta$ such that $\Gamma \cong \Gamma_1 \times \Delta$ and $\Sigma \cong \Sigma_1 \times \Delta$ for some graphs $\Gamma_1$ and $\Sigma_1$. An unstable graph pair $(\Gamma, \Sigma)$ is called nontrivially unstable if $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are $R$-thin connected coprime graphs and at least one of them is non-bipartite. This paper contributes to the study of the stability of graph pairs with a focus on the case when $\Sigma = C_n$ is a cycle. We give two sufficient conditions for $(\Gamma, C_n)$ to be nontrivially unstable, where $n \ne 4$ and $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected graph. In the case when $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected non-bipartite graph, we obtain the following results: (i) if $(\Gamma, K_2)$ is unstable, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is unstable for every even integer $n \geq 4$; (ii) if an even integer $n \ge 6$ is compatible with $\Gamma$ in some sense, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is nontrivially unstable if and only if $(\Gamma, K_2)$ is unstable; (iii) if there is an even integer $n \ge 6$ compatible with $\Gamma$ such that $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is nontrivially unstable, then $(\Gamma, C_{m})$ is unstable for all even integers $m \ge 6$. We also prove that if $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected graph and $n \ge 3$ is an odd integer compatible with $\Gamma$, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is stable.</description>

      <title>Decidability for Sturmian words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08207v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the first-order theory of Sturmian words over Presburger arithmetic is decidable. Using a general adder recognizing addition in Ostrowski numeration systems by Baranwal, Schaeffer and Shallit, we prove that the first-order expansions of Presburger arithmetic by a single Sturmian word are uniformly $\omega$-automatic, and then deduce the decidability of the theory of the class of such structures. Using an implementation of this decision algorithm called Pecan, we automatically reprove classical theorems about Sturmian words in seconds, and are able to obtain new results about antisquares and antipalindromes in characteristic Sturmian words.</description>

      <title>Improved Shortest Path Restoration Lemmas for Multiple Edge Failures: Trade-offs Between Fault-tolerance and Subpaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The restoration lemma is a classic result by Afek, Bremler-Barr, Kaplan, Cohen, and Merritt [PODC '01], which relates the structure of shortest paths in a graph $G$ before and after some edges in the graph fail. Their work shows that, after one edge failure, any replacement shortest path avoiding this failing edge can be partitioned into two pre-failure shortest paths. More generally, this implies an additive tradeoff between fault tolerance and subpath count: for any $f, k$, we can partition any $f$-edge-failure replacement shortest path into $k+1$ subpaths which are each an $(f-k)$-edge-failure replacement shortest path. This generalized result has found applications in routing, graph algorithms, fault tolerant network design, and more.
  Our main result improves this to a multiplicative tradeoff between fault tolerance and subpath count. We show that for all $f, k$, any $f$-edge-failure replacement path can be partitioned into $O(k)$ subpaths that are each an $(f/k)$-edge-failure replacement path. We also show an asymptotically matching lower bound. In particular, our results imply that the original restoration lemma is exactly tight in the case $k=1$, but can be significantly improved for larger $k$. We also show an extension of this result to weighted input graphs, and we give efficient algorithms that compute path decompositions satisfying our improved restoration lemmas.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles have the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$ defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$ is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$ and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in zero-error function computation with side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice has a source $X$ and Bob has correlated source $Y$ and they can communicate via either classical or a quantum channel. Bob wants to calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. We aim to characterize the minimum amount of information that Alice needs to send to Bob for this to happen with zero-error. In the classical setting, this quantity depends on the asymptotic growth of $\chi(G^{(m)})$, the chromatic number of an appropriately defined $m$-instance "confusion graph". In this work we present structural characterizations of $G^{(m)}$ and demonstrate two function computation scenarios that have the same single-instance confusion graph. However, in one case there a strict advantage in using quantum transmission as against classical transmission, whereas there is no such advantage in the other case.</description>

      <title>Cluster deep loci and mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine cluster varieties are covered up to codimension 2 by open algebraic tori. We put forth a general conjecture (based on earlier conversation between Vivek Shende and the last author) characterizing their deep locus, i.e. the complement of all cluster charts, as the locus of points with non-trivial stabilizer under the action of cluster automorphisms. We use the diagrammatics of Demazure weaves to verify the conjecture for skew-symmetric cluster varieties of finite cluster type with arbitrary choice of frozens and for the top open positroid strata of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,n)$ and $\mathrm{Gr}(3,n)$. We illustrate how this already has applications in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry, by proving that the Fukaya category of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,2n+1)$ is split-generated by finitely many Lagrangian tori, and homological mirror symmetry holds with a Landau--Ginzburg model proposed by Rietsch. Finally, we study the geometry of the deep locus, and find that it can be singular and have several irreducible components of different dimensions, but they all are again cluster varieties in our examples in really full rank cases.</description>

      <title>The Honest Embedding Dimension of a Numerical Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attached to a singular analytic curve germ in $d$-space is a numerical semigroup: a subset $S$ of the non-negative integers which is closed under addition and whose complement isfinite. Conversely, associated to any numerical semigroup $S$ is a canonical mononial curve in $e$-space where $e$ is the number of minimal generators of the semigroup. It may happen that $d &lt; e = e(S)$ where $S$ is the semigroup of the curve in $d$-space. Define the minimal (or `honest') embedding of a numerical semigroup to be the smallest $d$ such that $S$ is realized by a curve in $d$-space. Problem: characterize the numerical semigroups having minimal embedding dimension $d$. The answer is known for the case $d=2$ of planar curves and reviewed in an Appendix to this paper. The case $d =3$ of the problem is open. Our main result is a characterization of the multiplicity $4$ numerical semigroups whose minimal embedding dimension is $3$. See figure 1. The motivation for this work came from thinking about Legendrian curve singularities.</description>

      <title>A Strongly Subcubic Combinatorial Algorithm for Triangle Detection with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the algorithmic problem of finding a triangle in a graph: We give a randomized combinatorial algorithm for triangle detection in a given $n$-vertex graph with $m$ edges running in $O(n^{7/3})$ time, or alternatively in $O(m^{4/3})$ time. This may come as a surprise since it invalidates several conjectures in the literature. In particular,
  - the $O(n^{7/3})$ runtime surpasses the long-standing fastest algorithm for triangle detection based on matrix multiplication running in $O(n^\omega) = O(n^{2.372})$ time, due to Itai and Rodeh (1978).
  - the $O(m^{4/3})$ runtime surpasses the long-standing fastest algorithm for triangle detection in sparse graphs based on matrix multiplication running in $O(m^{2\omega/(\omega+1)})= O(m^{1.407})$ time due to Alon, Yuster, and Zwick (1997).
  - the $O(n^{7/3})$ time algorithm for triangle detection leads to a $O(n^{25/9} \log{n})$ time combinatorial algorithm for $n \times n$ Boolean matrix multiplication, by a reduction of V. V. Williams and R.~R.~Williams (2018).This invalidates a conjecture of A.~Abboud and V. V. Williams (FOCS 2014).
  - the $O(m^{4/3})$ runtime invalidates a conjecture of A.~Abboud and V. V. Williams (FOCS 2014) that any combinatorial algorithm for triangle detection requires $m^{3/2 -o(1)}$ time.
  - as a direct application of the triangle detection algorithm, we obtain a faster exact algorithm for the $k$-clique problem, surpassing an almost $40$ years old algorithm of Ne{\v{s}}et{\v{r}}il and Poljak (1985). This result strongly disproves the combinatorial $k$-clique conjecture.
  - as another direct application of the triangle detection algorithm, we obtain a faster exact algorithm for the \textsc{Max-Cut} problem, surpassing an almost $20$ years old algorithm of R.~R.~Williams (2005).</description>
