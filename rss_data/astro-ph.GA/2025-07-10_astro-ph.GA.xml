      <title>Before its time: a remarkably evolved protocluster core at z=7.88</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoclusters represent the most extreme environments in the very early Universe. They form from large-scale dark matter overdensities, harbouring an overabundance of galaxies fed by large gas reservoirs. Their early and accelerated evolution results in a distinct difference in the properties of galaxies resident in protoclusters versus the field, which is known to be in place by $z\sim 5-6$. We utilise JWST NIRCam observations of the A2744-z7p9OD protocluster at $z=7.88$ to constrain the properties of resident galaxies. We identify seven new protocluster members, bringing the total number to 23 and the total stellar mass of the protocluster to in excess of $10^{10}\ \rm{M_{\odot}}$. These galaxies are remarkably evolved just 650 Myr after the Big Bang, preferentially showing redder UV-slopes and stronger Balmer breaks than is typical of field galaxies. We use the PROSPECTOR spectral energy distribution fitting code to derive key galaxy properties, finding distinct populations in the core versus the outskirts of the protocluster. The core is largely composed of dusty, massive galaxies which can be characterised as undergoing a synchronised (mini)-quenched phase, while galaxies in the protocluster outskirts are undergoing recent bursts of star formation. Finally, a strong suppression of the continuum around the Ly$\alpha$-break evidences extreme neutral hydrogen column densities in many resident galaxies ($N_{\rm HI}\gtrsim10^{23}\ {\rm cm^{-2}}$). The A2744-z7p9OD system is the most extreme, evolved overdensity yet observed at $z&gt;7$, with higher stellar masses, gas densities, and dust attenuation, revealing the intersection of local environment and high-redshift galaxy formation at their extremes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cosmic Dawn with PANORAMIC I: The Bright End of the UVLF at $z\sim9 -17$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In its first two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope has enabled the discovery of a surprising number of UV-bright galaxies at $z\sim10-14$. Their number density is still relatively uncertain, due to cosmic variance effects, and the limited survey area with deep imaging. Here, we combine pure parallel imaging from the PANORAMIC survey with data from legacy fields to constrain the bright end (M$_{\rm UV}&lt;-18.5$) of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) over $0.28\,$deg$^2$ of NIRCam imaging in 6 or more filters, and along 35 independent lines of sight. Using conservative color selections, we compile robust dropout samples at $z\sim10$, $z\sim13$, and $z\sim17$, and identify 16 new candidates from PANORAMIC. Our inferred UVLFs at $z\sim10$ are consistent with literature results and we confirm the high abundance of galaxies at the bright end (M$_{\rm UV}\lesssim-21$) with better number statistics. We find somewhat lower number densities at $z\sim13$ compared to previous studies, and no robust candidates at $z\sim17$, indicating a rapid evolution of the galaxy population from $z\sim10-17$. The improved upper limits at $z\sim17$ imply that the cosmic UV luminosity density drops by at least a factor $\sim50$ from $z\sim10$ to $z\sim17$. Comparing our results to models proposed to explain the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, we conclude that a modest increase in the star formation efficiency, or in the burstiness of star formation, a more top-heavy initial mass function, a lack of dust attenuation, or a combination of these effects at $z\gtrsim10$, is sufficient to match our observational constraints.</description>

      <title>A three-step approach to reliably estimate magnetic field strengths in star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field is known to play a crucial role in star formation. Dust polarization is an effective tool for probing the morphology of the field, yet it does not directly trace its strength. Several methods have been developed, combining polarization and spectroscopic data, to estimate the strength of the magnetic field, including the DCF method, which relates these quantities to the magnetic-field strength under the assumption of Alfv\'enic turbulence. Skalidis &amp; Tassis (2021) (ST), relaxed this assumption to account for the compressible modes, deriving more accurate estimates of the field strength. We evaluate the accuracy of these methods in star-forming regions and propose a systematic approach for calculating the key observational parameters involved: the velocity dispersion (dv), the dispersion of polarization angles (d\theta), and the cloud density (rho). We use a 3D MHD chemodynamical simulation of a turbulent molecular cloud and generate synthetic observations, for seven different inclination angles. We employ various approaches for estimating the parameters dv, d\theta, and rho and find that the approach used to calculate these parameters plays a crucial role in estimating the magnetic field strength. We show that the value probed by both the DCF and ST methods corresponds to the median of the molecular-species-weighted POS component of the magnetic field. The ST outperforms DCF, accurately following the expected cosine trend with respect to the inclination angle, and remains within 1\sigma from the true strength of the field. Based on our analysis, we proposed that, in self-gravitating clouds, the intrinsic parameters (rho, dv, d\theta) should be calculated as follows: rho using radiative transfer analysis, dv using the second moment maps, and d\theta by fitting Gaussians to the polarization angle distributions to remove the contribution of the hourglass morphology.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Improves Photometric Redshifts in All Regions of Color Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$'s) are crucial for the cosmology, galaxy evolution, and transient science drivers of next-generation imaging facilities like the Euclid Mission, the Rubin Observatory, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Previous work has shown that image-based deep learning photo-$z$ methods produce smaller scatter than photometry-based classical machine learning (ML) methods on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main Galaxy Sample, a testbed photo-$z$ dataset. However, global assessments can obscure local trends. To explore this possibility, we used a self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster SDSS galaxies based on their $ugriz$ colors. Deep learning methods achieve lower photo-$z$ scatter than classical ML methods for all SOM cells. The fractional reduction in scatter is roughly constant across most of color space with the exception of the most bulge-dominated and reddest cells where it is smaller in magnitude. Interestingly, classical ML photo-$z$'s suffer from a significant color-dependent attenuation bias, where photo-$z$'s for galaxies within a SOM cell are systematically biased towards the cell's mean spectroscopic redshift and away from extreme values, which is not readily apparent when all objects are considered. In contrast, deep learning photo-$z$'s suffer from very little color-dependent attenuation bias. The increased attenuation bias for classical ML photo-$z$ methods is the primary reason why they exhibit larger scatter than deep learning methods. This difference can be explained by the deep learning methods weighting redshift information from the individual pixels of a galaxy image more optimally than integrated photometry.</description>

      <title>Introducing NewCluster: the first half of the history of a high-resolution cluster simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NewCluster, a new high-resolution cluster simulation designed to serve as the massive halo counterpart of the modern cosmological galaxy evolution framework. The zoom-in simulation targets a volume of $4.1\sigma$ overdensity region, which is expected to evolve into a galaxy cluster with a virial mass of $5 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$, comparable to that of the Virgo Cluster. The zoom-in volume extends out to 3.5 virial radii from the central halo. The novelties of NewCluster are found in its resolutions. Its stellar mass resolution of $2 \times 10^{4} M_\odot$ is effective for tracing the early assembly of massive galaxies as well as the formation of dwarf galaxies. The spatial resolution of 68 parsecs in the best-resolved regions in the adaptive-mesh-refinement approach is powerful to study the detailed kinematic structure of galaxies. The time interval between snapshots is also exceptionally short-15 Myr-which is ideal for monitoring changes in the physical properties of galaxies, particularly during their orbital motion within a larger halo. The simulation has up-to-date feedback schemes for supernovae and active galactic nuclei. The chemical evolution is calculated for ten elements, along with dust calculation that includes the formation, size change, and destruction. To overcome the limitations of the Eulerian approach used for gas dynamics in this study, we employ Monte Carlo-based tracer particles in NewCluster, enabling a wide range of scientific investigations.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Optical IFU Spectroscopy of the Complex Galaxy Merger II Zw 096</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous and Ultra-luminous IR galaxies ((U)LIRGs) are critical for investigating feedback mechanisms due to a combination of intense star formation (SF) episodes and active galactic nuclei (AGN), particularly in the context of complex galaxy interactions. We conduct a detailed analysis of the II ZW 096 merging system using the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), combining high-resolution Narrow Field Mode (NFM) and large-area Wide Field Mode (WFM) observations. We mapped the morphology, kinematics, and ionizing radiation of the system's gas by fitting atomic emission lines and the optical continuum. We identify three or more distinct galaxies within II ZW 096, revealing rotational patterns and complex interactions consistent with a collapsing small galaxy group. The kinematics and ionization structures suggest high star formation rates and shock-driven processes, which align with this proposed scenario. Focusing on the D1 compact region, which contributes 40-70% of the system's IR emission, and combining information from archival multi-wavelength observations, we find strong evidence of a heavily obscured AGN powering it. Our analysis of the internal structure, interactions, and merger state of II ZW 096 offers novel insights into the galaxy evolution processes in this dynamic and highly chaotic system</description>

      <title>Parsec-scale SiO emission in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central 5 parsecs of our Galactic Center is rich in various molecular tracers. The region is observed to be hot, highly ionized, and volatile, resulting in complex chemistry and kinematics. Countless molecular observations of the central region orbiting the central super-massive black hole Sgr A* have revealed a stable grouping of clouds with a disk-like structure known as the circumnuclear disk (CND) orbiting Sgr A* between 1.5 and 3 pc. The CND houses the densest population of gas outside the ionized streams in the minispiral falling onto Sgr A*. However, the small-scale kinematics of the clouds and gas are poorly understood in this region. In this paper, we report single dish SiO (1-0) observations of the central 5 pc surrounding Sgr A* taken with the Green Bank Telescope. Most of the SiO (1-0) traces the southern streamer and Sgr A East-neither of which are associated with the CND. However, one region in the CND, known as the NE Arm, shows high-intensity SiO emission unlike in the rest of the CND, indicating the NE Arm as a candidate region of either cloud-cloud collision or early star formation. Further high resolution observations of the region are needed to distinguish between the two scenarios.</description>

      <title>The EDGE-CALIFA Survey: An integral field unit-based integrated molecular gas database for galaxy evolution studies in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying galaxy evolution requires knowledge not only of the stellar properties, but also of the interstellar medium (in particular the molecular phase) out of which stars form, using a statistically significant and unbiased sample of galaxies. To this end, we introduce here the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), a collection of integrated stellar and nebular emission lines, and molecular gas properties from 643 galaxies in the local Universe. These galaxies are drawn from the CALIFA datasets, and are followed up in CO lines by the APEX, CARMA, and ACA telescopes. As this database is assembled from data coming from a heterogeneous set of telescopes (including IFU optical data and single-dish and interferometric CO data), we adopted a series of techniques (tapering, spatial and spectral smoothing, and aperture correction) to homogenise the data. Due to the application of these techniques, the database contains measurements from the inner regions of the galaxies and for the full galaxy extent. We used the database to study the fundamental star formation relationships between star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_*$), and molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) across galaxies with different morphologies. We observed that the diagrams defined by these quantities are bi-modal, with early-type passive objects well separated from spiral star-forming galaxies. Additionally, while the molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm mol}=M_{\rm mol}/M_*$) decreases homogeneously across these two types of galaxies, the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/$M_{\rm mol}$) in the inner regions of passive galaxies is almost two orders of magnitude lower compared to the global values. This indicates that inside-out quenching requires not only low $f_{\rm mol}$, but also strongly reduced SFE in the galactic centres.</description>

      <title>The EDGE-CALIFA survey: Star formation relationships for galaxies at different stages of their evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution is largely driven by star formation activity or by the cessation of it, also called star formation quenching. In this paper, we present star formation scaling relations for galaxies at different evolutionary stages. To do so, we used the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), which collects CO, optical continuum, and emission line information for 643 galaxies from the CALIFA IFU dataset. By considering the patterns described by star-forming and retired regions, we grouped the galaxies into quenching stages using the emission line classification scheme, QueStNA. We observed that the molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) decreases from star-forming to retired systems and so does the molecular-to-stellar mass ratio ($f_{\rm mol}$). In contrast, star formation efficiency (SFE) is constant in the quenching stages dominated by star formation and rapidly declines afterwards. We observed that this rapid decline is more pronounced in the centre of the galaxies compared to the rest of the discs, reflecting the inside-out quenching displayed by nearby galaxies. We noticed that the relations between $M_{\rm mol}$ and the stellar mass ($M_*$) become increasingly shallow with the quenching stages; however, the relations between the star formation rate (SFR) and $M_{\rm mol}$ steepen when going from star-forming to retired systems. We observed that a three-dimensional relation between SFR, $M_*$, and $M_{\rm mol}$ exists for star-forming galaxies, while data points from other quenching groups are scattered across the parameter space. Taken together, these pieces of evidence indicate that the quenching of the galaxies cannot be explained solely by a depletion of the molecular gas and that a significant decrease in the SFE is necessary to retire the centre of the galaxies beyond the star formation green valley.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic Medium Tomography with the Sunburst Arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing has transformed the field of gas tomography in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM). Here we use the brightest lensed galaxy identified to date, the Sunburst Arc ($z$$\approx$2.37), to constrain the physical size of foreground absorbers at $z$$\approx$2 in 2D. This galaxy is a confirmed Lyman continuum leaker, where its single leaking region is imaged 12 times over four separate arcs. The separations between the arcs allows for large scale tomography, while the distances between the images along an arc allow for small scale tomography. Using HST/WFC3 UVIS G280 grism observations, we extracted the spectra of the leaking region and fit for absorbers detected along these lines of sight using a binary population and spectral synthesis (BPASS) model for the galaxy. We identified two partial Lyman limit systems (pLLSs) and one Lyman limit system (LLS) across the different spectra and measured their physical sizes. We find consistent HI column densities across $\lesssim$2 kpc and an average HI mass of $\approx$10$^3$ ${\rm M}_\odot$ for the absorbers. Given the strong CIV lines associated with two of the absorbers, they are likely located within the CGM of foreground galaxies. The third absorber has no associated metal lines, so it is most likely within the IGM. This study provides the first tomography measurements of pLLSs/LLSs in the CGM and IGM at $z$$\approx$2.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Analysis of the Milky Way Warp Based on Classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (CCs) are important probes for the large-scale warp structure of the Milky Way. Using Gaia DR3 CCs, we establish an optimal time-dependent warp model, where the warp height increases with radius following a power-law, the line of nodes (LONs) exhibit linear twisting with radius, following a leading spiral pattern, and the LONs undergo prograde evolution over time. Structurally, we identify significant warp features in the $5-9$ kpc region of the Galactic disk, where the warp model performs better than the flat model. Beyond 15 kpc, the model with the second Fourier term does not fit the observations well, whereas the model with twisted LONs better matches the data. Kinematically, we derived expressions for the vertical velocities using direct differentiation and then calculated the precession rates for each CC. Our results intuitively indicate a nearly uniform and low warp precession rate of $\omega = 4.86 \pm (0.88)_{stat} \pm (2.14)_{sys}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ beyond 12.5 kpc, in agreement with classical kinematic estimates. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet comprehensive time-dependent warp model, $Z_{w}(t) = 0.00019R^{3.08}\sin(\phi - (3.87R-41.79 + 4.86t))$, which provides a unified framework for describing both the geometric and kinematic evolution of the Galactic warp. We analyzed the impact of the adopted solar vertical velocity on the inferred warp precession rate and confirmed the reliability of the measured precession rate. In addition, we found that extinction treatment affects the warp amplitude in the inner disk, while its influence on the outer disk warp structure and the precession rate is negligible.</description>

      <title>The Distribution of Atomic Hydrogen in the Host Galaxies of FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06594v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the atomic hydrogen (HI) emission from the host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to investigate the emerging trend of disturbance and asymmetry in the population. Quadrupling the sample size, we detect 13 of 14 new hosts in HI, with the only non-detection arising in a galaxy known to be transitioning towards quiescence. With respect to typical local Universe galaxies, FRB hosts are generally massive in HI ($M_{HI}&gt;10^9 M_\odot$), which aligns with previous studies showing that FRB hosts also tend to have high stellar masses and are star-forming. However, they span a broad range of other HI derived properties. In our independent sample of repeater hosts, we observe a statistically insignificant preference towards lower HI masses compared to non-repeater hosts, similar to the low-significance trend toward lower stellar masses previously reported. Using visual inspection alongside various asymmetry metrics, we identify four unambiguously settled host galaxies, demonstrating for the first time that a disturbed HI morphology is not a universal feature of FRB host galaxies. However, we find another six that show clear signs of disturbance, and three which require deeper, more targeted observations to reach a conclusion; this brings the confirmed ratio of disturbed-to-settled FRB hosts to 11:4. Given that roughly a 1:1 ratio is expected for random background galaxies of similar type, our observed ratio yields a p-value of 0.065. Unlike earlier indications based on smaller samples, this no longer crosses the conventional threshold for statistical significance, though is still near enough to hint at a legitimate excess of disturbance among FRB hosts. Thus, an even larger sample size of FRB hosts observed in HI is required to fully clarify whether the trend is genuine or still a consequence of low-number statistics - a sample that upcoming data releases are well positioned to provide.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Isomers of C$_{11}$H$_9^+$: New Experimental Insights from the PIRENEA Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dehydrogenated cation of methylated benzene is known to exist in two isomeric forms: benzylium and tropylium. Structurally similar forms have been proposed for the -H cations of methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but their spectroscopic characterization remains limited, and their photophysical properties are still poorly understood. Previous studies identified 2-naphthylmethylium and benzyltropylium as specific long-lived isomers of the -H fragment of methylnaphthalene cations. Here, we investigate the photodissociation spectroscopy and photoprocessing of gas-phase C$_{11}$H$_9^+$ ions in the visible range. Experiments are conducted using the versatile laboratory astrophysics setup PIRENEA, which enables studies over long timescales ($\sim$1000 s) and allows photoprocessing to be combined with ion-molecule reaction experiments. We confirm the presence of 2-naphthylmethylium and benzyltropylium and additionally identify 1-naphthylmethylium, previously undetected in experiments. Moreover, we present the first complete quantitative analysis of the relative abundances of these isomers and provide clear evidence of interconversion among the three long-lived species. These isomerization processes occur below the dissociation threshold, a finding supported by molecular dynamics simulations. The photophysical properties of C$_{11}$H$_9^+$ isomers -- including isomerization and fluorescence -- make them intriguing candidates for consideration in astrophysical environments exposed to mild UV irradiation (h$\nu$ &lt; 7 eV). Moreover, their detection via rotational spectroscopy in such regions is facilitated by their closed-shell electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Blowing Star Formation Away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- IV. Serendipitous discovery of a $z\sim2.9$ star-forming galaxy lensed by the galactic bulge of CGCG 012-070 using JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06696v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a gravitationally lensed galaxy by the nearby spiral galaxy CGCG 012-070 ($z = 0.048$) using Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The lensed galaxy is identified through the flux distributions of emission lines in the rest-frame optical, consistent with a source located at a redshift of $z\sim2.89$. The system is detected in [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ emission lines, exhibiting line ratios typical of a star-forming galaxy. The emission-line flux distributions reveal three distinct components, which are modeled using an elliptical power-law (EPL) mass profile for the lens galaxy. This model provides a good characterization of the source and reveals a disturbed star-forming morphology consistent with those of galaxies at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>The EDGE-CALIFA survey: The effect of active galactic nucleus feedback on the integrated properties of galaxies at different stages of their evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy quenching, the intricate process through which galaxies transition from active star-forming states to retired ones, remains a complex phenomenon that requires further investigation. This study investigates the role of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in regulating star formation by analyzing a sample of 643 nearby galaxies with redshifts between 0.005 and 0.03 from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. Galaxies were classified according to the Quenching Stages and Nuclear Activity (QueStNA) scheme, which categorizes them based on their quenching stage and the presence of nuclear activity. We further utilized the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), which combined homogenized optical integral field unit and CO observations. This allowed us to examine how AGNs influence the molecular gas reservoirs of active galaxies compared to their non-active counterparts at similar evolutionary stages. Our Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-squared tests indicate that the star formation property distributions and scaling relations of AGN hosts are largely consistent with those of non-active galaxies. However, AGN hosts exhibit systematically higher molecular gas masses across all quenching stages except for the quiescent nuclear ring stage. We find that AGN hosts follow the expected trends of non-active quenching galaxies, characterized by a lower star formation efficiency and molecular gas fraction compared to star-forming galaxies. Our results suggest that signatures of instantaneous AGN feedback are not prominent in the global molecular gas and star formation properties of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): from filaments to voids, how extreme environment affects gas metallicity and SFR in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the stellar mass-metallicity (M-Z) and stellar mass-star formation rate (M-SFR) relations for star-forming galaxies classified by their environment and compare them with matched control samples of field galaxies. Using data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the filament catalogue, which categorises galaxies into filaments, tendrils, and voids, we correct emission lines for dust extinction and select star-forming galaxies based on the BPT diagram. Metallicity and star formation rate are estimated and used to fit the M-Z and M-SFR relations through both Bayesian and least-squares approaches. We find that metallicity increases in denser environments, while star formation rate decreases, with the most notable contrasts seen between filament/tendril galaxies and those in voids. Galaxies in filaments and tendrils that are not group members show little to no deviation from their control samples. Morphological analysis reveals no significant differences. Overall, galaxies in denser environments appear more chemically enriched with lower SFRs, likely due to processed material and reduced cold gas availability, while isolated void galaxies maintain higher SFRs and lower metallicities, possibly due to ongoing cold gas accretion. These results suggest that local environmental conditions, rather than large-scale structure alone, are the main drivers of the observed trends.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved H$\alpha$ emission in B14-65666: compact starbursts, ionizing efficiency and gas kinematics in an advanced merger at the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MIRIM) of B14-65666, a Lyman-break and interacting galaxy at redshift $z$=7.15. We detect the H$\alpha$ line emission in this system, revealing a spatially-resolved structure of the H$\alpha$ emitting gas, which consists of two distinct galaxies, E and W, at a projected distance of 0.4". Galaxy E is very compact in the rest-frame UV, while W galaxy is more extended, showing a clumpy structure reminiscent of a tidal tail. The total H$\alpha$ luminosity implies that the system is forming stars at a Star Formation Rate (SFR) of 76$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 30$\pm$4 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for E and W, respectively. The ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range measured in galaxies at similar redshifts. The high values derived for the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW) and the distinct locations of the E and W galaxies in the $\log(\zeta_\mathrm{ion}$) $-$ EW (H$\alpha$) plane, indicate that the system is dominated by a young (less than 10 Myr) stellar population. The overall spectral energy distribution suggests that in addition to a young stellar population, the two galaxies may have mature stellar population and very different dust attenuation. The derived SFR and stellar masses identify the two galaxies as going through a starburst phase. The kinematics of the ionized gas traced by the H$\alpha$ line show a velocity difference of 175 $\pm$ 28 km s$^{-1}$ between the two components of B14-65666. The in-depth study of systems like B14-65666 reveal how galaxy mergers in the early Universe drive intense star formation, shape the interstellar medium, and influence the buildup of stellar mass, just 700 $-$ 800 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>The Spheroidal Bulge of the Milky Way: Chemodynamically Distinct from the Inner-Thick Disc and Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the composition and origin of the inner region of our Galaxy -- the "Galactic bulge" -- is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies. We present new observational constraints based on a sample of around 18,000 stars in the inner Galaxy, combining Gaia DR3 RVS and APOGEE DR17 spectroscopy. Gaia-RVS complements APOGEE by improving sampling of the metallicity, [Fe/H] in the -2.0 to -0.5 dex range. This work marks the first application of Gaia-RVS spectroscopy to the bulge region, enabled by a novel machine learning approach (hybrid-CNN) that derives stellar parameters from intermediate-resolution spectra with precision comparable to APOGEE's infrared data. We performed full orbit integrations using a barred Galactic potential and applied orbital frequency analysis to disentangle the stellar populations in the inner Milky Way. For the first time, traced by the field stars, we are able to robustly identify the long-sought pressure supported bulge. We show this stellar population to be chemically and kinematically distinct from the other main components co-existing in the same region. The spheroidal bulge has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) peak at around -0.70 dex extending to solar value, is dominated by a high-[alpha/Fe] population with almost no dependency on metallicity, consistent with very rapid early formation, predating the thick disc and the bar. We find evidence that the bar has influenced the dynamics of the spheroidal bulge, introducing a mild triaxiality and radial extension. We identify a group of stars on X4 orbits, likely native to the early spheroid, as this population mimics the chemistry of the spheroidal bulge, with a minor contamination from the more metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; -1.0) halo. We find the inner-thick disc to be kinematically hotter (mean Vphi ~125 km/s) than the local-thick disc. ...</description>

      <title>The Nineteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping the local and distant Universe is key to our understanding of it. For decades, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has made a concerted effort to map millions of celestial objects to constrain the physical processes that govern our Universe. The most recent and fifth generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is organized into three scientific ``mappers". Milky Way Mapper (MWM) that aims to chart the various components of the Milky Way and constrain its formation and assembly, Black Hole Mapper (BHM), which focuses on understanding supermassive black holes in distant galaxies across the Universe, and Local Volume Mapper (LVM), which uses integral field spectroscopy to map the ionized interstellar medium in the local group. This paper describes and outlines the scope and content for the nineteenth data release (DR19) of SDSS and the most substantial to date in SDSS-V. DR19 is the first to contain data from all three mappers. Additionally, we also describe nine value added catalogs (VACs) that enhance the science that can be conducted with the SDSS-V data. Finally, we discuss how to access SDSS DR19 and provide illustrative examples and tutorials.</description>

      <title>Dating N loud AGNs at high redshift: GS3073 as a snapshot of wCen like evolution of a nuclear star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address two major questions raised by recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of the young Universe, namely: 1) what are the seed initial masses, and how rapidly have supermassive black holes (BHs) with masses of 1e6-1e8Msun grown in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosted by very young galaxies? 2) What are the plausible explanations for the super solar abundances of nitrogen in a fraction of young galaxies at high redshift, both with and without evidence of a massive central black hole? We focus mainly on the system GS3073. This system shows an exceptionally large log(N/O)=+0.42(+0.13/-0.10) in the gas close to the AGN. We show here that this abundance is consistent with the composition of gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch stars. Moreover, this system shows chemical properties matching those expected at a specific point of the evolution of the abundances in the extreme populations of the former nuclear star cluster wCentauri (wCen). This analogy, along with the N/O, C/O and Fe/O abundances in GS3073, lead to an estimate of an age range of 270-440 Myr for this object, much smaller than the redshift (z=5.5) age of about 1 Gyr. We also adopt the same criteria to estimate an age for GNz11. These two determinations constrain the BH mass versus age relation: accretion on the BH must proceed at intermittent superEddington rates in the first phases, and at a much lower rate after the first half gigayear of life of the Universe. The intermittency of accretion is also a fundamental requirement to allow the formation of the extreme (N rich, O depleted, He rich) populations today observed in wCen for a large range of metallicities.</description>

      <title>Growing the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in Omega Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of fast-moving stars in the core of Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, has provided strong evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). As $\omega$ Cen, is likely the accreted nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, this IMBH also represents a unique opportunity to study BH seeding mechanisms and their potential role in the formation of supermassive BHs. We present Monte Carlo $N$-body models of $\omega$ Cen with detailed treatments for the loss cone dynamics involving stars, binaries, and compact objects. Starting with BH seeds of $500-5000 \, M_{\odot}$ (consistent with runaway collisions of massive stars), our cluster models grow IMBHs with masses of $\sim50{,}000 \, M_{\odot}$ after 12 Gyr, while successfully reproducing the present-day surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of $\omega$ Cen. We find a population of fast stars similar to those observed in the core of $\omega$ Cen, with the fastest stars originating from binaries that were tidally disrupted by the IMBH. The IMBH growth is primarily driven by mergers with $30-40 \, M_{\odot}$ BHs, suggesting a present-day IMBH-BH merger rate of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in $\omega$ Cen-like GCs. Our models also predict a similar rate of tidal disruption events ($\sim5\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$) which, depending on the frequency of $\omega$ Cen-like GCs per galaxy, may represent anywhere from $0.1\%$ to $10\%$ of the observed TDE rate.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Stellar Atmospheres with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Kurucz-a1, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that emulates 1D stellar atmosphere models under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), addressing a critical bottleneck in differentiable stellar spectroscopy. By incorporating hydrostatic equilibrium as a physical constraint during training, Kurucz-a1 creates a differentiable atmospheric structure solver that maintains physical consistency while achieving computational efficiency. Kurucz-a1 can achieve superior hydrostatic equilibrium and more consistent with the solar observed spectra compared to ATLAS-12 itself, demonstrating the advantages of modern optimization techniques. Combined with modern differentiable radiative transfer codes, this approach enables data-driven optimization of universal physical parameters across diverse stellar populations-a capability essential for next-generation stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>TNO colours provide new evidence for a past close flyby of another star to the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thousands of small bodies, known as trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), orbit the Sun beyond Neptune. TNOs are remnants of the planets' formation from a disc of gas and dust, so it is puzzling that they move mostly on eccentric orbits inclined to the planetary plane and show a complex red-to-grey colour distribution. A close stellar flyby can account for the TNOs' dynamics, but it is unclear if this can also explain the correlation between their colours and orbital characteristics. Assuming an initial red-to-grey colour gradient in the disc, our numerical study finds that the spiral arms induced by the stellar flyby simultaneously lead to the observed TNOs' colour patterns and orbital dynamics. The combined explanation of these TNO properties strengthens the evidence for a close flyby of another star to the young Solar System. Our study predicts that (1) small TNOs beyond 60 au will mostly be grey, and (2) retrograde TNOs will lack the colour most common to high-inclination TNOs. The anticipated TNO discoveries by the Vera Rubin telescope will be able to test these predictions. A confirmed flyby would allow us to reveal the chemical composition of the Solar System's primordial disc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observing the stars in our night sky tells us that giant, supergiant and hypergiant stars hold an unique importance in the understanding of stellar populations. Theoretical stellar models predict a rich tapestry of evolved stars. These evolved stars result in supernova explosions for massive stars and the shedding of the outer layers of low- and intermediate-mass stars to form white dwarf stars. Stars on these pathways provide elemental and kinematic feedback that shapes their host galaxies and synthesize the elements that we observe in the Universe today. Observational surveys in the Milky Way and the Local Group of galaxies shape our physical understanding of stellar evolution. Hypergiant stars represent stellar evolution at the extremes, displaying evidence of intense stellar winds combined with luminosities and radii that are unrivalled. Supergiant stars are used as elemental beacons in distant galaxies, and supergiants that cross the Cepheid variable instability strip can be used as rulers to measure the scale of our Universe. The overwhelming majority of stars in the Milky Way will become giant stars. Giants are hundreds of times larger and thousands of times more luminous than the Sun, which makes them excellent tracers of stellar structure. In this chapter, I describe the observational and theoretical manifestations of stellar evolution at various stages and masses. I highlight evolutionary connections between evolved products and comment on their eventual endpoints.</description>

      <title>Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V: Pioneering Panoptic Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V) is pioneering panoptic spectroscopy: it is the first all-sky, multi-epoch, optical-to-infrared spectroscopic survey. SDSS-V is mapping the sky with multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at telescopes in both hemispheres (the 2.5-m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory and the 100-inch du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory), where 500 zonal robotic fiber positioners feed light from a wide-field focal plane to an optical (R$\sim 2000$, 500 fibers) and a near-infrared (R$\sim 22,000$, 300 fibers) spectrograph. In addition to these MOS capabilities, the survey is pioneering ultra wide-field ($\sim$ 4000~deg$^2$) integral field spectroscopy enabled by a new dedicated facility (LVM-I) at Las Campanas Observatory, where an integral field spectrograph (IFS) with 1801 lenslet-coupled fibers arranged in a 0.5 degree diameter hexagon feeds multiple R$\sim$4000 optical spectrographs that cover 3600-9800 angstroms. SDSS-V's hardware and multi-year survey strategy are designed to decode the chemo-dynamical history of the Milky Way Galaxy and tackle fundamental open issues in stellar physics in its Milky Way Mapper program, trace the growth physics of supermassive black holes in its Black Hole Mapper program, and understand the self-regulation mechanisms and the chemical enrichment of galactic ecosystems at the energy-injection scale in its Local Volume Mapper program. The survey is well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major all-sky space missions. The SDSS-V MOS programs began robotic operations in 2021; IFS observations began in 2023 with the completion of the LVM-I facility. SDSS-V builds upon decades of heritage of SDSS's pioneering advances in data analysis, collaboration spirit, infrastructure, and product deliverables in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Investigating the CREDIT history of supernova remnants as cosmic-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been suspected to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Over the past decades, great strides have been made in the modelling of particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and escape from SNRs. Yet while many SNRs have been observed in nonthermal emission in radio, X-rays, and gamma rays, there is no evidence for any individual object contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular spectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent escape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by tens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux uncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily detectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the resulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach. The decision tree that we have trained on simulated data is able to discriminate with very high significance between the null hypothesis of a smooth distribution of sources and the scenario with a stochastic distribution of individual sources. We suggest that this cosmic-ray energy-dependent injection time (CREDIT) scenario be considered in experimental searches to identify individual SNRs as cosmic-ray sources.</description>

      <title>3D ISM structure challenges the Serkowski relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Serkowski relation is the cornerstone of studies of starlight polarization as a function of wavelength. Although empirical, its extensive use since its inception to describe polarization induced by interstellar dust has elevated the relation to the status of an indisputable "law", serving as the benchmark for validating interstellar dust grain models. We revisit the effects of the 3D structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) on the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization. We use analytical models to show how the wavelength dependence of both the polarization fraction and direction is affected by the presence of multiple clouds along the line of sight (LOS), accounting for recent developments in dust distribution modelling and utilizing an expanded archive of stellar polarization measurements. We highlight concrete examples of stars whose polarization profiles are severely affected by LOS variations of the dust grain and magnetic field properties, and we provide a recipe to accurately fit multiple cloud Serkowski models to such cases. We present, for the first time, compelling observational evidence that the 3D structure of the magnetized ISM often results to the violation of the Serkowski relation. We show that 3D effects impact interstellar cloud parameters derived from Serkowski fits. In particular, the dust size distribution in single - cloud sightlines may differ from analyses that ignore 3D effects, with important implications for dust modelling in the Galaxy. Our results suggest that multiband stellar polarization measurements offer an independent probe of the LOS variations of the magnetic field, constituting a valuable new tool for the 3D cartography of the ISM. We caution that, unless 3D effects are explicitly accounted for, a poor fit to the Serkowski relation does not, by itself, constitute conclusive evidence that a star is intrinsically polarized.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Clustering Analysis of 14,000 Ly{\alpha} Emitting Galaxies at z=2.4, 3.1, and 4.5</title>

Abstract: Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are star-forming galaxies that efficiently probe the spatial distribution of galaxies in the high redshift universe. The spatial clustering of LAEs reflects the properties of their individual host dark matter halos, allowing us to study the evolution of the galaxy-halo connection. We analyze the clustering of 5233, 5220, and 3706 LAEs at $z$ = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5, respectively, in the 9 deg$^2$ COSMOS field from the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. After correcting for redshift space distortions, LAE contamination rates, and the integral constraint, the observed angular correlation functions imply linear galaxy bias factors of $b$ = $1.72^{+0.26}_{-0.27}, 2.01^{+0.26}_{-0.29},$ and $2.95^{+0.40}_{-0.46}$, for $z$ = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5, respectively. The median dark matter halo masses inferred from these measurements are $\log(M_{h}/M_{\odot})$ = $11.44^{+0.30}_{-0.28}, 11.13^{+0.26}_{-0.26}$, and $10.85^{+0.24}_{-0.24}$ for the three samples, respectively. The analysis also reveals that LAEs occupy roughly 3-7% of the halos whose clustering strength matches that of the LAEs.</description>

      <title>Extended Emission Line Region in a Post-Starburst Galaxy Hosting Tidal Disruption Event AT2019qiz and Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the extended emission line region (EELR) in the host galaxy of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019qiz, utilizing VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy. The high spatial-resolution data reveal a bi-conical emission structure approximately $3.7~\mathrm{kpc}$ in scale within the galactic center, characterized by a prominent [OIII] line in the nucleus and significant [NII] line emission extending into the EELR. Spectral analysis of the EELR indicates line ratios consistent with Seyfert ionization in the center and LINER-type ionization in the outer diffuse region, suggesting ionization from galactic nuclear activity. The required ionizing luminosity, estimated from the H$\rm{\alpha}$ and H$\rm{\beta}$ luminosities based on the photoionization and recombination balance assumption, is $10^{41.8}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for all spaxels classified as active galactic nucleus (AGN), and $10^{40.7}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for spaxels in the central $0.9~\mathrm{kpc}$ Seyfert region. However, the current bolometric luminosity of the nucleus $L_{\text{bol}} \leq 10^{40.8}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, estimated from quiescent-state soft X-ray observations, is insufficient to ionize the entire EELR, implying a recently faded AGN or a delayed response to historical activity. Stellar population analysis reveals a post-starburst characteristic in the EELR, and the gas kinematics show disturbances and non-circular components compared to the stellar kinematics. Notably, the recent detection of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) in the X-ray light curve of AT2019qiz confirms the TDE-QPE association. Our findings provide direct evidence for an AGN-like EELR in the host galaxy of the nearest TDE with QPE detection, offering new insights into the complex interplay between TDEs, QPEs, AGN activity, and host galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>An extremely metal-poor Lyman $\alpha$ emitter candidate at $z=6$ revealed through absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidate in the immediate foreground of the quasar PSO J158-14 at $z_{\rm QSO}=6.0685$ at a projected distance $\sim29\ {\rm pkpc}$ that is associated with an extremely metal-poor absorption system. This system was found in archival observations of the quasar field with the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (VLT/MUSE) and was previously missed in searches of absorption systems using quasar absorption line spectroscopy as it imparts no detectable metal absorption lines on the background quasar spectrum. The detected Ly$\alpha$ emission line at a redshift of $z_{\rm LAE}=6.0323$ is well aligned with the outer edge of the quasar's proximity zone and can plausibly cause its observed damping wing if it is associated with a proximate sub-damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption system with a column density of $\log {N_{\rm HI} / {\rm cm}^{-2}} \approx 19.7$. A $&gt;10$ hour medium-resolution spectrum of the quasar observed with the Magellan/Folded-port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE) and VLT/X-Shooter spectrographs reveals a metallicity constraint of ${\rm [Z/H]} &lt; -3$. Such low metallicity makes this system an extremely metal-poor galaxy candidate and provides an exciting site to study possible signatures of Population III stars.</description>

Abstract: We re-examine the 7,070 candidate ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the SMUDGes survey and provide classifications based on their visual morphology. Among the more interesting cases, we identify objects along a low surface brightness galaxy merger sequence (ongoing mergers (8) and post-mergers (7)) and a distinct set of dwarf ring galaxies (29). The ring galaxies are hypothesized to be the result of nearly polar-axis collisions, but the responsible companions are undetected. We also highlight objects in the catalog that appear to be tidally affected (66), thereby cautioning that their cataloged parameters may be unreliable. Finally, we identify contaminants of various types in the catalog, leaving 6,553 as viable undisturbed UDG candidates. We discuss all categories and provide example images of the more interesting ones.</description>

Abstract: We study the stellar distribution around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in gas-rich nuclear star clusters (NSCs). NSCs could contain vast amounts of gas, which contribute significantly to shaping the stellar distribution, typically altering the stellar density cusp from the usual Bahcall \&amp; Wolf 1976 solution and consequently affecting the dynamics in the NSC. The dense gaseous environment in NSCs gives rise to dynamical phenomena that are otherwise rare in other gas-free environments. Here we extend the derivation introduced in Bahcall \&amp; Wolf 1976 to include an additional energy dissipation term associated with gas drag. We examine the effect of different forms of gas drag on the stellar density distribution. Finally, we discuss implications on the rates of tidal disruption events and other transients triggered by stellar interactions in gas-rich galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolving the Fundamental Elements of Reionization in Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic reionization marks a critical epoch when the first galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium through the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation. Young, massive star clusters are believed to be the primary LyC sources, yet the physical mechanisms enabling LyC escape remain poorly understood. Most existing studies rely on spatially integrated observations, which lack the resolution to resolve internal galaxy structure and pinpoint where and how LyC photons escape. To address this, we propose a science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) that enables spatially resolved spectroscopy of LyC-emitting star clusters and their environments in low-redshift galaxies. This requires a UV integral field unit (IFU) with coverage down to ~ 900 Angstrom and a spatial resolution of 10-100 pc-capabilities essential for directly detecting LyC escape and mapping the surrounding interstellar medium. With such instrumentation, we will map cluster-scale LyC escape fractions, characterize the physical conditions of the surrounding interstellar medium, and directly observe feedback-driven outflows that facilitate LyC leakage. These observations will enable novel calibrations of indirect LyC indicators at unprecedented spatial resolution and establish direct connections between local LyC processes and those in high-redshift, clumpy star-forming galaxies. In the long run, this program will build the physical framework needed to understand how galaxies reionized the early universe and shaped its subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Flaring Stars in a Non-targeted mm-wave Survey with SPT-3G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a flare star catalog from four years of non-targeted millimeter-wave survey data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The data were taken with the SPT-3G camera and cover a 1500-square-degree region of the sky from $20^{h}40^{m}0^{s}$ to $3^{h}20^{m}0^{s}$ in right ascension and $-42^{\circ}$ to $-70^{\circ}$ in declination. This region was observed on a nearly daily cadence from 2019-2022 and chosen to avoid the plane of the galaxy. A short-duration transient search of this survey yields 111 flaring events from 66 stars, increasing the number of both flaring events and detected flare stars by an order of magnitude from the previous SPT-3G data release. We provide cross-matching to Gaia DR3, as well as matches to X-ray point sources found in the second ROSAT all-sky survey. We have detected flaring stars across the main sequence, from early-type A stars to M dwarfs, as well as a large population of evolved stars. These stars are mostly nearby, spanning 10 to 1000 parsecs in distance. Most of the flare spectral indices are constant or gently rising as a function of frequency at 95/150/220 GHz. The timescale of these events can range from minutes to hours, and the peak $\nu L_{\nu}$ luminosities range from $10^{27}$ to $10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the SPT-3G frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulations of Milky Way Host Mass Dark Matter Halos with a Blue-Tilted Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies at high redshift, challenging the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. Previous studies alleviated this tension with a blue tilted primordial power spectrum ($P(k)\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s&gt;1$ at small scales $&gt;1~{\rm cMpc}^{-1}$). In this study, we examine whether the blue tilted model can boost dark matter substructures especially at low redshift, thereby addressing other potential challenges to the standard cosmology. First, substructures in the standard cosmological model may not be sufficient to explain the anomalous flux ratio problem observed in strong gravitational lensing. Second, the number of observed nearby satellite galaxies could be higher than the theoretical predictions of the standard cosmology, after completeness correction and tidal stripping by baryonic disks. To study the impact of a blue tilted primordial power spectrum on substructures, we perform high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host mass halos, evolving to redshift $z=0$. At $z=0$, we find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses $M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10} ~M\odot$, whereas the subhalo $V_{\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at $\sim$10\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\rm max}$ at a smaller distance $R_{\rm max}$ from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Zoom: Multiscale GRMHD Modeling of Black Hole Accretion and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a ``cyclic zoom'' method to capture the dynamics of accretion flows onto black holes across a vast range of spatial and temporal scales in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. In this method, we cyclically zoom out (derefine) and zoom in (refine) the simulation domain while using a central mask region containing a careful treatment of the coarsened fluid variables to preserve the small-scale physics, in particular the magnetic field dynamics. The method can accelerate GRMHD simulations by $\gtrsim 10^5$ times for problems with large-scale separation. We demonstrate the validity of the technique using a series of tests, including spherically symmetric Bondi accretion, the Blandford-Znajek monopole, magnetized turbulent Bondi accretion, accretion of a magnetized rotating torus, and the long-term evolution of an accreting torus about both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. As applications, we simulate Bondi and rotating torus accretion onto black holes from galactic scales, covering an extremely large dynamic range. In Bondi accretion, the accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $\sim(10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$ with a feedback power of $\sim 0.01 \dot{M} c^2$ for vanishing spin, and $\sim 0.1 \dot{M} c^2$ for spin $a\approx0.9$. In the long-term evolution of a rotating torus, the accretion rate decreases with time as $\dot{M}\propto t^{-2}$ on timescales much longer than the viscous timescale, demonstrating that our method can capture not only quasi-steady problems but also secular evolution. Our new method likewise holds significant promise for applications to many other problems that need to cover vast spatial and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper (MWM): ASPCAP Stellar Parameters and Abundances in SDSS-V Data Release 19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to describe the science verification of Milky Way Mapper (MWM) APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) data products published in Data Release 19 (DR19) of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V). We compare MWM ASPCAP atmospheric parameters T$_{\rm eff}$, log g, 24 abundances of 21 elements (carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen have multiple sources for deriving their abundance values) and their uncertainties determined from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) spectrograph spectra with those of the literature and evaluate their accuracy and precision. We also test the zero-point calibration of the v$_{\rm rad}$ derived by the APOGEE Data Reduction Pipeline. This data release contains ASPCAP parameters for 964,989 stars, including all APOGEE-2 targets expanded with new observations of 336,511 stars from the Apache Point Observatory observed until 4 July 2023. Overall, the new T$_{\rm eff}$ values show excellent agreement with the IRFM scale, while the surface gravities exhibit slight systematic offsets compared to asteroseisimic gravities. The estimated precision of T$_{\rm eff}$ is between 50 and 70 K for giants and 70$-$100 K for dwarfs, while surface gravities are measured with a precision of 0.07$-$0.09 dex for giants. We achieve an estimated precision of 0.02$-$0.04 dex for multiple elements, including metallicity, $\alpha$, Mg, and Si, while the precision of at least 10 elements is better than 0.1 dex.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS" [arXiv:2507.02757]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows a weak cometary activity. Its brightness suggests a maximum radius of ~10km (A/0.05)^{-1/2} for an asteroid with an albedo A. I show that interstellar objects with that radius would amount to an interstellar mass density that is well above the expected mass budget of interstellar comets or asteroids. Given this budget, the detection rate of objects like 3I/ATLAS implies that it is a comet with a small core radius &lt;0.6km, or a member of a rare population with a number density &lt;5x10^{-8}au^{-3} for R&gt;10km. The second possibility would suggest that the rare population of 3I/ATLAS objects favors plunging orbits towards the inner solar system to accommodate their inferred detection rate.</description>
