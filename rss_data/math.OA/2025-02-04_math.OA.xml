      <title>Holomorphic mappings and their fixed points on Spin Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study holomorphic properties of infinite dimensional spin factors.
  Among the infinite dimensional Banach spaces with homogeneous open unit balls, we show that the spin factors are natural outlier spaces in which to ask the question (as was proved in the early 1970s for Hilbert spaces): Do biholomorphic automorphisms $g$ of the open unit ball $B$ have fixed points in $\overline B$? In this paper, for infinite dimensional spin factors, we provide reasonable conditions on $g$ that allow us to explicitly construct fixed points of $g$ lying on $\partial B$. En route, we also prove that every spin factor has the density property.
  In another direction, we focus on (compact) holomorphic maps $f:B\rightarrow B$, having no fixed point in $B$ and examine the sequence of iterates $(f^n)$. As $(f^n)$ does not generally converge, we instead trace the target set $T(f)$ of $f$, that is, the images of all accumulation points of $(f^n)_n$, for any topology finer than the topology of pointwise convergence on B. We prove for a spin factor that $T(f)$ lies on the boundary of a single bidisc unique to $f$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory for Non-full Commutative C*-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the spectral theory of commutative C*-categories to the non full-case, introducing a suitable notion of spectral spaceoid provinding a duality between a category of "non-trivial" *-functors of non-full commutative C*-categories and a category of Takahashi morphisms of "non-full spaceoids" (here defined). As a byproduct we obtain a spectral theorem for a non-full generalization of imprimitivity Hilbert C*-bimodules over commutative unital C*-algebras via continuous sections vanishing at infinity of a Hilbert C*-line-bundle over the graph of a homeomorphism between open subsets of the corresponding Gel'fand spectra of the C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Almost almost periodic type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factors and their 3-cohomology obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an exemple of a full factor $M$ such that its canonical outer modular flow $\sigma^M : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{Out}(M)$ is almost periodic but $M$ has no almost periodic state. This can only happen if the discrete spectrum of $\sigma^M$ contains a nontrivial integral quadratic relation. We show how such a nontrivial relation can produce a 3-cohomological obstruction to the existence of an almost periodic state. To obtain our main theorem, we first strengthen a recent result of Bischoff and Karmakar by showing that for any compact connected abelian group $K$, every cohomology class in $ H^3(K,\mathbb{T})$ can be realized as an obstruction of a $K$-kernel on the hyperfinite $\mathrm{II}_1$ factor. We also prove a positive result : if for a full factor $M$ the outer modular flow $\sigma^M : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{Out}(M)$ is almost periodic, then $M \otimes R$ has an almost periodic state, where $R$ is the hyperfinite $\mathrm{II}_1$ factor. Finally, we prove a positive result for crossed product factors associated to strongly ergodic actions of hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Even Hypergeometric Polynomials and Finite Free Commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the class of even polynomials and their behavior with respect to finite free convolutions. To this end, we use some specific hypergeometric polynomials and a variation of the rectangular finite free convolution to understand even real-rooted polynomials in terms of positive-rooted polynomials. Then, we study some classes of even polynomials that are of interest in finite free probability, such as even hypergeometric polynomials, symmetrizations, and finite free commutators. Specifically, we provide many new examples of these objects, involving classical families of special polynomials (such as Laguerre, Hermite, and Jacobi). Finally, we relate the limiting root distributions of sequences of even polynomials with the corresponding symmetric measures that arise in free probability.</description>

      <title>Inner and characteristic functions in polydiscs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characteristic functions of linear operators are analytic functions that serve as complete unitary invariants. Such functions, as long as they are built in a natural and canonical manner, provide representations of inner functions on a suitable domain and make significant contributions to the development of various theories in Hilbert function spaces. In this paper, we solve this problem in polydiscs. In particular, we present a concrete description of the characteristic functions of tuples of commuting pure contractions and, consequently, provide a description of inner functions on polydiscs.</description>

Abstract: Assume that B(X) is the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space X, and let W in B(X) is such that cl(W(X)) is not equal to X or W=zI, where z is a complex number and I is the identity operator. We show that if f: B(X) --&gt; B(X) is an additive mapping Lie centralizable at W, then f(A)=kA+h(A) for all A in B(X), where k is a complex number and h:B(X)--&gt; CI is an additive mapping such that h([A,B])=0 for all A,B in B(X) with AB=W.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concepts of branched coarse coverings and transfers between coarse homology theories along them. We show that various versions of coarse $K$-homology theories admit the additional structure of transfers. We show versions of Atiyah's $L^{2}$-index theorem in coarse homotopy theory and apply them to give a new argument for the corresponding step in Higson's counterexample to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>

      <title>Additivity and chain rules for quantum entropies via multi-index Schatten norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary entropic measures for quantum states are additive under the tensor product. In the analysis of quantum information processing tasks, the minimum entropy of a set of states, e.g., the minimum output entropy of a channel, often plays a crucial role. A fundamental question in quantum information and cryptography is whether the minimum output entropy remains additive under the tensor product of channels. Here, we establish a general additivity statement for the optimized sandwiched R\'enyi entropy of quantum channels. For that, we generalize the results of [Devetak, Junge, King, Ruskai, CMP 2006] to multi-index Schatten norms. As an application, we strengthen the additivity statement of [Van Himbeeck and Brown, 2025] thus allowing the analysis of time-adaptive quantum cryptographic protocols. In addition, we establish chain rules for R\'enyi conditional entropies that are similar to the ones used for the generalized entropy accumulation theorem of [Metger, Fawzi, Sutter, Renner, CMP 2024].</description>

      <title>Equivariant Spectral Flow for Families of Dirac-type Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting of a proper, cocompact action by a locally compact, unimodular group $G$ on a Riemannian manifold, we construct equivariant spectral flow of paths of Dirac-type operators. This takes values in the $K$-theory of the group $C^*$-algebra of $G$. In the case where $G$ is the fundamental group of a compact manifold, the summation map maps equivariant spectral flow on the universal cover to classical spectral flow on the base manifold. We obtain "index equals spectral flow" results. In the setting of a smooth path of $G$-invariant Riemannian metrics on a $G$-spin manifold, we show that the equivariant spectral flow of the corresponding path of spin Dirac operators relates delocalised $\eta$-invariants and $\rho$-invariants for different positive scalar curvature metrics to each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on our previous works, and in order to relate them with the theory of quantum graphs and the quantum computing principles, we once again try to introduce some newly developed technical structures just by relying on our toy example, the coordinate ring of $n\times n$ quantum matrix algebra $M_q(n)$, and the associated directed locally finite graphs $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_n)$, and the Cuntz-Krieger $C^*$-graph algebras. Meaningly, we introduce a $(4i-6)$-qubit quantum system by using the Cuntz-Krieger $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$-families associated to the $4i-6$ distinct Hamiltonian paths of $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$, for $i\in\{2,\cdots,n\}$. We also will present a proof of a claim raised in our previous paper concerning the graph $C^*$-algebra structure and the associated Cuntz-Krieger $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_n)$-families.</description>

      <title>Application of Operator Theory for the Collatz Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Collatz map (or the $3n{+}1$-map) $f$ is defined on positive integers by setting $f(n)$ equal to $3n+1$ when $n$ is odd and $n/2$ when $n$ is even. The Collatz conjecture states that starting from any positive integer $n$, some iterate of $f$ takes value $1$. In this study, we discuss formulations of the Collatz conjecture by $C^{*}$-algebras in the following three ways: (1) single operator, (2) two operators, and (3) Cuntz algebra. For the $C^{*}$-algebra generated by each of these, we consider the condition that it has no non-trivial reducing subspaces. For (1), we prove that the condition implies the Collatz conjecture. In the cases (2) and (3), we prove that the condition is equivalent to the Collatz conjecture. For similar maps, we introduce equivalence relations by them and generalize connections between the Collatz conjecture and irreducibility of associated $C^{*}$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend unbounded Kasparov theory to encompass conformal group and quantum group equivariance. This new framework allows us to treat conformal actions on both manifolds and noncommutative spaces. As examples, we present unbounded representatives of Kasparov's $\gamma$-element for the real and complex Lorentz groups and display the conformal $SL_q(2)$-equivariance of the standard spectral triple of the Podle\'s sphere. In pursuing descent for conformally equivariant cycles, we are led to a new framework for representing Kasparov classes. Our new representatives are unbounded, possess a dynamical quality, and also include known twisted spectral triples. We define an equivalence relation on these new representatives whose classes form an abelian group surjecting onto KK. The technical innovation which underpins these results is a novel multiplicative perturbation theory. By these means, we obtain Kasparov classes from the bounded transform with minimal side conditions.</description>

      <title>Operator moment dilations as block operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a complex Hilbert space and let $\big\{A_{n}\big\}_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of bounded linear operators on $\mathcal{H}$. Then a bounded operator $B$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{K} \supseteq \mathcal{H}$ is said to be a dilation of this sequence if
  \begin{equation*}
  A_{n} = P_{\mathcal{H}}B^{n}|_{\mathcal{H}} \; \text{for all}\; n\geq 1,
  \end{equation*} where $P_{\mathcal{H}}$ is the projection of $\mathcal{K}$ onto $\mathcal{H}.$ The question of existence of dilation is a generalization of the classical moment problem. We recall necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of self-adjoint, isometric and unitary dilations and present block operator representations for these dilations. For instance, for self-adjoint dilations one gets block tridiagonal representations similar to the classical moment problem.
  Given a positive invertible operator $A$, an operator $T$ is said to be in the $\mathcal{C}_{A}$-class if the sequence $\{A^{-\frac{1}{2}}T^nA^{-\frac{1}{2}}:n\geq 1\}$ admits a unitary dilation. We identify a tractable collection of $\mathcal{C}_A$-class operators for which isometric and unitary dilations can be written down explicitly in block operator form. This includes the well-known $\rho$-dilations for positive scalars. Here the special cases $\rho =1$ and $\rho =2$ correspond to Sch\"{a}ffer representation for contractions and Ando representation for operators with numerical radius not more than one respectively.</description>

Abstract: We give a new combinatorial proof of Parraud's formula for the asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/N^2$ for the expected trace of polynomials of several independent $N \times N$ GUE matrices, which expresses the result using a mixture of free difference quotients, introducing new freely independent semicircular variables, and integration with respect to parameters. Our approach streamlines the statement of the formula while clarifying its relationship to the combinatorial genus expansion.</description>
