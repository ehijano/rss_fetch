      <title>Effect of Attachment Surface on Biofilm Response and the Dissipation of PAHs and nitrogen in Submerged Plant System under the application of Bactericide and Algaecide</title>

Abstract: The biofilms response on active attachment surfaces (submerged plant leaves) and inert attachment surfaces (biomimetic plant glass attachment surfaces) and their effects on PAHs and nitrogen transformation under the application conditions of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs were investigated by lab simulated hydroponics and high-throughput molecular biology methods in Vallisneria natans (VN), Hydrilla verticillata (HV) and biomimetic plants (BP) systems. Results showed that the introduction of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs changed the microorganism composition in biofilm, the presence or absence of submerged plants was the primary factor causing differences in microbial communities. Moreover, the microbial diversity and endemic species of biomimetic plant biofilms were higher than those of submerged plant systems, indicating that submerged plants have selectively induced the reconstruction of biofilm-leaves. The introduction of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs leads to abnormal accumulation of TP and NH3-N in overlying water, as well as NO3-N and TP content in sediment. However, submerged plants can weaken and alleviate the stress effects of these factors on nitrogen and phosphorus conversion. Compared to the inert biomimetic plant glass surface, the presence of active surfaces in submerged plants results in a much higher abundance of PAHs degrading bacteria (Sphingomonas and Novosphingobium) and nitrogen converting bacteria (e.g. denitrifying bacteria of Methylophilus, Methylotenera, Flavobacterium, Hydrogenophaga, Aquabacterium, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria of Rhizobium, Azoarcus, Rhizobacter, Azonexus) in biofilm-leaves of submerged plants after the addition of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs. Coupled degradation of PAHs and nitrogen occurs, which is beneficial for the treatment of combined pollution caused by PAHs and nitrogen.</description>
