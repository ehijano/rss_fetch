      <title>Defining, Understanding, and Detecting Online Toxicity: Challenges and Machine Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online toxic content has grown into a pervasive phenomenon, intensifying during times of crisis, elections, and social unrest. A significant amount of research has been focused on detecting or analyzing toxic content using machine-learning approaches. The proliferation of toxic content across digital platforms has spurred extensive research into automated detection mechanisms, primarily driven by advances in machine learning and natural language processing. Overall, the present study represents the synthesis of 140 publications on different types of toxic content on digital platforms. We present a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in previous studies focusing on definitions, data sources, challenges, and machine learning approaches employed in detecting online toxicity, such as hate speech, offensive language, and harmful discourse. The dataset encompasses content in 32 languages, covering topics such as elections, spontaneous events, and crises. We examine the possibility of using existing cross-platform data to improve the performance of classification models. We present the recommendations and guidelines for new research on online toxic consent and the use of content moderation for mitigation. Finally, we present some practical guidelines to mitigate toxic content from online platforms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hate Speech Detection: Evaluating 38 Models from Traditional Methods to Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech on social media necessitates automated detection systems that balance accuracy with computational efficiency. This study evaluates 38 model configurations in detecting hate speech across datasets ranging from 6.5K to 451K samples. We analyze transformer architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Distil-BERT), deep neural networks (e.g., CNN, LSTM, GRU, Hierarchical Attention Networks), and traditional machine learning methods (e.g., SVM, CatBoost, Random Forest). Our results show that transformers, particularly RoBERTa, consistently achieve superior performance with accuracy and F1-scores exceeding 90%. Among deep learning approaches, Hierarchical Attention Networks yield the best results, while traditional methods like CatBoost and SVM remain competitive, achieving F1-scores above 88% with significantly lower computational costs. Additionally, our analysis highlights the importance of dataset characteristics, with balanced, moderately sized unprocessed datasets outperforming larger, preprocessed datasets. These findings offer valuable insights for developing efficient and effective hate speech detection systems.</description>

      <title>Value Alignment of Social Media Ranking Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While social media feed rankings are primarily driven by engagement signals rather than any explicit value system, the resulting algorithmic feeds are not value-neutral: engagement may prioritize specific individualistic values. This paper presents an approach for social media feed value alignment. We adopt Schwartz's theory of Basic Human Values -- a broad set of human values that articulates complementary and opposing values forming the building blocks of many cultures -- and we implement an algorithmic approach that models and then ranks feeds by expressions of Schwartz's values in social media posts. Our approach enables controls where users can express weights on their desired values, combining these weights and post value expressions into a ranking that respects users' articulated trade-offs. Through controlled experiments (N=141 and N=250), we demonstrate that users can use these controls to architect feeds reflecting their desired values. Across users, value-ranked feeds align with personal values, diverging substantially from existing engagement-driven feeds.</description>

      <title>Robust and Secure Computation Offloading and Trajectory Optimization for Multi-UAV MEC Against Aerial Eavesdropper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multi-access edge computing (MEC) appears as a popular paradigm to reduce task processing latency. However, the secure offloading is an important issue when occurring aerial eavesdropping. Besides, the potential uncertainties in practical applications and flexible trajectory optimizations of UAVs pose formidable challenges for realizing robust offloading. In this paper, we consider the aerial secure MEC network including ground users, service unmanned aerial vehicles (S-UAVs) integrated with edge servers, and malicious UAVs overhearing transmission links. To deal with the task computation complexities, which are characterized as uncertainties, a robust problem is formulated with chance constraints. The energy cost is minimized by optimizing the connections, trajectories of S-UAVs and offloading ratios. Then, the proposed non-linear problem is tackled via the distributionally robust optimization and conditional value-at-risk mechanism, which is further transformed into the second order cone programming forms. Moreover, we decouple the reformulated problem and design the successive convex approximation for S-UAV trajectories. The global algorithm is designed to solve the sub-problems in a block coordinate decent manner. Finally, extensive simulations and numerical analyses are conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithms, with just 2\% more energy cost compared with the ideal circumstance.</description>

      <title>Structural Dynamics of Harmful Content Dissemination on WhatsApp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WhatsApp, a platform with more than two billion global users, plays a crucial role in digital communication, but also serves as a vector for harmful content such as misinformation, hate speech, and political propaganda. This study examines the dynamics of harmful message dissemination in WhatsApp groups, with a focus on their structural characteristics. Using a comprehensive data set of more than 5.1 million messages, including text, images, and videos, collected from approximately 6,000 groups in India, we reconstruct message propagation cascades to analyze dissemination patterns. Our findings reveal that harmful messages consistently achieve greater depth and breadth of dissemination compared to messages without harmful annotations, with videos and images emerging as the primary modes of dissemination. These results suggest a distinctive pattern of dissemination of harmful content. However, our analysis indicates that modality alone cannot fully account for the structural differences in propagation.The findings highlight the critical role of structural characteristics in the spread of these harmful messages, suggesting that strategies targeting structural characteristics of re-sharing could be crucial in managing the dissemination of such content on private messaging platforms.</description>

      <title>Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.</description>

      <title>Media Bias and Polarization through the Lens of a Markov Switching Latent Space Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: News outlets are now more than ever incentivized to provide their audience with slanted news, while the intrinsic homophilic nature of online social media may exacerbate polarized opinions. Here, we propose a new dynamic latent space model for time-varying online audience-duplication networks, which exploits social media content to conduct inference on media bias and polarization of news outlets. We contribute to the literature in several directions: 1) Our model provides a novel measure of media bias that combines information from both network data and text-based indicators; 2) we endow our model with Markov-Switching dynamics to capture polarization regimes while maintaining a parsimonious specification; 3) we contribute to the literature on the statistical properties of latent space network models. The proposed model is applied to a set of data on the online activity of national and local news outlets from four European countries in the years 2015 and 2016. We find evidence of a strong positive correlation between our media slant measure and a well-grounded external source of media bias. In addition, we provide insight into the polarization regimes across the four countries considered.</description>

      <title>Life Finds A Way: Emergence of Cooperative Structures in Adaptive Threshold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition.
  We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help''/``harm''), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both connectivity and resilience.
  Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.</description>
