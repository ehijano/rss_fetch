      <title>On bipartite $(1,1,k)$-mixed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed graphs can be seen as digraphs with arcs and edges (or digons, that is, two opposite arcs). In this paper, we consider the case where such graphs are bipartite and in which the undirected and directed degrees are one. The best graphs, in terms of the number of vertices, are presented for small diameters. Moreover, two infinite families of such graphs with diameter $k$ and number of vertices of the order of $2^{k/2}$ are proposed, one of them being totally regular $(1,1)$-mixed graphs. In addition, we present two more infinite families called chordal ring and chordal double ring mixed graphs, which are bipartite and related to tessellations of the plane. Finally, we give an upper bound that improves the Moore bound for bipartite mixed graphs for $r = z = 1$.</description>

      <title>A census of graph-drawing algorithms based on generalized transversal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define graph drawing algorithms which simultaneously generalize several classical ones. More precisely, we consider the following algorithms:
  (a) Fusy's algorithm for the straight-line grid drawing of planar triangulations, based on transversal structures,
  (b) Barri\`ere and Huemmer's algorithm for the straight-line grid drawing of planar quadrangulations, based on separating decompositions,
  (c) He's algorithm for the orthogonal drawing of 3-valent planar maps, based on transversal structures,
  (d) Bernardi \&amp; Fusy 's algorithm for the orthogonal drawing of 4-valent planar maps, based on 2-orientations.
  We present an algorithm generalizing (a) and (b) which produces a straight line grid drawing for planar maps with faces of degree at most 4, and we present an algorithm generalizing (c) and (d) which produces an orthogonal drawing for planar maps with vertices of degree at most 4. Our two algorithms are based on a class of combinatorial structures called grand-Schnyder woods.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Polynomials of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, a $k$-coloring $c:V(G)\to \{1,2,\ldots, k\}$ is called distinguishing, if the only automorphism $f$ of $G$ with the property $c(v)=c(f(v))$ for every vertex $v\in G$ (color-preserving automorphism), is the identity. In this paper, we show that the number of distinguishing $k$-colorings of $G$ is a monic polynomial in $k$, calling it the distinguishing polynomial of $G$. Furthermore, we compute the distinguishing polynomials of cycles and complete multipartite graphs. We also show that the multiplicity of zero as a root of the distinguishing polynomial of $G$ is at least the number of orbits of $G$.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we study the relation between Grundy numbers of a Maximum Nim and Josephus problem. Let f(x) = floor(x/k), where floor( ) is the floor function and k is a positive integer. We prove that there is a simple relation with a Maximum Nim with the rule function f and the Josephus problem in which every k-th numbers are to be removed.</description>

      <title>On the $k$-anti-traceability Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oriented graph is called $k$-anti-traceable if the subdigraph induced by every subset with $k$ vertices has a hamiltonian anti-directed path. In this paper, we consider an anti-traceability conjecture. In particular, we confirm this conjecture holds when $k\leq 4$. We also show that every sufficiently large $k$-anti-traceable oriented graph admits an anti-path that contains $n-o(n)$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query LTCs and Lifted Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sheaves on posets, showing that cosystolic expansion of such sheaves can be derived from local expansion conditions of the sheaf and the poset (typically a high dimensional expander). When the poset at hand is a cell complex, a sheaf on it may be thought of as generalizing coefficient groups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group vary along the cell complex. Previous works established local criteria for cosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes and with respect to constant coefficients. Cosystolic expansion of sheaves is related to property testing. We use this relation and our local criterion for cosystolic expansion to give two applications to locally testable codes (LTCs).
  First, we show the existence of good $2$-query LTCs. These codes are related to the recent good $q$-query LTCs of Dinur et. al and Panteleev-Kalachev, being the formers' so-called line codes, but we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective, namely, by realizing them as cocycle codes of sheaves over posets. We then derive their good properties directly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.
  Second, we give a local criterion for a a lifted code (with some auxiliary structure) to be locally testable. This improves on a previous work of Dikstein et. al, where it was shown that one can obtain local testability of lifted codes from a mixture of local and global conditions.</description>

      <title>On 5-cycles and strong 5-subtournaments in a tournament of odd order n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tournament of odd order $n\ge 5,$ $c_{m}(T)$ be the number of its $m$-cycles, and $s_{m}(T)$ be the number of its strongly connected $m$-subtournaments. Due to work of L.W. Beineke and F. Harary, it is well known that $s_{m}(T)\le s_{m}(RLT_{n}),$ where $RLT_{n}$ is the regular locally transitive tournament of order $n.$ For $m=3$ and $m=4,$ $c_{m}(T)$ equals $s_{m}(T),$ but it is not so for $m\ge 5.$ As J.W. Moon pointed out in his note in 1966, the problem of determining the maximum of $c_{m}(T)$ seems very difficult in general (i.e. for $m\ge 5$). In the present paper, based on the Komarov-Mackey formula for $c_{5}(T)$ obtained recently, we prove that $c_{5}(T)\le (n+1)n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)/160$ with equality holding iff $T$ is doubly regular. A formula for $s_{5}(T)$ is also deduced. With the use of it, we show that $s_{5}(T)\le (n+1)n(n-1)(n-3)(11n-47)/1920$ with equality holding iff $T=RLT_{n}$ or $n=7$ and $T$ is regular or $n=5$ and $T$ is strong. It is also proved that for a regular tournament $T$ of (odd) order $n\ge 9,$ a lower bound $(n+1)n(n-1)(n-3)(17n-59)/3840\le s_{5}(T)$ holds with equality iff $T$ is doubly regular. These results are compared with the ones recently obtained by the author for $c_{5}(T).$</description>

      <title>On reduced unicellular hypermonopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of counting unicellular hypermonopoles by the number of their hyperedges is equivalent to describing the cycle length distribution of a product of two circular permutations, first solved by Zagier. The solution of this problem has also been used in the study of the cycle graph model of Bafna and Pevzner and of related models in mathematical biology. In this paper we develop a method to compute the finite number of reduced unicellular hypermonopoles of a given genus. The problem of representing any hypermap as a drawing is known to be simplifiable to solving the same problem for reduced unicellular hypermonopoles. We also outline a correspondence between our hypermap model, the cycle graph model of Bafna and Pevzner, and the polygon gluing model of Alexeev and Zograf. Reduced unicellular hypermonopoles correspond to reduced objects in the other models as well, and the notion of genus is the same.</description>

      <title>$q$-Chromatic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a $q$-version of the chromatic polynomial of a given graph $G=(V,E)$, namely, \[ \chi_G^\lambda(q,n) \ := \sum_{\substack{\text{proper colorings}\\ c\,:\,V\to[n]}} q^{ \sum_{ v \in V } \lambda_v c(v) }, \] where $\lambda \in \mathbb{Z}^V$ is a fixed linear form. Via work of Chapoton (2016) on $q$-Ehrhart polynomials, $\chi_G^\lambda(q,n)$ turns out to be a polynomial in the $q$-integer $[n]_q$, with coefficients that are rational functions in $q$. Additionally, we prove structural results for $\chi_G^\lambda(q,n)$ and exhibit connections to neighboring concepts, e.g., chromatic symmetric functions and the arithmetic of order polytopes. We offer a strengthened version of Stanley's conjecture that the chromatic symmetric function distinguishes trees, which leads to an analogue of $P$-partitions for graphs.</description>

      <title>Refining tree-decompositions so that they display the k-blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carmesin and Gollin proved that every finite graph has a canonical tree-decomposition $(T, \mathcal{V})$ of adhesion less than $k$ that efficiently distinguishes every two distinct $k$-profiles, and which has the further property that every separable $k$-block is equal to the unique part of $(T, \mathcal{V})$ in which it is contained.
  We give a shorter proof of this result by showing that such a tree-decomposition can in fact be obtained from any canonical tight tree-decomposition of adhesion less than $k$. For this, we decompose the parts of such a tree-decomposition by further tree-decompositions. As an application, we also obtain a generalization of Carmesin and Gollin's result to locally finite graphs.</description>

Berberian has given a partial solution to this problem. Khairnar and Waphare raised a similar problem for p.q.-Baer $*$-rings and gave a partial solution.

In particular, this result applies to the set of all factors of a morphic word. We provide a formalized proof in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL as part of the Combinatorics on Words Formalized project.</description>

      <title>Global Rigidity of Triangulated Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is the graph of a connected triangulated $(d-1)$-manifold, for $d\geq 3$, then $G$ is generically globally rigid in $\mathbb R^d$ if and only if it is $(d+1)$-connected and, if $d=3$, $G$ is not planar. The special case $d=3$ verifies a conjecture of Connelly. Our results actually apply to a much larger class of simplicial complexes, namely the circuits of the simplicial matroid. We also give two significant applications of our main theorems. We show that that the characterisation of pseudomanifolds with extremal edge numbers given by the Lower Bound Theorem extends to circuits of the simplicial matroid. We also prove the generic case of a conjecture of Kalai concerning the reconstructability of a polytope from its space of stresses. The proofs of our main results adapt earlier ideas of Fogelsanger and Whiteley to the setting of global rigidity. In particular we verify a special case of Whiteley's vertex splitting conjecture for global rigidity.</description>

      <title>Online Ramsey numbers of ordered paths and cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ordered graph is a graph with a linear ordering on its vertices. The online Ramsey game for ordered graphs $G$ and $H$ is played on an infinite sequence of vertices; on each turn, Builder draws an edge between two vertices, and Painter colors it red or blue. Builder tries to create a red $G$ or a blue $H$ as quickly as possible, while Painter wants the opposite. The online ordered Ramsey number $r_o(G,H)$ is the number of turns the game lasts with optimal play.
  In this paper, we consider the behavior of $r_o(G,P_n)$ for fixed $G$, where $P_n$ is the monotone ordered path. We prove an $O(n \log_2n)$ bound on $r_o(G,P_n)$ for all $G$ and an $O(n)$ bound when $G$ is $3$-ichromatic; we partially classify graphs $G$ with $r_o(G,P_n) = n + O(1)$. Many of these results extend to $r_o(G,C_n)$, where $C_n$ is an ordered cycle obtained from $P_n$ by adding one edge.</description>

      <title>Multicolor bipartite Ramsey number of double stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $n, m$, the double star $S(n,m)$ is the graph consisting of the disjoint union of two stars $K_{1,n}$ and $K_{1,m}$ together with an edge joining their centers. Finding monochromatic copies of double stars in edge-colored complete bipartite graphs has attracted much attention. The $k$-color bipartite Ramsey number of $ S(n,m)$, denoted by $r_{bip}(S(n,m);k)$, is the smallest integer $N$ such that, in any $k$-coloring of the edges of the complete bipartite graph $K_{N,N}$, there is a monochromatic copy of $S(n,m)$. The study of bipartite Ramsey numbers was initiated in the early 1970s by Faudree and Schelp and, independently, by Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel. The exact value of $r_{bip}(S(n,m);k)$ is only known when $n=m=1$. Applying the Tur\'an argument in the bipartite setting, here we prove that if $k=2$ and $n\ge m$, or $k\ge3$ and $n\ge 2m$, then \[ r_{bip}(S(n,m);k)=kn+1.\]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent preprints, Cigler considered certain Hankel determinants of convoluted Catalan numbers and conjectured identities for these determinants. In this note, we shall give a bijective proof of Cigler's Conjecture by interpreting determinants as generating functions of nonintersecting lattice paths: this proof employs the reflection principle, the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot-method and a certain construction involving reflections and overlays of nonintersecting lattice paths. Shortly after this bijective proof was presented here, Cigler provided a shorter proof based on earlier results.</description>

      <title>Freeness of hyperplane arrangements associated with gain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Athanasiadis studied arrangements obtained by adding shifted hyperplanes to the braid arrangement. Similarly, Bailey studied arrangements obtained by adding tilted hyperplanes to the braid arrangement. These two kinds of arrangements are associated with directed graphs and their freeness was characterized in terms of the associated graphs. In addition, there is coincidence of freeness. Namely, if Athanasiadis' arrangement is free, then the corresponding Bailey's arrangement is free, and vice versa.
  In this paper, we generalize this phenomenon by using gain graphs.</description>

      <title>Noncompact surfaces, triangulations and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every noncompact surface is shown to have a (3,6)-tight triangulation and a characterisation of such triangulations is given in terms of length constraints on the boundary walks of superfaces of a given genus. Applications are given to the generic rigidity of associated countable bar-joint frameworks in R^3. In particular, every noncompact surface has a (3,6)-tight triangulation that is minimally 3-rigid. A proof of Ker\'ekj\'art\'o's classification of noncompact surfaces is also given.</description>

      <title>On two problems involving unit fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham proposed to determine the number of subsets $S \subseteq \left\{1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ with $\sum_{s \in S} 1/s = 1$ and asked, among other things, whether that number could be as large as $2^{n - o(n)}$. We show that the number of subsets $S \subseteq \left\{1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ with $\sum_{s \in S} 1/s \leq 1$ is smaller than $2^{0.93n}$. We also answer another question of Erd\H{o}s-Graham by proving the existence of $\delta \in \left\{-1,0,1\right\}^n$ such that $0 &lt; \sum_{k=1}^{n} \delta_k/k \leq c \cdot 2^{-n}$ where $c$ is independent of $n$.</description>

      <title>Depth of Binomial Edge Ideals in terms of Diameter and Vertex Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected non-complete graph and $J_G$ be its binomial edge ideal in a polynomial ring $S$. Using certain invariants associated to graphs, say $U(G)$, Banerjee and N\'{u}\~{n}ez-Betancourt gave an upper bound for the depth of $S/J_G$, and Rouzbahani Malayeri, Saeedi Madani and Kiani obtained a lower bound, say $L(G)$. Hibi and Saeedi Madani gave a structural classification of graphs satisfying $L(G)=U(G)$. In this article, we give structural classification of graphs satisfying $L(G)+1=U(G)$. We also compute the depth of $S/J_G$ for all such graphs $G$.</description>

      <title>Discretized sum-product type problems: Energy variants and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide estimates for the additive discretized energy of \[\sum_{c\in C} |\{(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2)\in A^2\times B^2: |(a_1 +cb_1) - (a_2 + cb_2)|\le \delta\}|_{\delta},\] that depend on non-concentration conditions of the sets. Our proof follows the Guth-Katz-Zahl approach (2021) with appropriate changes along the way clarifying and optimizing many of the steps. Several applications will also be discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define bigraded persistent homology modules and bigraded barcodes of a finite pseudo-metric space X using the ordinary and double homology of the moment-angle complex associated with the Vietoris-Rips filtration of X. We prove a stability theorem for the bigraded persistent double homology modules and barcodes.</description>

      <title>Algebraic properties of binomial edge ideals of Levi graphs associated with curve arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study algebraic properties of binomial edge ideals of Levi graphs associated with certain plane curve arrangements. Using combinatorial properties of Levi graphs, we discuss the Cohen-Macaulayness of binomial edge ideals of Levi graphs associated to some curve arrangements in the complex projective plane, like the $d$-arrangement of curves and the conic-line arrangements. We also discuss the existence of certain induced cycles in the Levi graphs of these arrangements and obtain lower bounds for the regularity of powers of the corresponding binomial edge ideals.</description>
