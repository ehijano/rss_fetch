      <title>Presence of $^{236}$U and $^{237}$Np in a marine ecosystem: the northern Benguela Upwelling System, a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Benguela Upwelling System (BUS), off the south-western African coast, is one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems in the oceans. However, despite its very interesting characteristics, this area has been almost overlooked in the field of environmental radioactivity. In this work, it has been carried out for the first time the combined study of $^{236}$U and $^{237}$Np in the coast of Namibia within the northern BUS. Surface seawater exhibited similar $^{236}$U and $^{237}$Np concentrations, ranging from $3.9\times10^6$ to $5.6\times10^6$ atoms/kg and from $4.6\times10^6$ to $8.5\times10^6$ atoms/kg, respectively. The observed inventories in a water column from the continental margin, of $(2.10 \pm 0.11)\times10^12$ atoms m$^{-2}$ for $^{236}$U and $(3.48 \pm 0.13)\times10^{12}$ atoms/m$^{-2}$ for $^{237}$Np, were in agreement with the global fallout (GF) source term in the Southern Hemisphere, which was recognized as the main source of actinides to the region. A pattern was observed in the surface samples, with $^{237}$Np concentrations that decreased by 25-30% when moving from inshore to offshore stations, but such an effect could not be clearly discerned in the case of $^{236}$U within the data uncertainties. An explanation based on the larger particle reactivity of GF $^{237}$Np compared to GF $^{236}$U was proposed. Such an effect would have been important at the studied site due to the enhance presence of particles in the continental shelf triggered by the upwelling phenomenon. A value of $1.77 \pm 0.20$ was obtained for the $^{237}$Np/$^{236}$U atom ratio for the GF source term in the marine environment.</description>

      <title>Low-Loss Superconducting Resonators Fabricated from Tantalum Films Grown at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of $\alpha$-tantalum in superconducting circuits has enabled a considerable improvement of the coherence time of transmon qubits. The standard approach to grow $\alpha$-tantalum thin films on silicon involves heating the substrate, which takes several hours per deposition and prevents the integration of this material with wafers containing temperature-sensitive components. We report a detailed experimental study of an alternative growth method of $\alpha$-tantalum on silicon, which is achieved at room temperature through the use of a niobium seed layer. Despite a substantially higher density of oxygen-rich grain boundaries in the films sputtered at room temperature, resonators made from these films are found to have state-of-the-art quality factors, comparable to resonators fabricated from tantalum grown at high temperature. This finding challenges previous assumptions about correlations between material properties and microwave loss of superconducting thin films, and opens a new avenue for the integration of tantalum into fabrication flows with limited thermal budget.</description>

      <title>Isolation of $^{236}$U and $^{239,240}$Pu from seawater samples and its determination by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present and evaluate a radiochemical procedure optimised for the analysis of $^{236}$U and $^{239,240}$Pu in seawater samples by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The method is based on Fe(OH)$_3$ co-precipitation of actinides and uses TEVA and UTEVA extraction chromatography resins in a simplified way for the final U and Pu purification. In order to improve the performance of the method, the radiochemical yields are analysed in 1 to 10 L seawater volumes using alpha spectrometry (AS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Robust 80% plutonium recoveries are obtained; however, it is found that Fe(III) concentration in the precipitation solution and sample volume are the two critical and correlated parameters influencing the initial uranium extraction through Fe(OH)$_3$ co-precipitation. Therefore, we propose an expression that optimises the sample volume and Fe(III) amounts according to both the $^{236}$U and $^{239,240}$Pu concentrations in the samples and the performance parameters of the AMS facility. The method is validated for the current setup of the 1 MV AMS system (CNA, Sevilla, Spain), where He gas is used as a stripper, by analysing a set of intercomparison seawater samples, together with the Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics (ETH, Z\"urich, Switzerland).</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence in n-type GaAs unipolar nanoLEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the observation of electroluminescence (EL) at around 866 nm from n-i-n unipolar (electron-transporting) III-V GaAs nanoLEDs. The devices consist of nanopillars with top diameter of 166 nm, arranged in a 10x10 pillar array. Hole generation through impact ionization and Zener tunnelling is achieved by incorporating an AlAs/GaAs/AlAs double-barrier quantum well within the epilayer structure of the n-i-n diode. Time-resolved EL measurements reveal decay lifetimes larger than 300 ps, allowing us to estimate an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) higher than 2 per cent at sub-mA current injection. These results demonstrate the potential for a new class of n-type nanoscale light-emitting devices.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Argon Concentration within Insulating Glass Units using Low Frequency Ultrasonic Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insulating glass units (IGUs) account for over 30% of thermal transmission losses in building envelopes. To mitigate this, IGUs are often filled with low-conductivity gases like Argon. However, Argon concentration decreases over time due to IGU aging and manufacturing processes, which lessens their insulating effectiveness. This study presents a novel nondestructive methodology to quantify Argon concentration in IGUs using ultrasonic technique. The ultrasonic energy transmitted through the IGU is correlated with Argon concentration, validated through both experimental measurements and numerical models using COMSOL Multiphysics. The models simulate acoustic-structure interaction by adjusting gas density to reflect Argon presence, showing increased ultrasonic energy with higher Argon concentrations. Experimental measurements on two IGU samples with twenty Argon-air mixtures (ranging from 100% to 25% Argon) show that the proposed ultrasonic technique achieves a mean absolute error of 0.13, outperforming Spark Emission Spectroscopy and Helantec ISO-GAS-Control, which have errors of 2.31 and 0.33, respectively.</description>

      <title>A wideband amplifying and filtering reconfigurable intelligent surface for wireless relay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable metasurfaces have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves in real time, leading to the emergence of a prominent area in wireless communication, namely reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), to control the signal propagation and coverage. However, the existing RISs usually suffer from limited operating distance and band interference, which hinder their practical applications in wireless relay and communication systems. To overcome the limitations, we propose an amplifying and filtering RIS (AF-RIS) to enhance the in-band signal energy and filter the out-of-band signal of the incident EM waves, ensuring the miniaturization of the RIS array and enabling its anti-interference ability. In addition, each AF-RIS element is equipped with a 2-bit phase control capability, further endowing the entire array with great beamforming performance. An elaborately designed 4*8 AF-RIS array is presented by integrating the power dividing and combining networks, which substantially reduces the number of amplifiers and filters, thereby reducing the hardware costs and power consumption. Experimental results showcase the powerful capabilities of AF-RIS in beam-steering, frequency selectivity, and signal amplification. Therefore, the proposed AF-RIS holds significant promise for critical applications in wireless relay systems by offering an efficient solution to improve frequency selectivity, enhance signal coverage, and reduce hardware size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Ultra-rapid broadband mid-infrared spectral tuning and sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable mid-infrared lasers are essential for optical sensing and imaging. Existing technologies, however, face challenges in simultaneously achieving broadband spectral tunability and ultra-rapid scan rates, limiting their utility in dynamic scenarios such as real-time characterization of multiple molecular absorption bands. Here, we present a high-speed approach for broadband wavelength sweeping in the mid-infrared region, leveraging spectral focusing via difference frequency generation between a chirped fiber laser and an asynchronous, frequency-modulated electro-optic comb. This method enables pulse-to-pulse spectral tuning at a speed of 5.6 THz/us with 380 elements. Applied to spectroscopic sensing, our technique achieves broad spectral coverage (2600-3780 cm-1) with moderate spectral resolution (8 cm-1) and rapid acquisition times (6.3 us). Notably, the controllable electro-optic comb facilitates high scan rates of up to 2 Mscans/s across the full spectral range (corresponding to a speed of 60 THz/us), with trade-offs in number of elements (~30) and spectral point spacing or resolution (33 cm-1). Nevertheless, these capabilities make our platform highly promising for applications such as flow cytometry, chemical reaction monitoring, and mid-IR ranging and imaging.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous achievement of large anomalous Nernst effect and reduced thermal conductivity in sintered polycrystalline topological Heusler ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.</description>

      <title>Temporal refraction and reflection in modulated mechanical metabeams: theory and physical observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave reflection and refraction at a time interface follow different conservation laws compared to conventional scattering at a spatial interface. This study presents the experimental demonstration of refraction and reflection of flexural waves across a temporal boundary in a continuum based mechanical metabeam, and unveils opportunities that emerge by tailoring temporal scattering phenomena for phononic applications. We observe these phenomena in an elastic beam attached to an array of piezoelectric patches that can vary in time the effective elastic properties of the beam. Frequency conversion and phase conjugation are observed upon a single temporal interface. These results are consistent with the temporal Snell law and Fresnel equations for temporal interfaces. Further, we illustrate the manipulation of amplitude and frequency spectra of flexural wave temporal refraction and reflection through multi stepped temporal interfaces. Finally, by implementing a smooth time variation of wave impedance, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the capabilities of the temporal metabeam to realize waveform morphing and information coding. Our findings lay the foundation for developing time mechanical metamaterials and time phononic crystals, offering new avenues for advanced phonon manipulation in both wave amplitude and frequency</description>

      <title>First-principles study of electronic and magnetic properties of self-intercalated van der Waals magnet Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-intercalated van der Waals magnets, characterized by self-intercalating native atoms into van der Waals layered structures with intrinsic magnetism, exhibit a variety of novel physical properties. Here, using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we report a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which has a high Curie temperature of 492 K. We find that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is nearly half-metallic with a spin polarization reaching up to 90.9%. Due to the ferromagnetism and strong spin-orbit coupling effect in Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 138 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and 305 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ can be realized when its magnetization is along its magnetic easy axis and hard axis, respectively. By doping electrons (holes) into Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, these anomalous Hall conductivities can be increased up to 318 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ (648 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$). Interestingly, a 5-layer Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ thin film retains the room-temperature ferromagnetism with a higher spin polarization and larger anomalous Hall conductivity. Our work demonstrates that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is a novel room-temperature self-intercalated ferromagnet with high spin polarization and large anomalous Hall conductivity, offering great opportunities for designing nano-scale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Measurements of Cumulative Effects in Gas Dynamics Induced by High-Repetition-Rate Femtosecond Laser Filamentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-average-power, ultrafast ytterbium-based lasers allows us to generate laser filaments at repetition rates ranging from 10s of kHz up to 100s of kHz. At such high repetition rates, the inter-pulse time lies below the time required for the total diffusion of the deposited heat by each laser pulse, leading to cumulative hydrodynamic effects that have so far been rarely studied. Here, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental time-resolved measurements of these dynamics in air for laser repetition rates between 1 kHz and 100 kHz. We measure the change in the air refractive index caused by the localized heat deposition and the length of the filament-generated plasma channel, with which we can infer the corresponding change in air density. We observe that at repetition rates above 10 kHz, stationary density depletions with vanishing dynamics emerge. Our findings are of wide relevance for the fields of high-repetition-rate laser filamentation and its applications, as well as THz generation from laser-induced plasma sources.</description>

      <title>Purcell-Enhanced, Directional Light-Matter Interaction in a Waveguide-Coupled Nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically tunable, spin-dependent, directional coupling of single photons by embedding quantum dots (QDs) in a waveguide-coupled nanocavity. The directional behavior arises from direction-dependent interference between two cavity modes when coupled to the device waveguides. The small mode volume cavity enables simultaneous Purcell enhancement (${10.8\pm0.7}$) and peak directional contrast (${88\pm1\%}$), exceeding current state-of-the-art waveguide-only systems. We also present a scattering matrix model for the transmission through this structure, alongside a quantum trajectory-based model for predicting the system's directionality, which we use to explain the observed asymmetry in directional contrast seen in QD devices. Furthermore, the nanocavity enables wide-range electrical tuning of the emitter's directional contrast. We present results showing precise tuning of a QD emission line from a directional contrast of ${2\%}$ to ${96\%}$. In combination, these characteristics make this cavity-waveguide approach promising for use as a building block in directional nanophotonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Compact computer controlled biaxial tensile device for low-temperature transport measurements of layered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A biaxial tensile device for the transport study of layered materials is described. The device is mounted on the standard 24 pin zero force connector and can be moved between various setups. The compact design of the device makes it suitable for a wide range of studies. In our case, it is placed inside a 50 mm diameter chamber in the cryocooler and is used in the temperature range 9-310 K. A sample is glued in the center of a polyimide cruciform substrate, the ends of which are connected to a tension system driven by four computer-controlled stepper motors providing tensile force up to 30 N. Computer simulation results and their experimental verification show that tensile strain along one axis depends on the tensile load along the perpendicular direction, and this dependence turns out to be relatively strong and exceeds 40\%. The operation of the device is demonstrated by studying the effect of deformation on the electrical conductivity of the layered compound 2H-NbS2.</description>

      <title>Thermophotovoltaic performance metrics and techno-economics: efficiency vs. power density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are a promising new approach for converting heat to electricity. Their performance is primarily characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. While recent works have shown high efficiency, it is important to understand how both of these metrics impact the techno-economics of a TPV system as efforts to commercialize the technology advance. In this work, we develop the first unification of efficiency and power density into a single techno-economic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). We find that the LCOE can be broken into two parts: heating cost, including infrastructure and inputs for providing heat to the TPV cells, and cell cost, the capital cost of the TPV cells. We show that systems with high heating costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems with high cell costs should prioritize power density. We then develop a model to identify the most impactful cell properties in improving the important performance metric and reducing system LCOE. Namely, improving spectral control with increased back-surface reflectance is the most effective to reduce LCOE in systems with high infrastructural costs, while increasing the view factor and reducing front-surface reflectance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just one or two of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 25-75%, reaching competitive values ~ 8 cents/kWh-e, less than the average cost of electricity in the US. This study thus elucidates which TPV performance metric is more important for system technoeconomics and how to maximize it.</description>

      <title>Accurate Performance Characterization, Reporting, and Benchmarking for Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) provide a promising solution for powering Internet-of-Things smart devices, which has led to a surge in IPV research. However, the diverse lighting scenarios adopted in IPV studies pose unique challenges in characterization, reporting, and benchmarking, which may obscure genuine performance improvements and result in inaccurate conclusions due to characterization errors. This study provides a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of these challenges, investigating them through the experimental characterization of IPVs covering a broad performance parameter space, including c-Si, a-Si:H, perovskite, and organic devices. We reveal that many of these challenges can lead to unacceptable error levels in IPV performance parameters, with the angular interplay among the test light source, measuring device, and IPV being particularly detrimental under diffuse indoor illumination. To address these characterization challenges, we evaluate practical protocols to mitigate them. We additionally analyze different benchmarking protocols, revealing the strengths of the reference-cell method and the limitations and solutions related to the indoor spectral coincidence concept. To facilitate the implementation of these findings, we provide comprehensive characterization, reporting, and benchmarking checklists. By enabling reliable performance evaluation and benchmarking, we anticipate that our analyses and guidelines will stimulate further advancements in IPVs, facilitating the realization of their full potential.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity adjustable in-line high-temperature sensor based on metal microwire optical Fabry-Perot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) has been widely investigated as a potential temperature sensor. To function as a temperature sensor, the cavity of the FPI is typically constructed from either silica fibers or polymers. The silica cavity FPIs can function at temperatures exceeding 1000{\deg}C. However, its temperature sensitivity is constrained by its relatively low thermal optical coefficient and thermal expansion of silica materials. Although the polymer cavity FPI exhibits a high temperature sensitivity, its cavity is susceptible to deterioration in high-temperature environments. Here, to overcome this challenge and achieve high-sensitivity temperature sensing in a high-temperature environment, we propose a new type of temperature FPI sensor by inserting and sealing a section of Cr20Ni80 metal microwire inside a section of silica hollow core fiber (HCF) spliced to standard single-mode fiber (SMF). The FPIs exhibit a high degree of temperature sensitivity due to the high thermal expansion of the Cr20Ni80 metal microwire. Since the Cr20Ni80 metal has a high melting temperature of 1400{\deg}C, such FPIs can function in high-temperature environments. Moreover, the temperature sensitivity of this FPI can be modified without affecting its reflection spectrum by changing the length of the metallic microwire situated within the hollow core fiber. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FPIs exhibit a temperature sensitivity greater than -0.35nm/{\deg}C within the temperature range of 50{\deg}C to 440{\deg}C. Our proposed metal microwire-based FPIs are economical, robust, simple to fabricate, and capable of functioning in high-temperature environments, rendering them appealing options for practical applications</description>

      <title>Plasmonic excitations in graphene layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of fast charged particles with graphene layers can generate electromagnetic modes. This wake effect has been recently proposed for short-wavelength, high-gradient particle acceleration and for obtaining brilliant radiation sources. In this study, the excitation of wakefields produced by a point-like charged particle moving parallel to a multilayer graphene array (which may be supported by an insulated substrate) is studied using the linearized hydrodynamic theory. General expressions for the excited longitudinal and transverse wakefields have been derived. The dependencies of the wakefields on the positions of the layers and the substrate, the velocity and the surface density have been extensively analyzed. This study provides a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena underlying plasmonic excitations in graphene layers, paving the way for potential applications of these structures in particle acceleration, nanotechnology and materials science.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the readout of a superconducting qubit for repeated measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Readout of superconducting qubits faces a trade-off between measurement speed and unwanted back-action on the qubit caused by the readout drive, such as $T_1$ degradation and leakage out of the computational subspace. The readout is typically benchmarked by integrating the readout signal and choosing a binary threshold to extract the "readout fidelity". We show that readout fidelity may significantly overlook readout-induced leakage errors. Such errors are detrimental for applications that rely on continuously repeated measurements, e.g., quantum error correction. We introduce a method to measure the readout-induced leakage rate by repeatedly executing a composite operation - a readout preceded by a randomized qubit-flip. We apply this technique to characterize the readout of a superconducting qubit, optimized for fidelity across four different readout durations. Our technique highlights the importance of an independent leakage characterization by showing that the leakage rates vary from $0.12\%$ to $7.76\%$ across these readouts even though the fidelity exceeds $99.5\%$ in all four cases.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Efficient and Polarization-Diversity Fiber-Chip Coupling by 2D Grating Couplers with 193-nm DUV Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) diffraction gratings offer a polarization-independent coupling solution between the planar photonic chips and optical fibers, with advantages including placement flexibility, ease of fabrication, and tolerance to alignment errors. In this work, we first proposed and experimentally demonstrated a highly efficient 2D grating coupler enabled by exciting multipolar resonances through bi-level dielectric structures. A 70-nm shallow-etched hole array and a 160-nm-thick deposited polycrystalline silicon tooth array are employed in our proposed 2D grating coupler. Strong optical field confinement and enhanced radiation directionality can thus be attained through the use of 193-nm deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lithography, which is readily accessible from commercial silicon photonics foundries. The measured experimental peak coupling efficiency is -2.54 dB with a minimum feature size of 180 nm. Our design exhibits a 3-dB bandwidth of around 23.4 nm with good positioning tolerance for optical fibers. Due to the benefits of perfectly vertical coupling, the measured polarization-dependent loss in our experiments is below 0.3 dB within the 3-dB working bandwidth. Our proposed 2D grating structure and design method can also be applied to other integrated optics platforms, enabling an efficient and polarization-diversity coupling between optical fibers and photonic chips while reducing requirements on feature size.</description>
