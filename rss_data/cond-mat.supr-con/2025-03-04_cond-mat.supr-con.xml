      <title>Comment on 2501.17230 and 2502.00103 "Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO3 via the generalized Frohlich and deformation potential mechanisms" and "Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00041v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.</description>

      <title>A Study of Superconducting Behavior in Ruthenium Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium (Ru) is a promising candidate for the next-generation of electronic interconnects due to its low resistivity, small mean free path, and superior electromigration reliability at nanometer scales. Additionally, Ru exhibits superconductivity below 1 K, with resistance to oxidation, low diffusivity, and a small superconducting gap, making it a potential material for superconducting qubits and Josephson Junctions. Here, we investigate the superconducting behavior of Ru thin films (11.9 - 108.5 nm thick), observing transition temperatures from 657.9 mK to 557 mK. A weak thickness dependence appears in the thinnest films, followed by a conventional inverse thickness dependence in thicker films. Magnetotransport studies reveal type-II superconductivity in the dirty limit ({\xi} &gt;&gt; l), with coherence lengths ranging from 13.5 nm to 27 nm. Finally, oxidation resistance studies confirm minimal RuOx growth after seven weeks of air exposure. These findings provide key insights for integrating Ru into superconducting electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Condensation energy of superconducting BEC of non-interacting Cooper pairs in multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson-Fermion models of superconductivity are getting attention as they are able to explain some of the high temperature superconductor's properties. Here we report on the condensation energy of a 3D non-interacting mixture of paired fermions (electrons) as Cooper pairs assumed to be composite bosons, which are responsible for carrying superconductivity, plus unpaired fermions both trapped in a periodic multilayer structure like that of the cuasi-two dimensional High-Temperature superconductor planes, generated by applying an external Dirac's comb potential in the direction perpendicular to the planes where superconductivity preferably occurs, while in the other two directions parallel to the planes the mixture moves freely. For bosons we give the Bose-Einstein condensation critical temperature, which we assume is equal to the superconducting critical one, while for both bosons and fermions we give the chemical potential, the internal energy and the entropy, all of them as functions of temperature, in order to calculate the Helmholtz free energy, which we use to obtain the condensation energy of a mixture of $N_F$ ideal fermions (electrons), which after turning on the attractive pair interaction become $N_B = N_{F}/2$ ideal bosons. For several plane impenetrability magnitudes, we calculate the condensation energy as the difference between the free energies of the fermions which are in the normal state minus that of the bosons in the condensed state, where we observe that as the plane impenetrability increases: the condensation energy increases; the critical temperature decreases, as expected for example for cuprate superconductors, and the behavior of the entropy and the internal energy show a dimensional crossover from 3D to 2D.</description>

      <title>Insight into interplay between bandstructure and Coulomb interaction via quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference has been used frequently for the purpose of unraveling the electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level as well as the nature of superconducting gap in the unconventional superconductors. Using the metallic spin-density wave state of iron pnictides as an example, we demonstrate that the quasiparticle interference can also be used as a probe to provide crucial insight into the interplay of the electronic bandstructure and correlation effects in addition to bringing forth the essential features of electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Our study reveals that the features of quasiparticle interference pattern can help us narrowing down the interaction parameter window and choose a more realistic tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of topological surface states and superconductivity in Dirac semimetal NiTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of topological bands around the Fermi level ($E_F$) and superconductivity provides a fundamental platform for exploring their interplay. However, few materials inherently display both properties. In this study, we demonstrate the coexistence of topological surface states at the $E_F$ and superconductivity in NiTe$_2$ single crystals, a material hitherto not recognized as superconducting. Quasiparticle interference measurements performed via scanning tunneling microscopy suggest the presence of topological surface states at the $E_F$, which is further corroborated by density functional theory simulations. Experimental evidence for superconductivity is provided via electronic transport measurements and specific heat capacity analyses. Our results suggest that NiTe$_2$ represents a promising platform for investigating the rich interplay between topological states and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>"Half-Bogoliubons" as the intermediate states for the phase coherence in underdoped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity is achieved by the pairing of electrons and phase coherence between the Cooper pairs. According to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, the quasiparticles with Bogoliubov dispersion exists and reveal particle-hole symmetric coherence peaks on the single particle tunneling spectrum. Here we report the observation of two kinds of tunneling spectra showing only one side of the "coherence peak" but with symmetric energies (about +-11 meV) in underdoped cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6 single crystals (p=0.114) with fractional superconductivity. Merging these two kinds of spectra can mimic the complete Bogoliubov dispersion, thus we name the electronic states associated with these half-peaked spectrum as "half Bogoliubons". In previous studies, it was shown that two doped holes may bind into a local pair within the 4a0 x 4a0 plaquette of CuO bonds (a0: distance between nearest Cu atoms). We attribute the "half-Bogoliubons" to the intermediate states for the phase coherence, and they correspond to the three-hole and one-hole states as the excited ones from the local pairing state of two holes. An entanglement of these two "half-Bogoliubons" would mean the dynamic hopping of charge freedom resulting in the phase coherence between the local paired states. Our results unravel a unique process for establishing the phase coherence through exchanging a charge between the regions with local pairs.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform superconducting states caused by odd-frequency Cooper pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the origin of a nonuniform superconducting state in which Cooper pairs have a finite center of mass momentum. The instability to such a nonuniform superconducting state is analyzed by a pole of the pair fluctuation propagator for weak coupling superconductors. The results show that odd(even)-frequency Cooper pairs stabilize a nonuniform (uniform) superconducting phase below the transition temperature. We provide a theoretical framework that explains the reasons for appearing the nonuniform superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Determination of Mid-Infrared Refractive Indices of Superconducting Thin Films Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a technique to determine the mid-infrared refractive indices of thin superconducting films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In particular, we performed FTIR transmission and reflection measurements on 10-nm-thick NbN and 15-nm-thick MoSi films in the wavelength range of 2.5 to 25 $\mu$m, corresponding to frequencies of 12-120 THz or photon energies of 50-500 meV. To extract the mid-infrared refractive indices of the thin films from FTIR measurements, we used the Drude-Lorentz oscillator model to represent the dielectric functions of the films and implemented an optimization algorithm to fit these oscillator parameters, minimizing the error between the measured FTIR spectra and the simulated spectra calculated using the dielectric functions of the films. To evaluate the consistency of the extracted dielectric functions, we compared the refractive index values extrapolated from these dielectric functions in the UV to near-infrared wavelengths with the values separately measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. For further validation, we calculated the sheet resistance of the films from their extracted Drude oscillator parameters and compared with the experimental values. This FTIR-based refractive index measurement approach can be extended to measure the refractive indices of thin films at wavelengths beyond 25 $\mu$m, which will be useful for designing highly efficient photon detectors and photonic devices with enhanced optical absorption in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Competitive helical bands and highly efficient diode effect in F/S/TI/S/F hybrid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diode effect in superconducting materials has been actively investigated in recent years. Plenty of different devices have been proposed as a platform to observe the superconducting diode effect. In this work we discuss the possibility of a highly efficient superconducting diode design with controllable polarity. We propose the mesoscopic device that consists of two separated superconducting islands with proximity induced ferromagnetism deposited on top of the three-dimensional topological insulator. Using the quasiclassical formalism of the Usadel equations we demonstrate that the sign of the diode efficiency can be controlled by magnetization tuning of a single superconducting island. Moreover, we show that the diode efficiency can be substantially increased in such device. We argue that the dramatic increase of the diode efficiency is due to competing contribution of the two superconducting islands to the supercurrent with single helical bands linked through the topological insulator surface.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum superconductivity in two-dimensional altermagnets with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study finite-momentum superconductivity in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (RSOC). We show the phase diagrams obtained by solving a linearized gap equation, considering two directions of the N\'{e}el vector of the 2D altermagnet: parallel to the $xy$ plane (in-plane) and perpendicular to the $xy$ plane (out-of-plane). For the in-plane N\'{e}el vector, we find two different finite-momentum $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting states distinguished by a dominant pairing channel: an inter-band pairing or an intra-band pairing. Furthermore, it is shown that an anisotropic deformation of Fermi surfaces caused by spin-splitting effects due to the in-plane N\'{e}el vector and the RSOC can contribute to the stabilization of the finite-momentum superconductivity. We also perform the self-consistent calculations, and verify the existence of these superconducting states in addition to identifying other possible superconducting states and transition lines away from the phase boundary. For the out-of-plane N\'{e}el vector, the finite-momentum superconductivity is realized only in the inter-band pairing mechanism, which is in contrast to the in-plane case.</description>

      <title>Larger grains in high-Tc superconductors synthesized by the solid-state reaction route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state synthesis is widely used in exploratory research to study various structural modifications that affect the properties (critical temperature, critical current density, irreversibility field, etc.) of superconductors. The popularity of this method is due to its relative simplicity and availability of the necessary equipment. Combining solid-state synthesis and top-seeded melt growth allows us to increase the grain size in a Tm- and Nd-based 1-2-3 superconductor. Samples with a grain size up to 0.1 mm have been obtained. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and magnetization measurements have been used for investigating this superconducting material. The magnetization width {\Delta}M has increased significantly in the synthesized samples. However the temperature dependence of the intragrain critical current density and the pinning force scaling give evidences that the pinning mechanism in the obtained superconductor is essentially the same as in polycrystalline superconductors synthesized by standard solid-state technology. The increase in grain size in the synthesized samples is the main reason for the high values of {\Delta}M.</description>

Abstract: We study the BCS critical temperature on half-spaces in dimensions $d=1,2,3$ with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that the critical temperature on a half-space is strictly higher than on $\mathbb{R}^d$, at least at weak coupling in $d=1,2$ and weak coupling and small chemical potential in $d=3$. Furthermore, we show that the relative shift in critical temperature vanishes in the weak coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Many-Body Quantum Correlations in Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.</description>
