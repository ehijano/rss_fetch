      <title>Expected Return Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is an important inductive bias that can improve model robustness and generalization across many deep learning domains. In multi-agent settings, a priori known symmetries have been shown to address a fundamental coordination failure mode known as mutually incompatible symmetry breaking; e.g. in a game where two independent agents can choose to move "left'' or "right'', and where a reward of +1 or -1 is received when the agents choose the same action or different actions, respectively. However, the efficient and automatic discovery of environment symmetries, in particular for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes, remains an open problem. Furthermore, environmental symmetry breaking constitutes only one type of coordination failure, which motivates the search for a more accessible and broader symmetry class. In this paper, we introduce such a broader group of previously unexplored symmetries, which we call expected return symmetries, which contains environment symmetries as a subgroup. We show that agents trained to be compatible under the group of expected return symmetries achieve better zero-shot coordination results than those using environment symmetries. As an additional benefit, our method makes minimal a priori assumptions about the structure of their environment and does not require access to ground truth symmetries.</description>

      <title>Position: Towards a Responsible LLM-empowered Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Agent AI and Large Language Model-powered Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) has underscored the need for responsible and dependable system operation. Tools like LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation have expanded LLM capabilities, enabling deeper integration into MAS through enhanced knowledge retrieval and reasoning. However, these advancements introduce critical challenges: LLM agents exhibit inherent unpredictability, and uncertainties in their outputs can compound across interactions, threatening system stability. To address these risks, a human-centered design approach with active dynamic moderation is essential. Such an approach enhances traditional passive oversight by facilitating coherent inter-agent communication and effective system governance, allowing MAS to achieve desired outcomes more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Bottom-Up Reputation Promotes Cooperation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reputation serves as a powerful mechanism for promoting cooperation in multi-agent systems, as agents are more inclined to cooperate with those of good social standing. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods typically rely on predefined social norms to assign reputations, the question of how a population reaches a consensus on judgement when agents hold private, independent views remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a novel bottom-up reputation learning method, Learning with Reputation Reward (LR2), designed to promote cooperative behaviour through rewards shaping based on assigned reputation. Our agent architecture includes a dilemma policy that determines cooperation by considering the impact on neighbours, and an evaluation policy that assigns reputations to affect the actions of neighbours while optimizing self-objectives. It operates using local observations and interaction-based rewards, without relying on centralized modules or predefined norms. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of LR2 across various spatial social dilemma scenarios. Interestingly, we find that LR2 stabilizes and enhances cooperation not only with reward reshaping from bottom-up reputation but also by fostering strategy clustering in structured populations, thereby creating environments conducive to sustained cooperation.</description>

      <title>Dual Ensembled Multiagent Q-Learning with Hypernet Regularizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overestimation in single-agent reinforcement learning has been extensively studied. In contrast, overestimation in the multiagent setting has received comparatively little attention although it increases with the number of agents and leads to severe learning instability. Previous works concentrate on reducing overestimation in the estimation process of target Q-value. They ignore the follow-up optimization process of online Q-network, thus making it hard to fully address the complex multiagent overestimation problem. To solve this challenge, in this study, we first establish an iterative estimation-optimization analysis framework for multiagent value-mixing Q-learning. Our analysis reveals that multiagent overestimation not only comes from the computation of target Q-value but also accumulates in the online Q-network's optimization. Motivated by it, we propose the Dual Ensembled Multiagent Q-Learning with Hypernet Regularizer algorithm to tackle multiagent overestimation from two aspects. First, we extend the random ensemble technique into the estimation of target individual and global Q-values to derive a lower update target. Second, we propose a novel hypernet regularizer on hypernetwork weights and biases to constrain the optimization of online global Q-network to prevent overestimation accumulation. Extensive experiments in MPE and SMAC show that the proposed method successfully addresses overestimation across various tasks.</description>

      <title>An Agentic AI Workflow for Detecting Cognitive Concerns in Real-world Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early identification of cognitive concerns is critical but often hindered by subtle symptom presentation. This study developed and validated a fully automated, multi-agent AI workflow using LLaMA 3 8B to identify cognitive concerns in 3,338 clinical notes from Mass General Brigham. The agentic workflow, leveraging task-specific agents that dynamically collaborate to extract meaningful insights from clinical notes, was compared to an expert-driven benchmark. Both workflows achieved high classification performance, with F1-scores of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. The agentic workflow demonstrated improved specificity (1.00) and achieved prompt refinement in fewer iterations. Although both workflows showed reduced performance on validation data, the agentic workflow maintained perfect specificity. These findings highlight the potential of fully automated multi-agent AI workflows to achieve expert-level accuracy with greater efficiency, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for detecting cognitive concerns in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Containment Control Approach for Steering Opinion in a Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies the problem of steering multi-dimensional opinion in a social network. Assuming the society of desire consists of stubborn and regular agents, stubborn agents are considered as leaders who specify the desired opinion distribution as a distributed reward or utility function. In this context, each regular agent is seen as a follower, updating its bias on the initial opinion and influence weights by averaging their observations of the rewards their influencers have received. Assuming random graphs with reducible and irreducible topology specify the influences on regular agents, opinion evolution is represented as a containment control problem in which stability and convergence to the final opinion are proven.</description>

      <title>CH-MARL: Constrained Hierarchical Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Sustainable Maritime Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing global challenges such as greenhouse gas emissions and resource inequity demands advanced AI-driven coordination among autonomous agents. We propose CH-MARL (Constrained Hierarchical Multiagent Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that integrates hierarchical decision-making with dynamic constraint enforcement and fairness-aware reward shaping. CH-MARL employs a real-time constraint-enforcement layer to ensure adherence to global emission caps, while incorporating fairness metrics that promote equitable resource distribution among agents. Experiments conducted in a simulated maritime logistics environment demonstrate considerable reductions in emissions, along with improvements in fairness and operational efficiency. Beyond this domain-specific success, CH-MARL provides a scalable, generalizable solution to multi-agent coordination challenges in constrained, dynamic settings, thus advancing the state of the art in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>MAGNNET: Multi-Agent Graph Neural Network-based Efficient Task Allocation for Autonomous Vehicles with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of decentralized task allocation within heterogeneous multi-agent systems operating under communication constraints. We introduce a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, further enhanced by a tailored Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Our approach enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to dynamically allocate tasks efficiently without necessitating central coordination in a 3D grid environment. The framework minimizes total travel time while simultaneously avoiding conflicts in task assignments. For the cost calculation and routing, we employ reservation-based A* and R* path planners. Experimental results revealed that our method achieves a high 92.5% conflict-free success rate, with only a 7.49% performance gap compared to the centralized Hungarian method, while outperforming the heuristic decentralized baseline based on greedy approach. Additionally, the framework exhibits scalability with up to 20 agents with allocation processing of 2.8 s and robustness in responding to dynamically generated tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world applications in complex multi-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models, employed as multiple agents that interact and collaborate with each other, have excelled at solving complex tasks. The agents are programmed with prompts that declare their functionality, along with the topologies that orchestrate interactions across agents. Designing prompts and topologies for multi-agent systems (MAS) is inherently complex. To automate the entire design process, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the design space aiming to understand the factors behind building effective MAS. We reveal that prompts together with topologies play critical roles in enabling more effective MAS design. Based on the insights, we propose Multi-Agent System Search (MASS), a MAS optimization framework that efficiently exploits the complex MAS design space by interleaving its optimization stages, from local to global, from prompts to topologies, over three stages: 1) block-level (local) prompt optimization; 2) workflow topology optimization; 3) workflow-level (global) prompt optimization, where each stage is conditioned on the iteratively optimized prompts/topologies from former stages. We show that MASS-optimized multi-agent systems outperform a spectrum of existing alternatives by a substantial margin. Based on the MASS-found systems, we finally propose design principles behind building effective multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Voter Participation Control in Online Polls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: News outlets, surveyors, and other organizations often conduct polls on social networks to gain insights into public opinion. Such a poll is typically started by someone on a social network who sends it to her friends. If a person participates in the poll, the poll information gets published on her wall, which in turn enables her friends to participate, and the process continues. Eventually, a subset of the population participates in the poll, and the pollster learns the outcome of that poll. We initiate the study of a new but natural type of election control in such online elections.
  We study how difficult/easy it is to sway the outcome of such polls in one's favor/against (aka constructive vs destructive) by any malicious influencer who nudges/bribes people for seemingly harmless actions like non-participation. These questions are important from the standpoint of studying the power of resistance of online voting against malicious behavior. The destructive version is also important to quantify the robustness of the winner of an online voting. We show that both problems are computationally intractable even if the election is over only two candidates and the influencer has an infinite amount of money to spend (that is, every voter can be persuaded to not participate). We strengthen this result by proving that the computational task remains substantially challenging even if the underlying network is a tree. Finally, we show that there is a polynomial-time algorithm for the constructive version of the problem when we have O(1) candidates, and the treewidth of the underlying graph is O(1); the algorithm for the destructive version does not even need to assume O(1) number of candidates. Hence, we observe that the destructive version is computationally easier than the constructive version.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Cruising: Reinforcement Learning-Based Time-Headway Control for Increased Traffic Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of connected automated vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a potentially practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</description>

      <title>CAMP: Collaborative Attention Model with Profiles for Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The profiled vehicle routing problem (PVRP) is a generalization of the heterogeneous capacitated vehicle routing problem (HCVRP) in which the objective is to optimize the routes of vehicles to serve client demands subject to different vehicle profiles, with each having a preference or constraint on a per-client basis. While existing learning methods have shown promise for solving the HCVRP in real-time, no learning method exists to solve the more practical and challenging PVRP. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Attention Model with Profiles (CAMP), a novel approach that learns efficient solvers for PVRP using multi-agent reinforcement learning. CAMP employs a specialized attention-based encoder architecture to embed profiled client embeddings in parallel for each vehicle profile. We design a communication layer between agents for collaborative decision-making across profiled embeddings at each decoding step and a batched pointer mechanism to attend to the profiled embeddings to evaluate the likelihood of the next actions. We evaluate CAMP on two variants of PVRPs: PVRP with preferences, which explicitly influence the reward function, and PVRP with zone constraints with different numbers of agents and clients, demonstrating that our learned solvers achieve competitive results compared to both classical state-of-the-art neural multi-agent models in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. We make our code openly available at https://github.com/ai4co/camp.</description>

      <title>Layered Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Multi-Agent LLM Systems: A Comprehensive Approach to Explainable Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to provide step-by-step rationales, improving performance on complex tasks. Despite its benefits, vanilla CoT often fails to fully verify intermediate inferences and can produce misleading explanations. In this work, we propose Layered Chain-of-Thought (Layered-CoT) Prompting, a novel framework that systematically segments the reasoning process into multiple layers, each subjected to external checks and optional user feedback. We expand on the key concepts, present three scenarios -- medical triage, financial risk assessment, and agile engineering -- and demonstrate how Layered-CoT surpasses vanilla CoT in terms of transparency, correctness, and user engagement. By integrating references from recent arXiv papers on interactive explainability, multi-agent frameworks, and agent-based collaboration, we illustrate how Layered-CoT paves the way for more reliable and grounded explanations in high-stakes domains.</description>
