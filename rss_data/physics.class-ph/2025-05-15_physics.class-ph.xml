      <title>Classical Dirac particle I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we produce a classical Lagrangian description of an elementary spinning particle which satisfies Dirac equation when quantized. We call this particle a classical Dirac particle. We analyze in detail the way we arrive to this model and how the different observables and constants of the motion can be expressed in terms of the degrees of freedom and their derivatives, by making use of Noether's theorem. The main feature is that the particle has a center of charge r, moving at the speed of light, that satisfies fourth-order diferential equations and all observables can be expressed only in terms of this point and their time derivatives. The particle has also a center of mass q, that is a different point than the center of charge. This implies that two different spin observables can be defined, one S with respect to the point r and another SCM with respect to the point q, that satisfy different dynamical equations. The spin S satisfies the same dynamical equation than Dirac's spin operator. The fourth-order differential equations for the point r can be transformed into a system of second-order ordinary differential equations for the center of charge and center of mass. The dynamics can be described in terms of dimensionless variables. The possible interaction Lagrangians are described and we devote the main part of the work to the electromagnetic interaction of the Dirac particle with uniform and oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The numerical integrations of the dynamical equations are performed with different Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested reader.</description>

      <title>The amplitude decay of a harmonic oscillator damped simultaneously by weak linear and nonlinear damping forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive approximate expressions for the amplitude decay of harmonic oscillations weakly damped by the simultaneous action of three different damping forces: force of constant magnitude, force linear in velocity, and force quadratic in velocity. Our derivation is based on a basic understanding of the undamped harmonic oscillator and the connection between the energy dissipation rate and the power of the total damping force. By comparing our approximate analytical solutions with the corresponding numerical solutions, we find that our solutions excellently describe the dynamics of the oscillator in the regime of weak damping by combinations of these three forces for an experimentally relevant range of corresponding damping constants. The physical concepts and mathematical techniques we employ are suitable for undergraduate physics teaching.</description>
