      <title>Experimental Study of Decentralized Robot Network Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization and desynchronization in networks is a highly studied topic in many electrical systems, but there is a distinct lack of research on this topic with respect to robotics. Creating an effective decentralized synchronization algorithm for a robotic network would allow multiple robots to work together to achieve a task and would be able to adapt to the addition or loss of robots in real-time. The purpose of this study is to improve algorithms implemented developed by the authors for this purpose and experimentally evaluate these methods. The most effective algorithm for synchronization and desynchronization found in a former study were modified to improve testing and vary its methods of calculation. A multi-robot platform composed of multiple Roomba robots was used in the experimental study. Observation of data showed how adjusting parameters of the algorithms affected both the time to reach a desired state of synchronization or desynchronization and how the network maintained this state. Testing three different methods on each algorithm showed differing results. Future work in cooperative robotics will likely see success using these algorithms to accomplish a variety of tasks.</description>

      <title>A game theory analysis of decentralized epidemic management with opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a static game that allows one to numerically assess the loss of efficiency induced by decentralized control or management of a global epidemic. Each player represents a region which is assumed to choose its control to implement a tradeoff between socio-economic aspects and health aspects; the control comprises both epidemic control physical measures and influence actions on the region opinion. The Generalized Nash equilibrium $(\mathrm{GNE})$ analysis of the proposed game model is conducted. The direct analysis of this game of practical interest is non-trivial but it turns out that one can construct an auxiliary game which allows one: to prove existence and uniqueness; to compute the GNE and the optimal centralized solution (sum-cost) of the game. These results allow us to assess numerically the loss (measured in terms of Price of Anarchy ($\mathrm{PoA}$)) induced by decentralization with or without taking into account the opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Control Density Function for Robust Safety and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for safe control design based on the density function. A control density function (CDF) is introduced to synthesize a safe controller for a nonlinear dynamic system. The CDF can be viewed as a dual to the control barrier function (CBF), a popular approach used for safe control design. While the safety certificate using the barrier function is based on the notion of invariance, the dual certificate involving the density function has a physical interpretation of occupancy. This occupancy-based physical interpretation is instrumental in providing an analytical construction of density function used for safe control synthesis. The safe control design problem is formulated using the density function as a quadratic programming (QP) problem. In contrast to the QP proposed for control synthesis using CBF, the proposed CDF-based QP can combine both the safety and convergence conditions to target state into single constraints. Further, we consider robustness against uncertainty in system dynamics and the initial condition and provide theoretical results for robust navigation using the CDF. Finally, we present simulation results for safe navigation with single integrator and double-gyre fluid flow-field examples, followed by robust navigation using the bicycle model and autonomous lane-keeping examples.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Estimation of Real Valued Function by Two Agents and a Fusion Center with Knowledge Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a collaborative iterative algorithm with two agents and a fusion center for estimation of a real valued function (or ``model") on the set of real numbers. While the data collected by the agents is private, in every iteration of the algorithm, the models estimated by the agents are uploaded to the fusion center, fused, and, subsequently downloaded by the agents. We consider the estimation spaces at the agents and the fusion center to be Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Under suitable assumptions on these spaces, we prove that the algorithm is consistent, i.e., there exists a subsequence of the estimated models which converges to a model in the strong topology. To this end, we define estimation operators for the agents, fusion center, and, for every iteration of the algorithm constructively. We define valid input data sequences, study the asymptotic properties of the norm of the estimation operators, and, find sufficient conditions under which the estimation operator until any iteration is uniformly bounded. Using these results, we prove the existence of an estimation operator for the algorithm which implies the consistency of the considered estimation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model predictive control of battery storage units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many state-of-the-art control approaches for power systems with storage units, an explicit model of the storage dynamics is required. With growing numbers of storage units, identifying these dynamics can be cumbersome. This paper employs recent data-driven control approaches that do not require an explicit identification step. Instead, they use measured input/output data in control formulations. In detail, we propose an economic data-driven model predictive control (MPC) scheme to operate a small power system with input-nonlinear battery dynamics. First, a linear data-driven MPC approach that uses a slack variable to account for plant-model-mismatch is proposed. In a second step, an input-nonlinear data-driven MPC scheme is deduced. Comparisons with a reference indicate that the linear data-driven MPC approximates the nonlinear plant in an acceptable manner. Even better results, however, can be obtained with the input-nonlinear data-driven MPC scheme which provides increased prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Deception in Nash Equilibrium Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In socio-technical multi-agent systems, deception exploits privileged information to induce false beliefs in "victims," keeping them oblivious and leading to outcomes detrimental to them or advantageous to the deceiver. We consider model-free Nash-equilibrium-seeking for non-cooperative games with asymmetric information and introduce model-free deceptive algorithms with stability guarantees. In the simplest algorithm, the deceiver includes in his action policy the victim's exploration signal, with an amplitude tuned by an integrator of the regulation error between the deceiver's actual and desired payoff. The integral feedback drives the deceiver's payoff to the payoff's reference value, while the victim is led to adopt a suboptimal action, at which the pseudogradient of the deceiver's payoff is zero. The deceiver's and victim's actions turn out to constitute a "deceptive" Nash equilibrium of a different game, whose structure is managed - in real time - by the deceiver. We examine quadratic, aggregative, and more general games and provide conditions for a successful deception, mutual and benevolent deception, and immunity to deception. Stability results are established using techniques based on averaging and singular perturbations. Among the examples in the paper is a microeconomic duopoly in which the deceiver induces in the victim a belief that the buyers disfavor the deceiver more than they actually do, leading the victim to increase the price above the Nash price, and resulting in an increased profit for the deceiver and a decreased profit for the victim. A study of the deceiver's integral feedback for the desired profit reveals that, in duopolies with equal marginal costs, a deceiver that is greedy for very high profit can attain any such profit, and pursue this with arbitrarily high integral gain (impatiently), irrespective of the market preference for the victim.</description>

      <title>Channel Characterization of IRS-assisted Resonant Beam Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the growing demand for data traffic, spectrum-rich optical wireless communication (OWC) has emerged as a key technological driver for the development of 6G. The resonant beam communication (RBC) system, which employs spatially separated laser cavities as the transmitter and receiver, is a high-speed OWC technology capable of self-alignment without tracking. However, its transmission through the air is susceptible to losses caused by obstructions. In this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted RBC system with the optical frequency doubling method, where the resonant beam in frequency-fundamental and frequency-doubled is transmitted through both direct line-of-sight (LoS) and IRS-assisted channels to maintain steady-state oscillation and enable communication without echo-interference, respectively. Then, we establish the channel model based on Fresnel diffraction theory under the near-field optical propagation to analyze the transmission loss and frequency-doubled power analytically. Furthermore, communication power can be maximized by dynamically controlling the beam-splitting ratio between the two channels according to the loss levels encountered over air. Numerical results validate that the IRS-assisted channel can compensate for the losses in the obstructed LoS channel and misaligned receivers, ensuring that communication performance reaches an optimal value with dynamic ratio adjustments.</description>

      <title>Wastewater Treatment Plant Data for Nutrient Removal System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Agtrup (BlueKolding) dataset, collected from Denmark's Agtrup wastewater treatment plant, specifically designed to enhance phosphorus removal via chemical and biological methods. This rich dataset is assembled through a high-frequency Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system data collection process, which captures a wide range of variables related to the operational dynamics of nutrient removal. It comprises time-series data featuring measurements sampled to a frequency of two minutes across various control, process, and environmental variables. The comprehensive dataset aims to foster significant advancements in wastewater management by supporting the development of sophisticated predictive models and optimizing operational strategies. By providing detailed insights into the interactions and efficiencies of chemical and biological phosphorus removal processes, the dataset serves as a vital resource for environmental researchers and engineers focused on improving the sustainability and effectiveness of wastewater treatment operations. The ultimate goal of this dataset is to facilitate the creation of digital twins and the application of machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning, to predict and enhance system performance under varying operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Neural Optimizers: A Permutation Equivariant Neural Approximation for Information Processing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexities of information processing across Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems drive the development and adoption of Artificial Intelligence-based optimization solutions. Traditional solvers often suffer from slow response times and an inability to adapt swiftly to real-time input variations. To address these deficiencies, we will expand on our previous research in neural-based optimizers by introducing a machine learning-enabled neural approximation model called LOOP-PE (Learning to Optimize the Optimization Process -- Permutation Equivariance version). This model not only enhances decision-making efficiency but also dynamically adapts to variations of data collections from sensor networks. In this work, we focus on mitigating the heterogeneity issues of data collection from sensor networks, including sensor dropout and failures, communication delays, and the complexities involved in integrating new sensors during system scaling. The proposed LOOP-PE model specifically overcomes these issues with a unique structure that is permutation equivariant, allowing it to accommodate inputs from a varying number of sensors and directly linking these inputs to their optimal operational outputs. This design significantly boosts the system's flexibility and adaptability, especially in scenarios characterized by unordered, distributed, and asynchronous data collections. Moreover, our approach increases the robustness of decision-making by integrating physical constraints through the generalized gauge map method, which theoretically ensures the decisions' practical feasibility and operational viability under dynamic conditions. We use a DDDAS case study to demonstrate that LOOP-PE model reliably delivers near-optimal and adaptable solutions, significantly outperforming traditional methods in managing the complexities of multi-sensor environments for real-time deployments.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Nonlinear Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shida-Jiang/A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters.</description>

      <title>Time Series Dataset for Modeling and Forecasting of $N_2O$ in Wastewater Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two years of high-resolution nitrous oxide ($N_2O$) measurements for time series modeling and forecasting in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The dataset comprises frequent, real-time measurements from a full-scale WWTP, with a sample interval of 2 minutes, making it ideal for developing models for real-time operation and control. This comprehensive bio-chemical dataset includes detailed influent and effluent parameters, operational conditions, and environmental factors. Unlike existing datasets, it addresses the unique challenges of modeling $N_2O$, a potent greenhouse gas, providing a valuable resource for researchers to enhance predictive accuracy and control strategies in wastewater treatment processes. Additionally, this dataset significantly contributes to the fields of machine learning and deep learning time series forecasting by serving as a benchmark that mirrors the complexities of real-world processes, thus facilitating advancements in these domains. We provide a detailed description of the dataset along with a statistical analysis to highlight its characteristics, such as nonstationarity, nonnormality, seasonality, heteroscedasticity, structural breaks, asymmetric distributions, and intermittency, which are common in many real-world time series datasets and pose challenges for forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Identification in Mobile Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks heralds a transformative era for mobile communication, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies like Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) is paramount in addressing the burgeoning demands for energy efficiency, high data rates, reliable connectivity, and enhanced coverage in densely populated areas. RISs have attracted the attention of academia as well as the industry and emerged as a beacon of innovation, offering a novel paradigm to reconfigure the wireless propagation environment beneficially, thereby enhancing the overall network performance. It is envisioned that the deployment of numerous RISs in a mobile network will serve user equipments (UEs) to boost various key performance indicators (KPIs), with lower energy consumption compared to alternative solutions (e.g., relays, and network-controlled repeaters). However, the knowledge of whether or not a UE is being served through an RIS and if so, which RIS it is being served by is crucial and beneficial for various network planning and operational reasons. In this paper, we address the importance and the benefits of RIS identification in a mobile network. Additionally, we guide the readers and researchers by introducing alternative methods to enable RIS identification. Through the lens of this research, we unveil and shed light to various benefits, the challenges, and future opportunities in the identification of RISs serving mobile users in complex network environments, highlighting the necessity for advanced identification strategies to fully harness the potential of RIS technology in next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>The Reachability Problem for Neural-Network Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A control system consists of a plant component and a controller which periodically computes a control input for the plant. We consider systems where the controller is implemented by a feedforward neural network with ReLU activations. The reachability problem asks, given a set of initial states, whether a set of target states can be reached. We show that this problem is undecidable even for trivial plants and fixed-depth neural networks with three inputs and outputs. We also show that the problem becomes semi-decidable when the plant as well as the input and target sets are given by automata over infinite words.</description>

      <title>ProACT: An Augmented Reality Testbed for Intelligent Prosthetic Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upper-limb amputees face tremendous difficulty in operating dexterous powered prostheses. Previous work has shown that aspects of prosthetic hand, wrist, or elbow control can be improved through "intelligent" control, by combining movement-based or gaze-based intent estimation with low-level robotic autonomy. However, no such solutions exist for whole-arm control. Moreover, hardware platforms for advanced prosthetic control are expensive, and existing simulation platforms are not well-designed for integration with robotics software frameworks. We present the Prosthetic Arm Control Testbed (ProACT), a platform for evaluating intelligent control methods for prosthetic arms in an immersive (Augmented Reality) simulation setting. Using ProACT with non-amputee participants, we compare performance in a Box-and-Blocks Task using a virtual myoelectric prosthetic arm, with and without intent estimation. Our results show that methods using intent estimation improve both user satisfaction and the degree of success in the task. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first study of semi-autonomous control for complex whole-arm prostheses, the first study including sequential task modeling in the context of wearable prosthetic arms, and the first testbed of its kind. Towards the goal of supporting future research in intelligent prosthetics, the system is built upon on existing open-source frameworks for robotics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Stiffness: A Biomimetic Robotic System with Tensegrity-Based Compliant Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomimicry has played a pivotal role in robotics. In contrast to rigid robots, bio-inspired robots exhibit an inherent compliance, facilitating versatile movements and operations in constrained spaces. The robot implementation in fabrication, however, has posed technical challenges and mechanical complexity, thereby underscoring a noticeable gap between research and practice. To address the limitation, the research draws inspiration from the unique musculoskeletal feature of vertebrate physiology, which displays significant capabilities for sophisticated locomotion. The research converts the biological paradigm into a tensegrity-based robotic system, which is formed by the design of rigid-flex coupling and a compliant mechanism. This integrated technique enables the robot to achieve a wide range of motions with variable stiffness and adaptability, holding great potential for advanced performance in ill-defined environments. In summation, the research aims to provide a robust foundation for tensegrity-based biomimetic robots in practice, enhancing the feasibility of undertaking intricate robotic constructions.</description>

      <title>BiRoDiff: Diffusion policies for bipedal robot locomotion on unseen terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locomotion on unknown terrains is essential for bipedal robots to handle novel real-world challenges, thus expanding their utility in disaster response and exploration. In this work, we introduce a lightweight framework that learns a single walking controller that yields locomotion on multiple terrains. We have designed a real-time robot controller based on diffusion models, which not only captures multiple behaviours with different velocities in a single policy but also generalizes well for unseen terrains. Our controller learns with offline data, which is better than online learning in aspects like scalability, simplicity in training scheme etc. We have designed and implemented a diffusion model-based policy controller in simulation on our custom-made Bipedal Robot model named Stoch BiRo. We have demonstrated its generalization capability and high frequency control step generation relative to typical generative models, which require huge onboarding compute.</description>

      <title>Hidden Convexity-Based Distributed Operation of Integrated Electricity-Gas Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hidden convexity-based method to address distributed optimal energy flow (OEF) problems for transmission-level integrated electricity-gas systems. First, we develop a node-wise decoupling method to de-compose an OEF problem into multiple OEF subproblems. Then, we propose a hidden convexity-based method to equivalently reformulate nonconvex OEF subproblems as semi-definite programs. This method differs from any ap-proximation and convexification methods that may incur infeasible solutions. Since all OEF subproblems are origi-nally convex or equivalently convexified, we adopt an ADMM to solve the hidden convexity-based distributed OEF problem with convergence analysis. Test results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in handling a large number of agents.</description>

      <title>AIRA: A Low-cost IR-based Approach Towards Autonomous Precision Drone Landing and NLOS Indoor Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic drone landing is an important step for achieving fully autonomous drones. Although there are many works that leverage GPS, video, wireless signals, and active acoustic sensing to perform precise landing, autonomous drone landing remains an unsolved challenge for palm-sized microdrones that may not be able to support the high computational requirements of vision, wireless, or active audio sensing. We propose AIRA, a low-cost infrared light-based platform that targets precise and efficient landing of low-resource microdrones. AIRA consists of an infrared light bulb at the landing station along with an energy efficient hardware photodiode (PD) sensing platform at the bottom of the drone. AIRA costs under 83 USD, while achieving comparable performance to existing vision-based methods at a fraction of the energy cost. AIRA requires only three PDs without any complex pattern recognition models to accurately land the drone, under $10$cm of error, from up to $11.1$ meters away, compared to camera-based methods that require recognizing complex markers using high resolution images with a range of only up to $1.2$ meters from the same height. Moreover, we demonstrate that AIRA can accurately guide drones in low light and partial non line of sight scenarios, which are difficult for traditional vision-based approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on vessel automation and autonomy is currently being conducted by various countries and institutions. Safe and accurate ship control algorithms are crucial to realize automated operation. Actuator drive constraints of a target ship may jeopardize the stability of the control law and require complex theory. In this study, we include a penalty term to the control law gain optimization stage of dynamic positioning systems to account for the amounts by which the actuator input value and its rate of change exceed the constraint. The parameters for generating a suitable reference path for the control law are identified simultaneously with the control gains. The simulation results show that the proposed method can realize control parameters and a reference design with excellent tracking performance while determining the cost of the controller design by considering the effects of both the actuators and rate saturation.</description>

Abstract: The Kalman filter is indispensable for state estimation across diverse fields but faces computational challenges with higher dimensions. Approaches such as Riccati equation approximations aim to alleviate this complexity, yet ensuring properties like bounded errors remains challenging. Yamada and Ohki introduced low-rank Kalman-Bucy filters for continuous-time systems, ensuring bounded errors. This paper proposes a discrete-time counterpart of the low-rank filter and shows its system theoretic properties and conditions for bounded mean square error estimation. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Secret and Covert Communications for Multi-User Multi-Antenna Uplink UAV Systems: Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by diverse secure requirements of multi-user in UAV systems, we propose a collaborative secret and covert transmission method for multi-antenna ground users to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Specifically, based on the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), two ground users with distinct security requirements, named Bob and Carlo, superimpose their signals and transmit the combined signal to the UAV named Alice. An adversary Willie attempts to simultaneously eavesdrop Bob's confidential message and detect whether Carlo is transmitting or not. We derive close-form expressions of the secrecy connection probability (SCP) and the covert connection probability (CCP) to evaluate the link reliability for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. Furthermore, we bound the secrecy outage probability (SOP) from Bob to Alice and the detection error probability (DEP) of Willie to evaluate the link security for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. To characterize the theoretical benchmark of the above model, we formulate a weighted multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the average of secret and covert transmission rates subject to constraints SOP, DEP, the beamformers of Bob and Carlo, and UAV trajectory parameters. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent (SCA-BCD) methods. Our results reveal the influence of design parameters of the system on the wiretap and covert rates, analytically and numerically. In summary, our study fills the gaps in joint secret and covert transmission for multi-user multi-antenna uplink UAV communications and provides insights to construct such systems.</description>

Abstract: The problem of finite/fixed-time cooperative state estimation is considered for a class of quasilinear systems with nonlinearities satisfying a H\"older condition. A strongly connected nonlinear distributed observer is designed under the assumption of global observability. By proper parameter tuning with linear matrix inequalities, the observer error equation possesses finite/fixed-time stability in the perturbation-free case and input-to-state stability with respect to bounded perturbations. Numerical simulations are performed to validate this design.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis of Multi-task Representation Learning for Linear-Quadratic Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation learning is a powerful tool that enables learning over large multitudes of agents or domains by enforcing that all agents operate on a shared set of learned features. However, many robotics or controls applications that would benefit from collaboration operate in settings with changing environments and goals, whereas most guarantees for representation learning are stated for static settings. Toward rigorously establishing the benefit of representation learning in dynamic settings, we analyze the regret of multi-task representation learning for linear-quadratic control. This setting introduces unique challenges. Firstly, we must account for and balance the $\textit{misspecification}$ introduced by an approximate representation. Secondly, we cannot rely on the parameter update schemes of single-task online LQR, for which least-squares often suffices, and must devise a novel scheme to ensure sufficient improvement. We demonstrate that for settings where exploration is "benign", the regret of any agent after $T$ timesteps scales as $\tilde O(\sqrt{T/H})$, where $H$ is the number of agents. In settings with "difficult" exploration, the regret scales as $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{d_u d_\theta} \sqrt{T} + T^{3/4}/H^{1/5})$, where $d_x$ is the state-space dimension, $d_u$ is the input dimension, and $d_\theta$ is the task-specific parameter count. In both cases, by comparing to the minimax single-task regret $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{d_x d_u^2}\sqrt{T})$, we see a benefit of a large number of agents. Notably, in the difficult exploration case, by sharing a representation across tasks, the effective task-specific parameter count can often be small $d_\theta &lt; d_x d_u$. Lastly, we provide numerical validation of the trends we predict.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the class of nonlinear input-affine systems with polynomial dynamics, we consider the problem of designing an input-to-state stabilizing controller with respect to typical exogenous signals in a feedback control system, such as actuator and process disturbances. We address this problem in a data-based setting when we cannot avail ourselves of the dynamics of the actual system, but only of data generated by it under unknown bounded noise. For all dynamics consistent with data, we derive sum-of-squares programs to design an input-to-state stabilizing controller, an input-to-state Lyapunov function and the corresponding comparison functions. This numerical design for input-to-state stabilization seems to be relevant not only in the considered data-based setting, but also in a model-based setting. Illustration of feasibility of the provided sum-of-squares programs is provided on a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Delay-Aware Robust Edge Network Hardening Under Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing promises to offer low-latency and ubiquitous computation to numerous devices at the network edge. For delay-sensitive applications, link delays can have a direct impact on service quality. These delays can fluctuate drastically over time due to various factors such as network congestion, changing traffic conditions, cyberattacks, component failures, and natural disasters. Thus, it is crucial to efficiently harden the edge network to mitigate link delay variation as well as ensure a stable and improved user experience. To this end, we propose a novel robust model for optimal edge network hardening, considering the link delay uncertainty. Departing from the existing literature that treats uncertainties as exogenous, our model incorporates an endogenous uncertainty set to properly capture the impact of hardening and workload allocation decisions on link delays. However, the endogenous set introduces additional complexity to the problem due to the interdependence between decisions and uncertainties. We present two efficient methods to transform the problem into a solvable form. Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12561v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To identify a stationary action profile for a population of competitive agents, each executing private strategies, we introduce a novel active-learning scheme where a centralized external observer (or entity) can probe the agents' reactions and recursively update simple local parametric estimates of the action-reaction mappings. Under very general working assumptions (not even assuming that a stationary profile exists), sufficient conditions are established to assess the asymptotic properties of the proposed active learning methodology so that, if the parameters characterizing the action-reaction mappings converge, a stationary action profile is achieved. Such conditions hence act also as certificates for the existence of such a profile. Extensive numerical simulations involving typical competitive multi-agent control and decision-making problems illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed learning-based approach.</description>

Abstract: We derive direct data-driven dissipativity analysis methods for Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems using a single sequence of input-scheduling-output data. By means of constructing a semi-definite program subject to linear matrix inequality constraints based on this data-dictionary, direct data-driven verification of $(Q,S,R)$-type of dissipativity properties of the data-generating LPV system is achieved. Multiple implementation methods are proposed to achieve efficient computational properties and to even exploit structural information on the scheduling, e.g., rate bounds. The effectiveness and trade-offs of the proposed methodologies are shown in simulation studies of academic and physically realistic examples.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning based Joint Sleep and Power Control in RIS-aided Energy-Efficient RAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy efficiency (EE) is one of the most important metrics for envisioned 6G networks, and sleep control, as a cost-efficient approach, can significantly lower power consumption by switching off network devices selectively. Meanwhile, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technique to enhance the EE of future wireless networks. In this work, we jointly consider sleep and transmission power control for RIS-aided energy-efficient networks. In particular, considering the timescale difference between sleep control and power control, we introduce a cooperative hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (Co-HDRL) algorithm, enabling hierarchical and intelligent decision-making. Specifically, the meta-controller in Co-HDRL uses cross-entropy metrics to evaluate the policy stability of sub-controllers, and sub-controllers apply the correlated equilibrium to select optimal joint actions. Compared with conventional HDRL, Co-HDRL enables more stable high-level policy generations and low-level action selections. Then, we introduce a fractional programming method for RIS phase-shift control, maximizing the sum-rate under a given transmission power. In addition, we proposed a low-complexity surrogate optimization method as a baseline for RIS control. Finally, simulations show that the RIS-assisted sleep control can achieve more than 16\% lower energy consumption and 30\% higher EE than baseline algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Non-parametric representations of dynamical systems based on the image of a Hankel matrix of data are extensively used for data-driven control. However, if samples of data are missing, obtaining such representations becomes a difficult task. By exploiting the kernel structure of Hankel matrices of irregularly measured data generated by a linear time-invariant system, we provide computational methods for which any complete finite-length behavior of the system can be obtained. For the special case of periodically missing outputs, we provide conditions on the input such that the former result is guaranteed. In the presence of noise in the data, our method returns an approximate finite-length behavior of the system. We illustrate our result with several examples, including its use for approximate data completion in real-world applications and compare it to alternative methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameter identifiability problem for a dynamical system is to determine whether the parameters of the system can be found from data for the outputs of the system. Verifying whether the parameters are identifiable is a necessary first step before a meaningful parameter estimation can take place. Non-identifiability occurs in practical models. To reparametrize a model to achieve identifiability is a challenge. The existing approaches have been shown to be useful for many important examples. However, these approaches are either limited to linear models and scaling parametrizations or are not guaranteed to find a reparametrization even if it exists. In the present paper, we prove that there always exists a locally identifiable model with the same input-output behaviour as the original one obtained from a given one by a partial specialization of the parameters. As an extra feature of our approach, the resulting (at least) locally identifiable reparameterization has the same shape: the monomials in the new state variables in the new model are formed in the same way as in the original model. Furthermore, we give a sufficient observability condition for the existence of a state space transformation from the original model to the new one. Our proof is constructive and can be translated to an algorithm, which we illustrate by several examples.</description>

      <title>Efficient MPC for Emergency Evasive Maneuvers, Part II: Comparative Assessment for Hybrid Control</title>

Abstract: Optimization-based approaches such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are promising approaches in proactive control for safety-critical applications with changing environments such as automated driving systems. However, the computational complexity of the MPC optimization problem coupled with the need for real-time control in hazardous scenarios is the main bottleneck in realization of automation levels four and five for driving systems. In this paper, we construct hybrid formulations of the nonlinear MPC problem for tracking control during emergency evasive maneuvers and assess their computational efficiency in terms of accuracy and solution time. To hybridize the MPC problem, we combine three hybrid approximations of the prediction model and four approximations of the nonlinear stability and tire saturation constraints and simulate the closed-loop behavior of the resulting controllers during five emergency maneuvers for different prediction horizons. Further, we compare the robustness of the controllers in the presence of friction uncertainty as well to assess the accuracy-time trade-off in cases where the friction of the road is either unknown or has an offset error with respect to the prediction model. This robustness is studied for different levels of friction uncertainty, as well as investigated with respect to the proximity to the vehicle handling limits. We show that the hybridization of the MPC problem is an efficient approach for real-time implementation of MPC during emergency evasive maneuvers, paving the way for implementation of high levels of automation.</description>

      <title>Decrypting Nonlinearity: Koopman Interpretation and Analysis of Cryptosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public-key cryptosystems rely on computationally difficult problems for security, traditionally analyzed using number theory methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective on cryptosystems by viewing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem as nonlinear dynamical systems. By applying Koopman theory, we transform these dynamical systems into higher-dimensional spaces and analytically derive equivalent purely linear systems. This formulation allows us to reconstruct the secret integers of the cryptosystems through straightforward manipulations, leveraging the tools available for linear systems analysis. Additionally, we establish an upper bound on the minimum lifting dimension required to achieve perfect accuracy. Our results on the required lifting dimension are in line with the intractability of brute-force attacks. To showcase the potential of our approach, we establish connections between our findings and existing results on algorithmic complexity. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to a data-driven context, where the Koopman representation is learned from data samples of the cryptosystems.</description>

      <title>A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Cloud-Based HVAC Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this work is (i) to develop an encrypted cloud-based HVAC control framework to ensure the privacy of occupancy information, (ii) to reduce the communication and computation costs of encrypted HVAC control,(iii) to reduce the leakage of private information via the triggering time instances. Occupancy of a building is sensitive and private information that can be accurately inferred by cloud-based HVAC controllers. To ensure the privacy of the privacy information, in our framework, the measurements of an HVAC system are encrypted by a fully homomorphic encryption prior to communication with the cloud controller. We first develop an encrypted algorithm that allows the cloud controller to regulate the indoor temperature and CO_2 of a building. We next develop an event-triggered control policy to reduce the communication and computation costs of the encrypted HVAC control. We cast the optimal design of the event-triggered policy as an optimal control problem. Using Bellman's optimality principle, we study the structural properties of the optimal event-triggered policy and show the necessary information for optimal triggering policy. We also show that the optimal design of the event-triggered policy can be transformed into a Markov decision process by introducing new states. As the triggering time instances are not encrypted, there is a risk that the cloud may use them to deduce sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, we introduce two randomized triggering strategies. We finally study the performance of the developed encrypted HVAC control framework using the TRNSYS simulator. Our numerical results show that the proposed framework not only ensures efficient control of the indoor temperature and CO$_2$ but also reduces the computation and communication costs of encrypted HVAC control by at least 60%.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>

      <title>On the analysis of a higher-order Lotka-Volterra model: an application of S-tensors and the polynomial complementarity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the effect of species' density on species' growth is non-additive in real ecological systems. This challenges the conventional Lotka-Volterra model, where the interactions are always pairwise and their effects are additive. To address this challenge, we introduce HOIs (Higher-Order Interactions) which are able to capture, for example, the indirect effect of one species on a second one correlating to a third species. Towards this end, we propose a general higher-order Lotka-Volterra model. We provide an existence result of a positive equilibrium for a non-homogeneous polynomial equation system with the help of S-tensors. Afterward, by utilizing the latter result, as well as the theory of monotone systems and results from the polynomial complementarity problem, we provide comprehensive results regarding the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the corresponding equilibrium. These results can be regarded as natural extensions of many analogous ones for the classical Lotka-Volterra model, especially in the case of full cooperation, competition among two factions, and pure competition. Finally, illustrative numerical examples are provided to highlight our contributions.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Waveform Generated Metasurface: A New Paradigm for Direct Modulation and Beamforming Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) are especially important in a variety of fields like radar detection, wireless communications and integrated sensing and communications. Typically, backscatter devices are used to achieve passive signal reflection modulation to facilitate information transmission or to interfere with radar echoes. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) or Metasurface is a promising technology that combines the advantages of backscatter devices and reflective array antennas. Previous studies demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve reflection modulation by utilizing the superposition of the quantified reflective coefficient (RC) of each unit but suffer from the computing complexity of codebook sequence, the safety of communication, and the flexibility of modulation. To overcome the difficulties, we propose new paradigm of metasurface, i.e. AWG-RIS, that can independently generate arbitrary baseband waveforms and beam patterns based on a magnitude-phase decoupled unit design without altering the beam pattern. We proposed an analysis framework and introduce waveform factor and beamforming factor into the new model which provide the theoretical support for the flow from the control signal to the outgoing electromagnetic wave. Furthermore, we introduce the world's first prototype that demonstrates passive arbitrary waveform generation without altering the beam pattern. The experiments validate the generation of arbitrary waveforms and spectrograms, both for a single input and through the superposition of multiple inputs.</description>

      <title>Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13065v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generally, day-ahead unit commitment (UC) is conducted in a predict-then-optimize process: it starts by predicting the renewable energy source (RES) availability and system reserve requirements; given the predictions, the UC model is then optimized to determine the economic operation plans. In fact, predictions within the process are raw. In other words, if the predictions are further tailored to assist UC in making the economic operation plans against realizations of the RES and reserve requirements, UC economics will benefit significantly. To this end, this paper presents a cost-oriented tailor of RES-and-reserve predictions for UC, deployed as an add-on to the predict-then-optimize process. The RES-and-reserve tailor is trained by solving a bi-level mixed-integer programming model: the upper level trains the tailor based on its induced operating cost; the lower level, given tailored predictions, mimics the system operation process and feeds the induced operating cost back to the upper level; finally, the upper level evaluates the training quality according to the fed-back cost. Through this training, the tailor learns to customize the raw predictions into cost-oriented predictions. Moreover, the tailor can be embedded into the existing predict-then-optimize process as an add-on, improving the UC economics. Lastly, the presented method is compared to traditional, binary-relaxation, neural network-based, stochastic, and robust methods.</description>

      <title>MIST: An Efficient Approach for Software-Defined Multicast in Wireless Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multicasting is a vital information dissemination technique in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). With SDN, a multicast service can incorporate network functions implemented at different nodes, which is referred to as software-defined multicast. Emerging ubiquitous wireless networks for 5G and Beyond (B5G) inherently support multicast. However, the broadcast nature of wireless channels, especially in dense deployments, leads to neighborhood interference as a primary system degradation factor, which introduces a new challenge for software-defined multicast in wireless mesh networks. To tackle this, this paper introduces an innovative approach, based on the idea of minimizing both the total length cost of the multicast tree and the interference at the same time. Accordingly, a novel bicriteria optimization problem is formulated--\emph{Minimum Interference Steiner Tree (MIST)}, which is the edge-weighted variant of the vertex-weighted secluded Steiner tree problem \cite{chechik2013secluded}. To solve the bicriteria problem, instead of resorting to heuristics, this paper employs an innovative approach that is an approximate algorithm for MIST but with guaranteed performance. Specifically, the approach exploits the monotone submodularity property of the interference metric and identifies Pareto optimal solutions for MIST, then converts the problem into the submodular minimization under Steiner tree constraints, and designs a two-stage relaxation algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate and validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Blending Data-Driven Priors in Dynamic Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As intelligent robots like autonomous vehicles become increasingly deployed in the presence of people, the extent to which these systems should leverage model-based game-theoretic planners versus data-driven policies for safe, interaction-aware motion planning remains an open question. Existing dynamic game formulations assume all agents are task-driven and behave optimally. However, in reality, humans tend to deviate from the decisions prescribed by these models, and their behavior is better approximated under a noisy-rational paradigm. In this work, we investigate a principled methodology to blend a data-driven reference policy with an optimization-based game-theoretic policy. We formulate KLGame, an algorithm for solving non-cooperative dynamic game with Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization with respect to a general, stochastic, and possibly multi-modal reference policy. Our method incorporates, for each decision maker, a tunable parameter that permits modulation between task-driven and data-driven behaviors. We propose an efficient algorithm for computing multi-modal approximate feedback Nash equilibrium strategies of KLGame in real time. Through a series of simulated and real-world autonomous driving scenarios, we demonstrate that KLGame policies can more effectively incorporate guidance from the reference policy and account for noisily-rational human behaviors versus non-regularized baselines.

      <title>The optimizing mode classification stabilization of sampled stochastic jump systems via an improved hill-climbing algorithm based on Q-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stabilization problem of stochastic jump systems (SJSs) closed by a generally sampled controller. Because of the controller's switching and state both sampled, it is challenging to study its stabilization. A new stabilizing method deeply depending on the mode classifications is proposed to deal with the above sampling situation, whose quantity is equal to a Stirling number of the second kind. For the sake of finding the best stabilization effect among all the classifications, a convex optimization problem is developed, whose globally solution is proved to be existent and can be computed by an augmented Lagrangian function. More importantly, in order to further reduce the computation complexity but retaining a better performance as much as possible, a novelly improved hill-climbing algorithm is established by applying the Q-learning technique to provide an optimal attenuation coefficient. A numerical example is offered so as to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the methods proposed in this study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a wireless network with multiple single-antenna repeaters that amplify and instantaneously re-transmit the signals they receive to improve the channel rank and system coverage. Due to the positive feedback formed by inter-repeater interference, stability could become a critical issue. We investigate the problem of determining the maximum amplification gain that the repeaters can use without breaking the system stability. Specifically, we obtain a bound by using the Gershgorin disc theorem, which reveals that the maximum amplification gain is restricted by the sum of channel amplitude gains. We show by case studies the usefulness of the so-obtained bound and provide insights on how the repeaters should be deployed.</description>

      <title>Fast-Fading Channel and Power Optimization of the Magnetic Inductive Cellular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cellular network of magnetic Induction (MI) communication holds promise in long-distance underground environments. In the traditional MI communication, there is no fast-fading channel since the MI channel is treated as a quasi-static channel. However, for the vehicle (mobile) MI (VMI) communication, the unpredictable antenna vibration brings the remarkable fast-fading. As such fast-fading cannot be modeled by the central limit theorem, it differs radically from other wireless fast-fading channels. Unfortunately, few studies focus on this phenomenon. In this paper, using a novel space modeling based on the electromagnetic field theorem, we propose a 3-dimension model of the VMI antenna vibration. By proposing ``conjugate pseudo-piecewise functions'' and boundary $p(x)$ distribution, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF), probability density function (PDF) and the expectation of the VMI fast-fading channel. We also theoretically analyze the effects of the VMI fast-fading on the network throughput, including the VMI outage probability which can be ignored in the traditional MI channel study. We draw several intriguing conclusions different from those in wireless fast-fading studies. For instance, the fast-fading brings more uniformly distributed channel coefficients. Finally, we propose the power control algorithm using the non-cooperative game and multiagent Q-learning methods to optimize the throughput of the cellular VMI network. Simulations validate the derivation and the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection for agents on power grid topology optimization: A Comprehensive analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topology optimization of transmission networks using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has increasingly come into focus. Various researchers have proposed different DRL agents, which are often benchmarked on the Grid2Op environment from the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) challenges. The environments have many advantages with their realistic chronics and underlying power flow backends. However, the interpretation of agent survival or failure is not always clear, as there are a variety of potential causes. In this work, we focus on the failures of the power grid to identify patterns and detect them a priori. We collect the failed chronics of three different agents on the WCCI 2022 L2RPN environment, totaling about 40k data points. By clustering, we are able to detect five distinct clusters, identifying different failure types. Further, we propose a multi-class prediction approach to detect failures beforehand and evaluate five different models. Here, the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) shows the best performance, with an accuracy of 86%. It also correctly identifies in 91% of the time failure and survival observations. Finally, we provide a detailed feature importance analysis that identifies critical features and regions in the grid.</description>

      <title>Lithium-Ion Battery System Health Monitoring and Fault Analysis from Field Data Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Health monitoring, fault analysis, and detection are critical for the safe and sustainable operation of battery systems. We apply Gaussian process resistance models on lithium iron phosphate battery field data to effectively separate the time-dependent and operating point-dependent resistance. The data set contains 29 battery systems returned to the manufacturer for warranty, each with eight cells in series, totaling 232 cells and 131 million data rows. We develop probabilistic fault detection rules using recursive spatiotemporal Gaussian processes. These processes allow the quick processing of over a million data points, enabling advanced online monitoring and furthering the understanding of battery pack failure in the field. The analysis underlines that often, only a single cell shows abnormal behavior or a knee point, consistent with weakest-link failure for cells connected in series, amplified by local resistive heating. The results further the understanding of how batteries degrade and fail in the field and demonstrate the potential of efficient online monitoring based on data. We open-source the code and publish the large data set upon completion of the review of this article.</description>
