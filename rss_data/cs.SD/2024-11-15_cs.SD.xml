      <title>Language Models for Music Medicine Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music therapy has been shown in recent years to provide multiple health benefits related to emotional wellness. In turn, maintaining a healthy emotional state has proven to be effective for patients undergoing treatment, such as Parkinson's patients or patients suffering from stress and anxiety. We propose fine-tuning MusicGen, a music-generating transformer model, to create short musical clips that assist patients in transitioning from negative to desired emotional states. Using low-rank decomposition fine-tuning on the MTG-Jamendo Dataset with emotion tags, we generate 30-second clips that adhere to the iso principle, guiding patients through intermediate states in the valence-arousal circumplex. The generated music is evaluated using a music emotion recognition model to ensure alignment with intended emotions. By concatenating these clips, we produce a 15-minute "music medicine" resembling a music therapy session. Our approach is the first model to leverage Language Models to generate music medicine. Ultimately, the output is intended to be used as a temporary relief between music therapy sessions with a board-certified therapist.</description>

      <title>Robust AI-Synthesized Speech Detection Using Feature Decomposition Learning and Synthesizer Feature Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-synthesized speech, also known as deepfake speech, has recently raised significant concerns due to the rapid advancement of speech synthesis and speech conversion techniques. Previous works often rely on distinguishing synthesizer artifacts to identify deepfake speech. However, excessive reliance on these specific synthesizer artifacts may result in unsatisfactory performance when addressing speech signals created by unseen synthesizers. In this paper, we propose a robust deepfake speech detection method that employs feature decomposition to learn synthesizer-independent content features as complementary for detection. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream feature decomposition learning strategy that decomposes the learned speech representation using a synthesizer stream and a content stream. The synthesizer stream specializes in learning synthesizer features through supervised training with synthesizer labels. Meanwhile, the content stream focuses on learning synthesizer-independent content features, enabled by a pseudo-labeling-based supervised learning method. This method randomly transforms speech to generate speed and compression labels for training. Additionally, we employ an adversarial learning technique to reduce the synthesizer-related components in the content stream. The final classification is determined by concatenating the synthesizer and content features. To enhance the model's robustness to different synthesizer characteristics, we further propose a synthesizer feature augmentation strategy that randomly blends the characteristic styles within real and fake audio features and randomly shuffles the synthesizer features with the content features. This strategy effectively enhances the feature diversity and simulates more feature combinations.</description>

      <title>EEG-Based Speech Decoding: A Novel Approach Using Multi-Kernel Ensemble Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an ensemble learning framework for electroencephalogram-based overt speech classification, leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models with varying convolutional kernel sizes. The ensemble comprises three models with kernel sizes of 51, 101, and 201, effectively capturing multi-scale temporal features inherent in signals. This approach improves the robustness and accuracy of speech decoding by accommodating the rich temporal complexity of neural signals. The ensemble models work in conjunction with conditional autoencoders that refine the reconstructed signals and maximize the useful information for downstream classification tasks. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble-based approach significantly outperforms individual models and existing state-of-the-art techniques. These findings demonstrate the potential of ensemble methods in advancing brain signal decoding, offering new possibilities for non-verbal communication applications, particularly in brain-computer interface systems aimed at aiding individuals with speech impairments.</description>

      <title>Re-Parameterization of Lightweight Transformer for On-Device Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing implementation of machine learning models on edge or Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, deploying advanced models on resource-constrained IoT devices remains challenging. Transformer models, a currently dominant neural architecture, have achieved great success in broad domains but their complexity hinders its deployment on IoT devices with limited computation capability and storage size. Although many model compression approaches have been explored, they often suffer from notorious performance degradation. To address this issue, we introduce a new method, namely Transformer Re-parameterization, to boost the performance of lightweight Transformer models. It consists of two processes: the High-Rank Factorization (HRF) process in the training stage and the deHigh-Rank Factorization (deHRF) process in the inference stage. In the former process, we insert an additional linear layer before the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the lightweight Transformer. It is supposed that the inserted HRF layers can enhance the model learning capability. In the later process, the auxiliary HRF layer will be merged together with the following FFN layer into one linear layer and thus recover the original structure of the lightweight model. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluate it on three widely used Transformer variants, i.e., ConvTransformer, Conformer, and SpeechFormer networks, in the application of speech emotion recognition on the IEMOCAP, M3ED and DAIC-WOZ datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method consistently improves the performance of lightweight Transformers, even making them comparable to large models. The proposed re-parameterization approach enables advanced Transformer models to be deployed on resource-constrained IoT devices.</description>

      <title>ParaLBench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Computational Paralinguistics over Acoustic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational paralinguistics (ComParal) aims to develop algorithms and models to automatically detect, analyze, and interpret non-verbal information from speech communication, e. g., emotion, health state, age, and gender. Despite its rapid progress, it heavily depends on sophisticatedly designed models given specific paralinguistic tasks. Thus, the heterogeneity and diversity of ComParal models largely prevent the realistic implementation of ComParal models. Recently, with the advent of acoustic foundation models because of self-supervised learning, developing more generic models that can efficiently perceive a plethora of paralinguistic information has become an active topic in speech processing. However, it lacks a unified evaluation framework for a fair and consistent performance comparison. To bridge this gap, we conduct a large-scale benchmark, namely ParaLBench, which concentrates on standardizing the evaluation process of diverse paralinguistic tasks, including critical aspects of affective computing such as emotion recognition and emotion dimensions prediction, over different acoustic foundation models. This benchmark contains ten datasets with thirteen distinct paralinguistic tasks, covering short-, medium- and long-term characteristics. Each task is carried out on 14 acoustic foundation models under a unified evaluation framework, which allows for an unbiased methodological comparison and offers a grounded reference for the ComParal community. Based on the insights gained from ParaLBench, we also point out potential research directions, i.e., the cross-corpus generalizability, to propel ComParal research in the future. The code associated with this study will be available to foster the transparency and replicability of this work for succeeding researchers.</description>

      <title>Local deployment of large-scale music AI models on commodity hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the MIDInfinite, a web application capable of generating symbolic music using a large-scale generative AI model locally on commodity hardware. Creating this demo involved porting the Anticipatory Music Transformer, a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on the Lakh MIDI dataset, to the Machine Learning Compilation (MLC) framework. Once the model is ported, MLC facilitates inference on a variety of runtimes including C++, mobile, and the browser. We envision that MLC has the potential to bridge the gap between the landscape of increasingly capable music AI models and technology more familiar to music software developers. As a proof of concept, we build a web application that allows users to generate endless streams of multi-instrumental MIDI in the browser, either from scratch or conditioned on a prompt. On commodity hardware (an M3 Macbook Pro), our demo can generate 51 notes per second, which is faster than real-time playback for 72.9% of generations, and increases to 86.3% with 2 seconds of upfront buffering.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Lie Detection Accuracy: A Comparative Study of Classic ML, CNN, and GCN Models using Audio-Visual Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inaccuracies in polygraph tests often lead to wrongful convictions, false information, and bias, all of which have significant consequences for both legal and political systems. Recently, analyzing facial micro-expressions has emerged as a method for detecting deception; however, current models have not reached high accuracy and generalizability. The purpose of this study is to aid in remedying these problems. The unique multimodal transformer architecture used in this study improves upon previous approaches by using auditory inputs, visual facial micro-expressions, and manually transcribed gesture annotations, moving closer to a reliable non-invasive lie detection model. Visual and auditory features were extracted using the Vision Transformer and OpenSmile models respectively, which were then concatenated with the transcriptions of participants micro-expressions and gestures. Various models were trained for the classification of lies and truths using these processed and concatenated features. The CNN Conv1D multimodal model achieved an average accuracy of 95.4%. However, further research is still required to create higher-quality datasets and even more generalized models for more diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Improvement and Implementation of a Speech Emotion Recognition Model Based on Dual-Layer LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper builds upon an existing speech emotion recognition model by adding an additional LSTM layer to improve the accuracy and processing efficiency of emotion recognition from audio data. By capturing the long-term dependencies within audio sequences through a dual-layer LSTM network, the model can recognize and classify complex emotional patterns more accurately. Experiments conducted on the RAVDESS dataset validated this approach, showing that the modified dual layer LSTM model improves accuracy by 2% compared to the single-layer LSTM while significantly reducing recognition latency, thereby enhancing real-time performance. These results indicate that the dual-layer LSTM architecture is highly suitable for handling emotional features with long-term dependencies, providing a viable optimization for speech emotion recognition systems. This research provides a reference for practical applications in fields like intelligent customer service, sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Neural Decoding of Perceived, Spoken and Imagined Speech from EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain signals accompany various information relevant to human actions and mental imagery, making them crucial to interpreting and understanding human intentions. Brain-computer interface technology leverages this brain activity to generate external commands for controlling the environment, offering critical advantages to individuals with paralysis or locked-in syndrome. Within the brain-computer interface domain, brain-to-speech research has gained attention, focusing on the direct synthesis of audible speech from brain signals. Most current studies decode speech from brain activity using invasive techniques and emphasize spoken speech data. However, humans express various speech states, and distinguishing these states through non-invasive approaches remains a significant yet challenging task. This research investigated the effectiveness of deep learning models for non-invasive-based neural signal decoding, with an emphasis on distinguishing between different speech paradigms, including perceived, overt, whispered, and imagined speech, across multiple frequency bands. The model utilizing the spatial conventional neural network module demonstrated superior performance compared to other models, especially in the gamma band. Additionally, imagined speech in the theta frequency band, where deep learning also showed strong effects, exhibited statistically significant differences compared to the other speech paradigms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present SeMaScore, generated using a segment-wise mapping and scoring algorithm that serves as an evaluation metric for automatic speech recognition tasks. SeMaScore leverages both the error rate and a more robust similarity score. We show that our algorithm's score generation improves upon the state-of-the-art BERTScore. Our experimental results show that SeMaScore corresponds well with expert human assessments, signal-to-noise ratio levels, and other natural language metrics. We outperform BERTScore by 41x in metric computation speed. Overall, we demonstrate that SeMaScore serves as a more dependable evaluation metric, particularly in real-world situations involving atypical speech patterns.</description>
