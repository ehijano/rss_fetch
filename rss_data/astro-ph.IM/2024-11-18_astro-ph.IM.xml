      <title>The SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM): Data Analysis Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP) for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) project, referred to as the LVM-DAP. We outline our methods for recovering both stellar and emission line components from the optical integral field spectroscopy, highlighting the developments and changes implemented to address specific challenges of the data set. The observations from the LVM project are unique because they cover a wide range of physical resolutions, from approximately 0.05 pc to 100 pc, depending on the distance to the targets. This, along with the varying number of stars sampled in each aperture (ranging from zero, just one of a few, to thousands), presents challenges in using previous spectral synthesis methods and interpreting the spectral fits. We provide a detailed explanation of how we model the stellar content and separate it from the ionized gas emission lines. To assess the accuracy of our results, we compare them with both idealized and more realistic simulations, highlighting the limitations of our methods. We find that the DAP robustly correct for stellar continuum features and recover emission line parameters (e.g. flux, equivalent width, systemtic velocity and velocity dispersion) with a precision and accuracy that fulfill the requirements of the primary goal of the analysis. In addition, the recovered stellar parameters are reliable for single stars, the recovery of integrated populations is less precise. We conclude with a description of the data products we provide, instructions for downloading and using our software, and a showcase illustrating the quality of the data and the analysis on a deep exposure taken on the Huygens region at the center of the Orion Nebula.</description>

      <title>The Last Arecibo Message</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arecibo Message was a brief binary-encoded communication transmitted into space from the Arecibo Observatory on November 16, 1974, intended to demonstrate human technological prowess. In late 2018, to commemorate the 45th anniversary of this message, the Arecibo Observatory initiated the New Arecibo Message competition. Following a series of challenges, our Boriken Voyagers team was recognized as the winner of the competition in August 2020. Although the primary objective of the competition was to conceptualize rather than transmit a message, the collapse of the Arecibo Telescope in December 2020 precluded any subsequent transmission efforts. Therefore, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Arecibo Message, this paper presents the Last Arecibo Message, as originally developed for the Arecibo Telescope. If the original message says "we are a form of life reaching out to connect", our message says "we are ready to explore the universe together." The prospect of transmitting this or a similar message remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Technological Novelties of Ground-Based Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Astrophysics with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last three decades, the ground-based technique of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes has established itself as a powerful scientific discipline. About 250 very high gamma-ray sources of both galactic and extragalactic origin have been discovered, largely thanks to this technique. The study of these sources provides clues to many fundamental questions in astrophysics, astroparticle physics, cosmic ray physics and cosmology. The current generation of telescopes in operation offers solid performance. Further improvements in this technique led to the next generation large-scale instrument known as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). In its final configuration, the sensitivity of CTA will be several times higher than that of the current best instruments VERITAS, H.E.S.S. and MAGIC. This article is devoted to presenting the technological developments that have shaped this technique and led to its current success.</description>

      <title>BICEP/Keck XIX: Extremely Thin Composite Polymer Vacuum Windows for BICEP and Other High Throughput Millimeter Wave Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave refracting telescopes targeting the degree-scale structure of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have recently grown to diffraction-limited apertures of over 0.5 meters. These instruments are entirely housed in vacuum cryostats to support their sub-kelvin bolometric detectors and to minimize radiative loading from thermal emission due to absorption loss in their transmissive optical elements. The large vacuum window is the only optical element in the system at ambient temperature, and therefore minimizing loss in the window is crucial for maximizing detector sensitivity. This motivates the use of low-loss polymer materials and a window as thin as practicable. However, the window must simultaneously meet the requirement to keep sufficient vacuum, and therefore must limit gas permeation and remain mechanically robust against catastrophic failure under pressure. We report on the development of extremely thin composite polyethylene window technology that meets these goals. Two windows have been deployed for two full observing seasons on the BICEP3 and BA150 CMB telescopes at the South Pole. On BICEP3, the window has demonstrated a 6% improvement in detector sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Gasoline: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxy formation with Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first set of high-resolution, hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in a Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) framework. These simulations were performed with a new version of the GASOLINE2 code, known as FUZZY-GASOLINE, which can simulate quantum FDM effects alongside a comprehensive baryonic model that includes metal cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and black hole physics, previously used in the NIHAO simulation suite. Using thirty zoom-in simulations of galaxies with halo masses in the range $10^9 \lesssim M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{11}$, we explore how the interplay between FDM quantum potential and baryonic processes influences dark matter distributions and observable galaxy properties. Our findings indicate that both baryons and low-mass FDM contribute to core formation within dark matter profiles, though through distinct mechanisms: FDM-induced cores emerge in all haloes, particularly within low-mass systems at high redshift, while baryon-driven cores form within a specific mass range and at low redshift. Despite these significant differences in dark matter structure, key stellar observables such as star formation histories and velocity dispersion profiles remain remarkably similar to predictions from the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, making it challenging to distinguish between CDM and FDM solely through stellar observations.</description>

      <title>Assessing the detection of the Yarkovsky effect using Gaia DR3 and FPR catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this study was to utilize the newest Gaia FPR catalogue containing ultra-precise asteroid astrometry spanning over 66 months to detect the Yarkovsky effect, a non-gravitational acceleration that affects the orbits of small asteroids. Moreover, this study examines close approaches of near-Earth asteroids by comparing orbits calculated using the Gaia data. We used the conventional least-squares orbit computation method available in the OrbFit software. We used the latest Gaia Focused Product Release, complemented by data from the Minor Planet Center and radar astrometry from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We fitted orbital parameters for 446 Near-Earth Asteroids, including the additional non-gravitational transverse acceleration to model the Yarkovsky effect. Furthermore, we compared the results obtained using different datasets: Gaia Focused Product Release and the previous Gaia Data Release 3. We detected a robust Yarkovsky effect in 43 NEAs. As expected, we found an improvement in the orbital elements uncertainty and in the signal-to-noise ratio of the Yarkovsky effect detections when using the current Gaia FPR with double the observing arc compared to the DR3 catalog. We also found nine additional reliable detections of the Yarkovsky effect when using the new Gaia FPR catalog. Including the Yarkovsky effect in the force model can be important to reliably estimate close approach distances of near-Earth asteroids. Several of the detected Yarkovsky drifts already have a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10, which is high enough for their Yarkovsky effect to be included in their reliable long-term orbital evolution, close approach, and Earth impact analysis. The final Gaia catalog may provide a much higher number of high signal-to-noise ratio detections of the Yarkovsky effect.</description>

      <title>The Exoplanet Edge: Planets Don't Induce Observable TTVs Faster than Half their Orbital Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transit timing variations (TTVs) are observed for exoplanets at a range of amplitudes and periods, yielding an ostensibly degenerate forest of possible explanations. We offer some clarity in this forest, showing that systems with a distant perturbing planet preferentially show TTVs with a dominant period equal to either the perturbing planet's period or half the perturbing planet's period. We demonstrate that planet induced TTVs are not expected with TTV periods below this exoplanet edge (lower period limit) and that systems with TTVs that fall below this limit likely contain additional mass in the system. We present an explanation for both of these periods, showing that both aliasing of the conjunction induced synodic period and the near $1:2$ resonance super-period and tidal effects induce TTVs at periods equal to either the perturber's orbit or half-orbit. We provide three examples of known systems for which the recovered TTV period induced by a distant perturbing planet is equal to the perturber's orbital period or half its orbital period. We then investigate $\textit{Kepler}$ two-planet systems with TTVs and identify 13 two-planet systems with TTVs below this TTV period lower limit -- thus potentially uncovering the gravitational influence of new planets and/or moons. We conclude by discussing how the exoplanet edge effects can be used to predict the presence of distance companion planets, in situations where TTVs are detected and where nearby companions can be ruled out by additional observations, such as radial velocity data.</description>

      <title>The democratic detrender: Ensemble-Based Removal of the Nuisance Signal in Stellar Time-Series Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, precise, and computationally efficient removal of unwanted activity that exists as a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic systematic trends in time-series photometric data is a critical step in exoplanet transit analysis. Throughout the years, many different modeling methods have been used for this process, often called "detrending." However, there is no community-wide consensus regarding the favored approach. In order to mitigate model dependency, we present an ensemble-based approach to detrending via community-of-models and the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$: a modular and scalable open-source coding package that implements ensemble detrending. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ allows users to select from a number of packaged detrending methods (including cosine filtering, Gaussian processes, and polynomial fits) or provide their own set of detrended light curves via methods of their choosing. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ then combines the resulting individually detrended light curves into a single method marginalized (via median selection) light curve. Additionally, the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ inflates the uncertainties of each time-series data point using information from the median absolute deviation between the individually detrended light curve, propagating information into the final detrended light curve about the added uncertainty due to the correctness of the underlying models.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715 by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.
  Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.
  Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.
  Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling beam chromaticity for high-resolution CMB analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of beam chromaticity, i.e., the frequency dependence of the beam window function, on cosmological and astrophysical parameter constraints from CMB power spectrum observations. We show that for future high-resolution CMB measurements it is necessary to include a color-corrected beam for each sky component with a distinct spectral energy distribution. We introduce a formalism able to easily implement the beam chromaticity in CMB power spectrum likelihood analyses and run a case study using a Simons Observatory (SO) Large Aperture Telescope-like experimental setup and within the public SO software stack. To quantify the impact, we assume that beam chromaticity is present in simulated spectra but omitted in the likelihood analysis. We find that, for passbands of fractional width $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.2$, neglecting this effect leads to significant biases, with astrophysical foreground parameters shifting by more than $2\sigma$ and cosmological parameters by significant fractions of the error.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Multiwavelength Blazar Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with relativistic jets pointing toward the observer. They are notable for their flux variability at all observed wavelengths and timescales. Together with simultaneous measurements at lower energies, the very-high-energy (VHE) emission observed during blazar flares may be used to probe the population of accelerated particles. However, optimally triggering observations of blazar high states can be challenging. Notable examples include identifying a flaring episode in real time and predicting VHE flaring activity based on lower energy observables. For this purpose, we have developed a novel deep learning analysis framework, based on data-driven anomaly detection techniques. It is capable of detecting various types of anomalies in real-world, multiwavelength light curves, ranging from clear high states to subtle correlations across bands. Based on unsupervised anomaly detection and clustering methods, we differentiate source variability from noisy background activity, without the need for a labeled training dataset of flaring states. The framework incorporates measurement uncertainties and is robust given data quality challenges, such as varying cadences and observational gaps. We evaluate our approach using both historical data and simulations of blazar light curves in two energy bands, corresponding to sources observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). In a statistical analysis, we show that our framework can reliably detect known historical flares.</description>

      <title>Design of Dedicated Tilt-to-Length Calibration Maneuvers for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilts of certain elements within a laser interferometer can undesirably couple into measurements as a form of noise, known as tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. This TTL coupling is anticipated to be one of the primary noise sources in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, after Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is applied. Despite the careful interferometer design and calibration on the ground, TTL is likely to require in-flight mitigation through post-processing subtraction to achieve the necessary sensitivity. Past research has demonstrated TTL subtraction in simulations through the estimation of 24 linear coupling coefficients using a noise minimization approach. This paper investigates an approach based on performing rotation maneuvers for estimating coupling coefficients with low uncertainties. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and optimal configurations of such maneuvers to identify the most efficient solutions. We assess the efficacy of TTL calibration maneuvers by modulating either the spacecraft attitude or the Moving Optical Sub-Assembly (MOSA) yaw angle. We found that sinusoidal signals with amplitudes of around 30 nrad and frequencies near 43 mHz are practical and nearly optimal choices for such modulations. Employing different frequencies generates uncorrelated signals, allowing for multiple maneuvers to be executed simultaneously. Our simulations enable us to estimate the TTL coefficients with precision below 15 um/rad (1-sigma, in free space) after a total maneuver time of 20 minutes. The results are compared to the estimation uncertainties that can be achieved without using maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional optimisation of the scanning strategy for the LiteBIRD space mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large angular scale surveys in the absence of atmosphere are essential for measuring the primordial $B$-mode power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Since this proposed measurement is about three to four orders of magnitude fainter than the temperature anisotropies of the CMB, in-flight calibration of the instruments and active suppression of systematic effects are crucial. We investigate the effect of changing the parameters of the scanning strategy on the in-flight calibration effectiveness, the suppression of the systematic effects themselves, and the ability to distinguish systematic effects by null-tests. Next-generation missions such as LiteBIRD, modulated by a Half-Wave Plate (HWP), will be able to observe polarisation using a single detector, eliminating the need to combine several detectors to measure polarisation, as done in many previous experiments and hence avoiding the consequent systematic effects. While the HWP is expected to suppress many systematic effects, some of them will remain. We use an analytical approach to comprehensively address the mitigation of these systematic effects and identify the characteristics of scanning strategies that are the most effective for implementing a variety of calibration strategies in the multi-dimensional space of common spacecraft scan parameters. We also present Falcons, a fast spacecraft scanning simulator that we developed to investigate this scanning parameter space.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy using a visible photonic lantern at the Subaru telescope: Laboratory characterization and first on-sky demonstration on Ikiiki ({\alpha} Leo) and `Aua ({\alpha} Ori)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic lanterns are waveguide devices enabling high throughput single mode spectroscopy and high angular resolution. We aim to present the first on-sky demonstration of a photonic lantern (PL) operating in visible light, to measure its throughput and assess its potential for high-resolution spectroscopy of compact objects. We used the SCExAO instrument (a double stage extreme AO system installed at the Subaru telescope) and FIRST mid-resolution spectrograph (R 3000) to test the visible capabilities of the PL on internal source and on-sky observations. The best averaged coupling efficiency over the PL field of view was measured at 51% +/- 10% with a peak at 80%. We also investigate the relationship between coupling efficiency and the Strehl ratio for a PL, comparing them with those of a single-mode fiber (SMF). Findings show that in the AO regime, a PL offers better coupling efficiency performance than a SMF, especially in the presence of low spatial frequency aberrations. We observed Ikiiki (alpha Leo - mR = 1.37) and `Aua (alpha Ori - mR = -1.17) at a frame rate of 200 Hz. Under median seeing conditions (about 1 arcsec measured in H band) and large tip/tilt residuals (over 20 mas), we estimated an average light coupling efficiency of 14.5% +/- 7.4%, with a maximum of 42.8% at 680 nm. We were able to reconstruct both star's spectra, containing various absorption lines. The successful demonstration of this device opens new possibilities in terms of high throughput single-mode fiber-fed spectroscopy in the Visible. The demonstrated on-sky coupling efficiency performance would not have been achievable with a single SMF injection setup under similar conditions, partly because the residual tip/tilt alone exceeded the field of view of a visible SMF (18 mas at 700 nm). Thus emphasizing the enhanced resilience of PL technology to such atmospheric disturbances. The additional</description>

Abstract: We present coniferest, an open source generic purpose active anomaly detection framework written in Python. The package design and implemented algorithms are described. Currently, static outlier detection analysis is supported via the Isolation forest algorithm. Moreover, Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) and Pineforest algorithms are available to tackle active anomaly detection problems. The algorithms and package performance are evaluated on a series of synthetic datasets. We also describe a few success cases which resulted from applying the package to real astronomical data in active anomaly detection tasks within the SNAD project.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as Standard Candles for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, fast radio bursts (FRBs) have become a thriving field in astronomy and cosmology. Due to their extragalactic and cosmological origin, they are useful to study the cosmic expansion and the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the literature, the dispersion measure (DM) of FRB has been considered extensively. It could be used as an indirect proxy of the luminosity distance $d_L$ of FRB. The observed DM contains the contributions from the Milky Way (MW), the MW halo, IGM, and the host galaxy. Unfortunately, IGM and the host galaxy of FRB are poorly known to date, and hence the large uncertainties of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ in DM plague the FRB cosmology. Could we avoid DM in studying cosmology? Could we instead consider the luminosity distance $d_L$ directly in the FRB cosmology? We are interested to find a way out for this problem in the present work. From the lessons of calibrating type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as standard candles, we consider a universal subclassification scheme for FRBs, and there are some empirical relations for them. In the present work, we propose to calibrate type Ib FRBs as standard candles by using a tight empirical relation without DM. The calibrated type Ib FRBs at high redshifts can be used like SNIa to constrain the cosmological models. We also test the key factors affecting the calibration and the cosmological constraints. Notice that the results are speculative, since they are based on simulations for the future (instead of now). We stress that the point in the present work is just to propose a viable method and a workable pipeline using type Ib FRBs as standard candles for cosmology in the future.</description>

Abstract: We describe a simple and efficient Python code to perform Bayesian forecasting for gravitational waves (GW) produced by Extreme-Mass-Ratio-Inspiral systems (EMRIs). The code runs on GPUs for an efficient parallelised computation of thousands of waveforms and sampling of the posterior through a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. EMRI_MC generates EMRI waveforms based on the so--called kludge scheme, and propagates it to the observer accounting for cosmological effects in the observed waveform due to modified gravity/dark energy. The code provides a helpful resource for forecasts for interferometry missions in the milli-Hz scale, e.g the satellite-mission LISA.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) searches for analytical expressions representing the relationship between a set of explanatory and response variables. Current SR methods assume a single dataset extracted from a single experiment. Nevertheless, frequently, the researcher is confronted with multiple sets of results obtained from experiments conducted with different setups. Traditional SR methods may fail to find the underlying expression since the parameters of each experiment can be different. In this work we present Multi-View Symbolic Regression (MvSR), which takes into account multiple datasets simultaneously, mimicking experimental environments, and outputs a general parametric solution. This approach fits the evaluated expression to each independent dataset and returns a parametric family of functions f(x; theta) simultaneously capable of accurately fitting all datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MvSR using data generated from known expressions, as well as real-world data from astronomy, chemistry and economy, for which an a priori analytical expression is not available. Results show that MvSR obtains the correct expression more frequently and is robust to hyperparameters change. In real-world data, it is able to grasp the group behavior, recovering known expressions from the literature as well as promising alternatives, thus enabling the use of SR to a large range of experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurements of the LMC Bar's Geometry With Gaia DR3 and a Novel Solution to Crowding Induced Incompleteness in Star Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new measurements of the two-dimensional (2-D) geometry of the LMC's stellar bar with precise astrometric observations of red clump stars in Gaia DR3. We develop a novel solution to tackle crowding induced incompleteness in Gaia datasets with the Gaia BP-RP color excess. Utilizing the color excess information, we derive a 2-D completeness map of the LMC's disk. We find that incompleteness biases the bar measurements and induces large uncertainties. With the completeness-corrected 2-D red clump map, we precisely measure the LMC bar's properties for the first time using Fourier decomposition. The bar radius is $R_{bar} = 2.13^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ kpc, and its position angle is $121.26^{\circ} \pm 0.21^{\circ}$. The bar's strength as quantified by the Fourier bi-symmetric amplitude is $S_{bar} = 0.27$, indicating that the LMC has a significant bar perturbation. We find the bar has an axis ratio of $0.54 \pm 0.03$, and is offset with respect to the center of the outer disk isophote at R $\approx$ 5 kpc by $0.76 \pm 0.01$ kpc. These LMC bar properties agree with a hydrodynamic model where the SMC has undergone a recent direct collision with the LMC. We compare the LMC's bar properties with other barred galaxies in the local universe, and discover that the LMC is similar to other barred galaxies in terms of bar-galaxy scaling relations. We discuss how our completeness correction framework can be applied to other systems in the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first sensitivities to GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter using neutrino detectors, showing that these surpass current solar limits and direct detection results.</description>

Abstract: The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through better particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.</description>
