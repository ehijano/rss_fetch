      <title>Implementability of Global Distributed Protocols modulo Network Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global protocols specify distributed, message-passing protocols from a birds-eye view, and are used as a specification for synthesizing local implementations. Implementability asks whether a given global protocol admits a distributed implementation. We present the first comprehensive investigation of global protocol implementability modulo network architectures. We propose a set of network-parametric Coherence Conditions, and exhibit sufficient assumptions under which it precisely characterizes implementability. We further reduce these assumptions to a minimal set of operational axioms describing insert and remove behavior of individual message buffers. Our reduction immediately establishes that five commonly studied asynchronous network architectures, namely peer-to-peer FIFO, mailbox, senderbox, monobox and bag, are instances of our network-parametric result. We use our characterization to derive optimal complexity results for implementability modulo networks, relationships between classes of implementable global protocols, and symbolic algorithms for deciding implementability modulo networks. We implement the latter in the first network-parametric tool Sprout(A), and show that it achieves network generality without sacrificing performance and modularity.</description>

      <title>DRAMPyML: A Formal Description of DRAM Protocols with Timed Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JEDEC committee defines various domain-specific DRAM standards. These standards feature increasingly complex and evolving protocol specifications, which are detailed in timing diagrams and command tables. Understanding these protocols is becoming progressively challenging as new features and complex device hierarchies are difficult to comprehend without an expressive model. While each JEDEC standard features a simplified state machine, this state machine fails to reflect the parallel operation of memory banks.
  In this paper, we present an evolved modeling approach based on timed Petri nets and Python. This model provides a more accurate representation of DRAM protocols, making them easier to understand and directly executable, which enables the evaluation of interesting metrics and the verification of controller RTL models, DRAM logic and memory simulators.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Polynomial NP-Complete Algorithms Based on the NP Verifier Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While prior work established a verifier-based polynomial time framework for NP, explicit deterministic machines for concrete NP-complete problems have remained elusive.
  In this paper, we construct fully specified deterministic Turing Machines (DTMs) for SAT and Subset-Sum within a polynomial-time NP verifier simulation framework.
  We show that both machines operate in polynomial time and, for satisfiable instances, deterministically generate valid witnesses, thereby extending the framework to deterministic FNP computation without increasing the degree of polynomial complexity. Furthermore, we provide a complete implementation of the framework, including the dynamic computation graph, feasible-graph construction, verification walks, and Turing-machine simulation via edge extensions. The implementation behaves in accordance with the predicted polynomial-time bounds.
  To ensure transparency and reproducibility, the complete Python implementation and source code are made available in a public online repository.</description>

      <title>Multi-Head Finite-State Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce multi-head finite-state dimension, a generalization of finite-state dimension in which a group of finite-state agents (the heads) with oblivious, one-way movement rules, each reporting only one symbol at a time, enable their leader to bet on subsequent symbols in an infinite data stream. In aggregate, such a scheme constitutes an $h$-head finite state gambler whose maximum achievable growth rate of capital in this task, quantified using betting strategies called gales, determines the multi-head finite-state dimension of the sequence. The 1-head case is equivalent to finite-state dimension as defined by Dai, Lathrop, Lutz and Mayordomo (2004). In our main theorem, we prove a strict hierarchy as the number of heads increases, giving an explicit sequence family that separates, for each positive integer $h$, the earning power of $h$-head finite-state gamblers from that of $(h+1)$-head finite-state gamblers. We prove that multi-head finite-state dimension is stable under finite unions but that the corresponding quantity for any fixed number $h&gt;1$ of heads--the $h$-head finite-state predimension--lacks this stability property.</description>

      <title>LOGOS-CA: A Cellular Automaton Using Natural Language as State and Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained solely on massive text data, have achieved high performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a benchmark proposed to measure commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities about the real world. This suggests that the language produced by humanity describes a significant portion of the world with considerable nuance. In this study, we attempt to harness the high expressive power of language within cellular automata. Specifically, we express cell states and rules in natural language and delegate their updates to an LLM. Through this approach, cellular automata can transcend the constraints of merely numerical states and fixed rules, providing us with a richer platform for simulation. Here, we propose LOGOS-CA (Language Oriented Grid Of Statements - Cellular Automaton) as a natural framework to achieve this and examine its capabilities. We confirmed that LOGOS-CA successfully performs simple forest fire simulations and also serves as an intriguing subject for investigation from an Artificial Life (ALife) perspective. In this paper, we report the results of these experiments and discuss directions for future research using LOGOS-CA.</description>
