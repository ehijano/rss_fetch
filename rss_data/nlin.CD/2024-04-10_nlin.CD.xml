      <title>Proposed modified computational model for the amoeba-inspired combinatorial optimization machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single-celled amoeba can solve the traveling salesman problem through its shape-changing dynamics. In this paper, we examine roles of several elements in a previously proposed computational model of the solution-search process of amoeba and three modifications towards enhancing the solution-search preformance. We find that appropriate modifications can indeed significantly improve the quality of solutions. It is also found that a condition associated with the volume conservation can also be modified in contrast to the naive belief that it is indispensable for the solution-search ability of amoeba. A proposed modified model shows much better performance.</description>

      <title>Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality refers to the property that an object and its mirror image cannot overlap each other by spatial rotation and translation, and can be found in various research fields. We here propose chiral chaos and construct a chiral chaotic device via coupled whispering gallery mode resonators, where routes to chaos exhibit pronounced chirality for two opposite pumping directions. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is that time-reversal symmetry of the traveling-wave light fields is broken by the Rayleigh scatterers inserted in resonators. Combining with the Lyapunov exponents, we propose metrics to measure the symmetry and chirality between different chaotic dynamics. We find that such a chiral chaotic device can be applied to achieve sensing with high sensitivity, wide detectable range, and strong robustness to the phase and orientation randomness of weak signals. Our work presents a promising candidate for on-chip sensing and may have applications in quantum networks and chaotic communications.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Transmission Through a Classical Analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been predicted that new physics and technology are enabled for quantum systems that suffer from partial decoherence, in the intermediate range between coherent quantum evolution and incoherent classical physics. We explore the asymmetric transmission through a classical analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) mesoscopic ring that supports a 3:1 asymmetry in transmission times, augmented with lossy features that act preferentially on the longer-lingering waves. Such a device is realized as a linear microwave graph utilizing a gyrator to create the 3:1 transmission time delay asymmetry, along with both homogeneous and localized losses, to produce an imbalance in wave transmission through the device. We demonstrate asymmetric transmission through the microwave-ring graph as a function of loss in both simulation and experiment, and in both the frequency- and time-domain. The microwave ring-graph results are compared to a numerical simulation representative of a class of recent models proposing dephasing-induced transport asymmetry in few-channel quantum systems, and parallels are noted.</description>
