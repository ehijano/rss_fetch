      <title>Charged-Particle Multiplicity Dependence of Net-Proton Cumulants in Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of cumulants of event-by-event net-proton distribution at mid-rapidity and their ratios up to the sixth order as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru(isobars) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) of 200 GeV. The data are collected from the STAR experiment with a total of two billion events recorded for each collision system. The measurements are compared with those obtained from p+p and Au+Au collision systems at the same center-of-mass energy. The higher-order cumulant ratios ($C_4/C_2$, $C_5/C_1$, and $C_6/C_2$) show an overall decreasing trend as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity across systems. The isobar results align with the Au+Au trends within uncertainties. The observations are compared with calculations from Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) that include a quark-hadron crossover. The systematic behavior of the higher-order cumulant ratios shows that, overall, they progressively approach LGT predictions with increasing multiplicity within uncertainties. This could imply that the medium created in these heavy-ion collisions gradually evolves into thermalized QCD matter undergoing a crossover transition with multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Validating a Machine Learning Approach to Identify Quenched Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet quenching is a phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions arising from jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Its study is complicated by the interplay of multiple physics processes that affect jet observables. In addition, detector effects may influence the results and must be accounted for when identifying quenched jets. We employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on jet substructure, incorporating parton shower history, to predict jet-by-jet quenching levels. Using photon-jet samples from the \textsc{Jewel} event generator, we show that the LSTM predictions strongly correlate with true jet energy loss. This validates that the model effectively learns the features of jet-QGP interaction. We simulate detector effects using \textsc{Delphes} simulation framework and demonstrate that the method identifies quenching effects in a realistic environment. We test the approach with photon-jet momentum imbalance, jet fragmentation function, and jet shape, which were not included in the training, confirming its ability to distinguish true quenching features.</description>

      <title>A prototype neutron-detector array for future deep-underground s-process studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a novel neutron-detection approach employing an EJ-309 liquid scintillator surrounded by six 3He proportional counters. Tests were performed at the FRANZ facility of the Goethe-University Frankfurt using the 7Li(p,n0)7Be reaction, producing neutrons across energies 50-720 keV. The scintillator's neutron energy quenching is determined, and its neutron/gamma-ray discrimination performance is evaluated. The lowest detectable neutron energy is 163 keV. EJ-309 - 3He counter neutron coincidences are compared with those from simulations. This array forms the prototype of a larger design, called scintillator-3He array for deep-underground experiments on the S-process, currently undergoing construction and testing for an upcoming deep-underground study of the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction cross-section at the freshly-commissioned Bellotti Ion Beam facility of the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. This upcoming project is expected to achieve exceptionally low sensitivity for measuring the cross section at energies of interest for the astrophysical 'weak' and 'main' slow neutron-capture processes.</description>

      <title>Optical studies of scintillation detectors for precision beta-energy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents optical calculations and simulations for scintillation detectors used in precision measurements of beta-particle energy spectra. Particular attention is given to Cherenkov photons and the impact of the light detection efficiency in the detector ensemble. We present an approach to estimate this light detection efficiency from the measured energy resolution of a detector. This is essential for the inclusion of scintillation photons in optical tracking Monte-Carlo simulations. A method to account for possible saturation and cross-talk of silicon photo-multipliers is also discussed. The impact of these effects is quantified in terms of systematic shifts in the extraction of the Fierz interference term from measurements of beta-energy spectra using scintillator detectors.</description>

      <title>$^{42}$Ar Production and Injection to a Liquid Argon Environment for Background Mitigation Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmosphere-sourced argon contains traces of $^{42}$Ar, whose $\beta^-$-decaying progeny $^{42}$K represents a significant intrinsic background for rare-event experiments using liquid argon (LAr) as detector or shielding medium. Understanding and mitigating this background is crucial for current and future large-scale detectors in neutrino and dark-matter physics. To enable controlled studies of $^{42}$K behavior and suppression techniques, $^{42}$Ar was produced by irradiating natural argon with 34 MeV $^{7}$Li$^{3+}$ ions at the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium tandem accelerator, using beam currents of $101 \pm 5$ nA and $140 \pm 5$ nA, yielding $476 \pm 9$ Bq within two weeks, corresponding to a production rate of $\sim 1 \times 10^{6}$ atoms$\,$s$^{-1}$. The activated argon was injected into the one-ton SCARF cryostat, where two HPGe detectors monitored the subsequent $^{42}$K activity build-up. A time-dependent model describing $^{42}$Ar mixing and $^{42}$K equilibration in LAr yielded characteristic mixing time constants between one and two days. The established production and injection capability provides a reproducible platform for high-statistics $^{42}$K background studies, essential for developing and validating suppression strategies for next-generation LAr-based rare-event experiments such as LEGEND-1000.</description>

      <title>The $Z\alpha^2$ correction to superallowed beta decays in effective field theory and implications for $|V_{ud}|$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superallowed ($0^+\rightarrow0^+$) beta decays currently provide the most precise extraction of quark mixing in the Standard Model. Their interpretation as a measurement of $|V_{ud}|$ relies on a reliable first-principles computation of QED radiative corrections expressed as a series in $Z\alpha$ and $\alpha$. In this work, we provide the first model-independent result for two-loop, $O(Z\alpha^2)$, long-distance radiative corrections where the nuclei are treated as heavy point-like particles.
  We use renormalization group analysis to obtain new results at $O(Z\alpha^3)$ for the coefficient of double-logarithms in the ratio of the maximal beta energy to the inverse nuclear size, $\Em/R^{-1}$. We use the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem to obtain new results at $O(Z^2\alpha^3)$ for the coefficient of logarithms in the ratio of maximal beta energy to the electron mass, $\log(2\Em/\me)$. We identify a structure-dependent, and therefore short-distance, contribution to the traditional $Z\alpha^2$ correction that should be revisited.. We provide the first comprehensive update to the long-distance corrections in almost forty years and comment on the impact of our findings for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. We find that shifts in the long-distance corrections are $2.5\times$ larger than past estimates of their uncertainty, $1.5\times$ larger than the statistical uncertainty from the combined fit of superallowed decays, and about $1/2$ the size of estimated systematic error, which stems dominantly from nuclear structure effects.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed beta decays at $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays with a heavy-particle effective field theory that systematically describes the interactions of low-energy ultrasoft photons with nuclei. We calculate two-loop virtual and one-loop real-virtual amplitudes by reducing the Feynman integrals to a set of master integrals, which we solve analytically using a variety of techniques. These techniques can be applied to other phenomenologically interesting observables. The ultrasoft corrections can then be combined with contributions arising from the exchange of potential photons to obtain the complete $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ correction to the decay rate, with resummation of large logarithms of the electron energy times the nuclear radius. We find that $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ ultrasoft loops induce a relative correction to the decay rate that ranges from $0.7 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{10}$C to $3.6 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{54}$Co, and will thus impact the extraction of $V_{ud}$ at the permille level. We show that the inclusion of these corrections reduces the residual renormalization scale dependence of the decay rate to a negligible level, making missing ultrasoft perturbative corrections a subdominant source of theoretical error.</description>
