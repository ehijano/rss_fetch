      <title>Global dynamical structures from infinitesimal data</title>

Abstract: Discovering mechanisms underlying the behaviors of complex, high dimensional, and nonlinear dynamical systems is a central goal of the natural and synthetic sciences. Breakthroughs in machine learning in concert with increasing capacities for computation and data collection have enabled the use of trajectory measurements for learning predictive models. However, rigorous approaches for interpreting mechanisms from such models remain elusive, and asymptotic prediction accuracy suffers if the model does not capture important state space structures (e.g., attracting invariant sets). These limitations are especially pressing for system-level behaviors such as whole-body locomotion, where discontinuous, transient, and multiscale phenomena are common and prior models are rare. To take the next step towards a theory and practice for dynamical inference of complex multiscale systems in biology and beyond, we introduce VERT, a framework for learning the attracting sets that characterize global system behavior without recourse to learning a global model. Our approach is based on an infinitesimal-local-global (ILG) framework for estimating the proximity of any sampled state to the attracting set, if one exists, with formal accuracy guarantees. We demonstrate our approach on phenomenological and physical oscillators with hierarchical and impulsive dynamics, finding sensitivity to both global and intermediate attractors composed in sequence and parallel. Application of VERT to human running kinematics data reveals insight into control modules that stabilize task-level dynamics, supporting a longstanding neuromechanical control hypothesis. The VERT framework thus enables rigorous inference of underlying dynamical structure even for systems where learning a global dynamics model is impractical or impossible.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and spatiotemporal chaos in relativistic degenerate plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the nonlinear interactions of high-frequency circularly polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves and low-frequency electron-acoustic (EA) density perturbations driven by the EM wave ponderomotive force in relativistic plasmas with two groups of electrons--the population of relativistic degenerate dense electrons (bulk plasma) and the sparse relativistic nondegenerate (classical) electrons, and immobile singly charged positive ions. By pattern selection, we show that many solitary patterns can be generated and drenched through modulational instability of EM waves at different spatial length scales and that the EM wave radiation spectra emanating from compact astrophysical objects may not settle into stable envelope solitons but into different incoherent states, including the emergence of temporal and spatiotemporal chaos due to collisions and fusions among the patterns with strong EA wave emission. The appearance of these states is confirmed by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent spectra, correlation function, and mutual information. As a result, the redistribution of wave energy from initially excited many solitary patterns at large scales to a few new incoherent patterns with small wavelengths in the system occurs, leading to the onset of turbulence in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Recurrence, Attention, and Gating: Investigating the transferability of Transformers and Gated Recurrent Neural Networks in forecasting of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning architectures, including transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have revolutionized forecasting in applications ranging from text processing to extreme weather. Notably, advanced network architectures, tuned for applications such as natural language processing, are transferable to other tasks such as spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. However, there is a scarcity of ablation studies to illustrate the key components that enable this forecasting accuracy. The absence of such studies, although explainable due to the associated computational cost, intensifies the belief that these models ought to be considered as black boxes. In this work, we decompose the key architectural components of the most powerful neural architectures, namely gating and recurrence in RNNs, and attention mechanisms in transformers. Then, we synthesize and build novel hybrid architectures from the standard blocks, performing ablation studies to identify which mechanisms are effective for each task. The importance of considering these components as hyper-parameters that can augment the standard architectures is exhibited on various forecasting datasets, from the spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics of the multiscale Lorenz 96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, as well as standard real world time-series benchmarks. A key finding is that neural gating and attention improves the performance of all standard RNNs in most tasks, while the addition of a notion of recurrence in transformers is detrimental. Furthermore, our study reveals that a novel, sparsely used, architecture which integrates Recurrent Highway Networks with neural gating and attention mechanisms, emerges as the best performing architecture in high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Unitary k-designs from random number-conserving quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local random circuits scramble efficiently and accordingly have a range of applications in quantum information and quantum dynamics. With a global $U(1)$ charge however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. We establish two results using the statistical mechanics of $k$-fold replicated circuits. First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a $k_c$-design with $k_c = O(L^d)$ for a system in $d$ spatial dimensions with linear dimension $L$. Second, for $k &lt; k_c$, we derive bounds on the depth $\tau$ required for the circuit to converge to an approximate $k$-design. The depth is lower bounded by diffusion $k L^2 \ln(L) \lesssim \tau$. In contrast, without number conservation $\tau \sim \text{poly}(k) L$. The convergence of the circuit ensemble is controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum statistical model which spontaneously breaks $k$ $U(1)$ symmetries. We conjecture that the associated Goldstone modes set the spectral gap for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions, leading to an upper bound $\tau \lesssim k L^{d+2}$.</description>
