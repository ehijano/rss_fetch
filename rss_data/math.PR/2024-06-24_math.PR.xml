      <title>An Optimal Selection Problem Associated with the Poisson Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cowan and Zabczyk (1978) introduced a continuous-time generalisation of the secretary problem, where offers arrive at epochs of a homogeneous Poisson process. We expand their work to encompass the last success problem under the Karamata-Stirling record profile. In this setting, the $k$th trial is a success with probability $p_k=\theta/(\theta+k-1)$ and parameter $\theta &gt; 0$. In the best choice setting ($\theta=1$), the myopic strategy is optimal, and the proof hinges on verifying the monotonicity of certain critical roots. We establish this crucial result in the last-success case by exploiting a connection to the sign of the derivative in the first parameter of a quotient of Kummer's hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we address the case of inhomogeneous arrivals by employing a point process of successes and illustrate this approach with examples of intensity functions. Finally, we derive bounds and asymptotics of the critical roots, strengthening and improving the findings of Ciesielski and Zabczyk (1979).</description>

      <title>Homogenization of semilinear parabolic PDEs with the third boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogenization of the third boundary value problem for semilinear parabolic PDEs with rapidly oscillating periodic coefficients in the weak sense. Our method is entirely probabilistic, and builds upon the work of [28] and [3]. Backward stochastic differential equations with singular coefficients play an important role in our approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we apply a combination of Malliavin calculus and Stein's method in the framework of probability approximations. The specific problems we tackle with these methods are motivated by probabilistic models in cosmology (Part I: Quantitative CLTs for non linear functionals of random hyperspherical harmonics) and finance (Part II: The fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in rough volatility modelling). In this second part we also apply techniques from Large Deviations theory (Section: Short-time asymptotics for non self-similar stochastic volatility models).</description>

      <title>On some mixtures of the Kies distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore some mixtures of Kies distributions -- discrete and continuous. The last ones are also known as compound distributions. Some conditions for convergence are established. We study the probabilistic properties of these mixtures. Special attention is taken to the so-called Hausdorff saturation. Several particular cases are considered -- bimodal and multimodal distributions, and mixtures based on binomial, geometric, exponential, gamma, and beta distributions. Some numerical experiments for real-life tasks are provided.</description>

      <title>Rates of Convergence of the Magnetization in the Tensor Curie-Weiss Potts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive distributional convergence rates for the magnetization vector in the tensor Curie-Weiss Potts model. Limit theorems for the magnetization vector have been derived recently in Bhowal &amp; Mukherjee (2023), where several phase transition phenomena in terms of the scaling of the (centered) magnetization and its asymptotic distribution were established, depending upon the position of the true parameters in the parameter space. In the current work, we establish Berry-Esseen type results for the magnetization vector, specifying its rate of convergence at these different phases. At "most" points in the parameter space, this rate is $N^{-1/2}$ ($N$ being the size of the Curie-Weiss network), while at some "special" points, the rate is either $N^{-1/4}$ or $N^{-1/6}$, depending upon the behavior of the fourth derivative of a certain negative free energy function at these special points.</description>

      <title>Weak recovery, hypothesis testing, and mutual information in stochastic block models and planted factor graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is a canonical model of communities in random graphs. It was introduced in the social sciences and statistics as a model of communities, and in theoretical computer science as an average case model for graph partitioning problems under the name of the ``planted partition model.'' Given a sparse stochastic block model, the two standard inference tasks are: (i) Weak recovery: can we estimate the communities with non trivial overlap with the true communities? (ii) Detection/Hypothesis testing: can we distinguish if the sample was drawn from the block model or from a random graph with no community structure with probability tending to $1$ as the graph size tends to infinity?
  In this work, we show that for sparse stochastic block models, the two inference tasks are equivalent except at a critical point. That is, weak recovery is information theoretically possible if and only if detection is possible. We thus find a strong connection between these two notions of inference for the model. We further prove that when detection is impossible, an explicit hypothesis test based on low degree polynomials in the adjacency matrix of the observed graph achieves the optimal statistical power. This low degree test is efficient as opposed to the likelihood ratio test, which is not known to be efficient. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic mutual information between the observed network and the community structure exhibits a phase transition at the weak recovery threshold.
  Our results are proven in much broader settings including the hypergraph stochastic block models and general planted factor graphs. In these settings we prove that the impossibility of weak recovery implies contiguity and provide a condition which guarantees the equivalence of weak recovery and detection.</description>

      <title>Explosion by Killing and Maximum Principle in Symmetric Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keller and Lenz \cite{KL} define a concept of {\it stochastic completeness at infinity} (SCI) for a regular symmetric Dirichlet form $(\cE,\cF)$. We show that (SCI) can be characterized probabilistically by using the predictable part $\zeta^p$ of the life time $\zeta$ of the symmetric Markov process $X=({\bf P}_x,X_t)$ generated by $(\cE,\cF)$, that is, (SCI) is equivalent to $\bfP_x(\zeta=\zeta^p&lt;\infty)=0$. We define a concept, {\it explosion by killing} (EK), by $\bfP_x(\zeta=\zeta^i&lt;\infty)=1$. Here $\zeta^i$ is the totally inaccessible part of $\zeta$. We see that (EK) is equivalent to (SCI) and $\bfP_x(\zeta=\infty)=1$. Let $X^{\rm res}$ be the {\it resurrected process} generated by the {\it resurrected form}, a regular Dirichlet form constructed by removing the killing part from $(\cE, \cF)$. Extending work of Masamune and Schmidt (\cite{MS}), we show that (EK) is also equivalent to the ordinary conservation property of time changed process of $X^{\rm res}$ by $A^k_t$, where the $A^k_t$ is the positive continuous additive functional in the Revuz correspondence to the killing measure $k$ in the Beurling-Deny formula (Theorem \ref{ma-sh}). We consider the maximum principle for Schr\"odinger-type operator $\cL^\mu=\cL-\mu$. Here $\cL$ is the self-adjoint operator associated with $(\cE,\cF)$ %with non-local part and $\mu$ is a Green-tight Kato measure. Let $\lambda(\mu)$ be the principal eigenvalue of the trace of $(\cE,\cF)$ relative to $\mu$. We prove that if (EK) holds, then $\lambda(\mu)&gt;1$ implies a Liouville property that every bounded solution to $\cL^\mu u=0$ is zero quasi-everywhere and that the {\it refined maximum principle} in the sense of Berestycki-Nirenberg-Varadhan \cite{BNV} holds for $\cL^\mu$ if and only if $\lambda(\mu)&gt;1$ (Theorem \ref{RMP}).</description>

      <title>Large deviations for 2D Stochastic Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a large deviation principle for 2D stochastic Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes equation perturbed by a small multiplicative noise. The main difficulties come from the lack of a suitable compact embedding into the space occupied by the solutions and the inherent complexity of equation. Finite dimensional projection arguments and introducing suitable stopping times play important roles.</description>

      <title>Genealogical processes of non-neutral population models under rapid mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that genealogical trees arising from a broad class of non-neutral models of population evolution converge to the Kingman coalescent under a suitable rescaling of time. As well as non-neutral biological evolution, our results apply to genetic algorithms encompassing the prominent class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The time rescaling we need differs slightly from that used in classical results for convergence to the Kingman coalescent, which has implications for the performance of different resampling schemes in SMC algorithms. In addition, our work substantially simplifies earlier proofs of convergence to the Kingman coalescent, and corrects an error common to several earlier results.</description>

      <title>From snapping out Brownian motions to Walsh's spider processes on star-like graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing matrices involved, we prove that a snapping-out Brownian motion with large permeability coefficients is a good approximation of Walsh's spider process on the star-like graph $K_{1,k}$. Thus, the latter process can be seen as a Brownian motion perturbed by a trace of semi-permeable membrane at the graph's center.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations of a self-interacting diffusion on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations in the average speed or current of a self-interacting diffusion (SID) on a ring, mimicking the non-Markovian behaviour of an agent influenced by its own path. We derive the SID's phase diagram, showing a delocalisation-localisation phase transition from self-repelling to self-attracting. Current fluctuations are analysed using: (i) an adiabatic approximation, where the system reaches its stationary distribution before developing current fluctuations, and (ii) an original extension of level 2.5 large deviations for Markov processes. The latter, combined with perturbation theory, provides an upper bound to current fluctuations, which is tight in the self-repelling region, while the former approximates current fluctuations well in all regimes. Both methods accurately estimate the asymptotic variance and suggests a phase transition at the onset of the localised regime.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the stability of optimal policies in the long-run stochastic control framework with an averaged risk-sensitive criterion for discrete-time MDPs on finite state-action space. In particular, we study the robustness of optimal controls when perturbations to the risk-aversion parameter are applied, and investigate the Blackwell property, together with its link to the risk-sensitive vanishing discount approximation framework. Finally, we present examples that help to better understand the intricacies of the risk-sensitive control framework.</description>

      <title>Generalized Measures of Population Synchrony</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronized behavior among individuals is a ubiquitous feature of populations. Understanding mechanisms of (de)synchronization demands meaningful, interpretable, computable quantifications of synchrony, relevant to measurements that can be made of dynamic populations. Despite the importance to analyzing and modeling populations, existing notions of synchrony often lack rigorous definitions, may be specialized to a particular experimental system and/or measurement, or may have undesirable properties that limit their utility. We introduce a notion of synchrony for populations of individuals occupying a compact metric space that depends on the Fr\'{e}chet variance of the distribution of individuals. We establish several fundamental and desirable mathematical properties of this synchrony measure, including continuity and invariance to metric scaling. We establish a general approximation result that controls the disparity between synchrony in the true space and the synchrony observed through a discretization of state space, as may occur when observable states are limited by measurement constraints. We develop efficient algorithms to compute synchrony in a variety of state spaces, including all finite state spaces and empirical distributions on the circle, and provide accessible implementations in an open-source Python module. To demonstrate the usefulness of the synchrony measure in biological applications, we investigate several biologically relevant models of mechanisms that can alter the dynamics of synchrony over time, and reanalyze published data concerning the dynamics of the intraerythrocytic developmental cycles of $\textit{Plasmodium}$ parasites. We anticipate that the rigorous definition of population synchrony and the mathematical and biological results presented here will be broadly useful in analyzing and modeling populations in a variety of contexts.</description>

      <title>A projected Euler Method for Random Periodic Solutions of Semi-linear SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work introduces and investigates an explicit time discretization scheme, called the projected Euler method, to numerically approximate random periodic solutions of semi-linear SDEs under non-globally Lipschitz conditions. The existence of the random periodic solution is demonstrated as the limit of the pull-back of the discretized SDE. Without relying on a priori high-order moment bounds of the numerical approximations, the mean square convergence rate is proved to be order 0.5 for SDEs with multiplicative noise and order 1 for SDEs with additive noise. Numerical examples are also provided to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of the Nonlinear Stochastic Fokker--Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation. This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of nonlocally interacting particles affected by a common source of noise. The system is directed by a controller that acts on the drift term with the goal of minimising a cost functional. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation, prove the existence of optimal controls, and formulate a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) that provides necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the control problem. The adjoint process arising in the SMP is characterised by a nonlocal (semi)linear backward SPDE for which we study existence and uniqueness. We also rigorously connect the control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation to the control of the corresponding McKean--Vlasov SDE that describes the motion of a representative particle. Our work extends existing results for the control of the Fokker--Planck equation to nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In particular, the sufficient SMP, which we obtain by exploiting the special structure of the Fokker--Planck equation, seems to be novel even in the linear deterministic setting. We illustrate our results with an application to a model of government interventions in financial systems, supplemented by numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric bootstrap of high-dimensional sample covariance matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new "$(m,mp/n)$ out of $(n,p)$" sampling-with-replace\-ment bootstrap for eigenvalue statistics of high-dimensional sample covariance matrices based on $n$ independent $p$-dimensional random vectors. In the high-dimensional scenario $p/n\rightarrow c\in (0,\infty)$, this fully nonparametric and computationally tractable bootstrap is shown to consistently reproduce the empirical spectral measure if $m/n\rightarrow 0$. If $m^2/n\rightarrow 0$, it approximates correctly the distribution of linear spectral statistics. The crucial component is a suitably defined Representative Subpopulation Condition which is shown to be verified in a large variety of situations. Our proofs are conducted under minimal moment requirements and incorporate delicate results on non-centered quadratic forms, combinatorial trace moments estimates as well as a conditional bootstrap martingale CLT which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Surface Signature and Rough Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel transport, or path development, provides a rich characterization of paths which preserves the underlying algebraic structure of concatenation. The path signature is universal among such maps: any (translation-invariant) parallel transport factors uniquely through the path signature. Furthermore, the path signature is a central object in the theory of rough paths, which provides an integration theory for highly irregular paths. A fundamental result is Lyons' extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough paths, and in turn provides a way to compute parallel transport of arbitrarily irregular paths. In this article, we consider the notion of surface holonomy, a generalization of parallel transport to the higher dimensional setting of surfaces parametrized by rectangular domains, which preserves the higher algebraic structures of horizontal and vertical concatenation. Building on work of Kapranov, we introduce the surface signature, which is universal among surface holonomy maps with respect to continuous 2-connections. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a rough surface and prove a surface extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough surfaces. By exploiting the universal property of the surface signature, this provides a method to compute the surface holonomy of arbitrarily irregular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Equality of critical parameters for percolation of Gaussian free field level-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.07735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider upper level-sets of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb Z^d$, for $d\geq 3$, above a given real-valued height parameter $h$. As $h$ varies, this defines a canonical percolation model with strong, algebraically decaying correlations. We prove that three natural critical parameters associated to this model, respectively describing a well-ordered subcritical phase, the emergence of an infinite cluster, and the onset of a local uniqueness regime in the supercritical phase, actually coincide. At the core of our proof lies a new interpolation scheme aimed at integrating out the long-range dependence of the Gaussian free field. Due to the strength of correlations, its successful implementation requires that we work in an effectively critical regime. Our analysis relies extensively on certain novel renormalization techniques that bring into play all relevant scales simultaneously. The approach in this article paves the way to a complete understanding of the off-critical phases for strongly correlated disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Mosco convergence of gradient forms with non-convex interaction potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a new approach to address Mosco convergence of gradient-type Dirichlet forms, $\mathcal E^N$ on $L^2(E,\mu_N)$ for $N\in\mathbb N$, in the framework of converging Hilbert spaces by K.~Kuwae and T.~Shioya. The basic assumption is weak measure convergence of the family ${(\mu_N)}_{N}$ on the state space $E$ - either a separable Hilbert space or a locally convex topological vector space. Apart from that, the conditions on ${(\mu_N)}_{N}$ try to impose as little restrictions as possible. The problem has fully been solved if the family ${(\mu_N)}_{N}$ contain only log-concave measures, due to L.~Ambrosio, G.~Savar\'e and L.~Zambotti, 2009. However for a large class of convergence problems the assumption of log-concavity fails. The article suggests a way to overcome this hindrance, as it presents a new approach. Combining the theory of Dirichlet forms with methods from numerical analysis we find abstract criteria for Mosco convergence of standard gradient forms with varying reference measures. These include cases in which the measures are not log-concave. To demonstrate the accessibility of our abstract theory we discuss a first application, generalizing an approximation result by S.~K.~Bounebache and L.~Zambotti, 2014.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional branching Brownian motion in spatially random branching environment (BBMRE) and show that for almost every realisation of the environment, the distributions of the maximal particle of the BBMRE re-centred around its median are tight as time evolves. This result is in stark contrast to the fact that the transition fronts in the solution to the randomised Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovskii--Piskunov (F-KPP) equation are, in general, not bounded uniformly in time. In particular, this highlights that -- when compared to the settings of homogeneous branching Brownian motion and the F-KPP equation in a homogeneous environment -- the introduction of a random environment leads to a much more intricate behaviour.</description>

      <title>Large Sample Theory for Bures-Wasserstein Barycentres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem in the Bures-Wasserstein space of covariance operators -- or equivalently centred Gaussian measures -- over a general separable Hilbert space. Specifically, we show that under a minimal first-moment condition, empirical barycentre sequences indexed by sample size are almost certainly relatively compact, with accumulation points comprising population barycentres. We give a sufficient regularity condition for the limit to be unique. When the limit is unique, we also establish a central limit theorem under a refined pair of moment and regularity conditions. Finally, we prove strong operator convergence of the empirical optimal transport maps to their population counterparts. Though our results naturally extend finite-dimensional counterparts, including associated regularity conditions, our techniques are distinctly different owing to the functional nature of the problem in the general setting. A key element is the elicitation of a class of compact sets that reflect an \emph{ordered} Heine-Borel property of the Bures-Wasserstein space.</description>

      <title>Meeting, coalescence and consensus time on random directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Markovian dynamics on a typical realization of the so-called Directed Configuration Model (DCM), that is, a random directed graph with prescribed in- and out-degrees. In this random geometry, we study the meeting time of two random walks on a typical realization of the graph starting at stationarity, the coalescence time for a system of coalescent random walks, and the consensus time of the voter model. Indeed, it is known that the latter three quantities are related to each other when the underlying sequence of graphs satisfies certain mean field conditions. Such conditions can be summarized by requiring a fast mixing time of the random walk and some anti-concentration of its stationary distribution: properties that a typical random directed graph is known to have under natural assumptions on the degree sequence. In this paper we show that, for a typical large graph from the DCM ensemble, the distribution of the meeting time is well-approximated by an exponential random variable and we provide the first-order approximation of its expectation, showing that the latter is linear in the size of the graph, and the preconstant depends on some easy statistics of the degree sequence. As a byproduct, we are able to analyze the effect of the degree sequence in changing the meeting, coalescence and consensus time. Our approach follows the classical idea of converting meeting into hitting times of a proper collapsed chain, which we control by the so-called First Visit Time Lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1936 Mills Futurity slot machine had the feature that, if a player loses 10 times in a row, the 10 lost coins are returned. Ethier and Lee (2010) studied a generalized version of this machine, with 10 replaced by deterministic parameter J. They established the Parrondo effect for a hypothetical two-armed machine with the Futurity award. Specifically, arm A and arm B, played individually, are asymptotically fair, but when alternated ran-domly (the so-called random mixture strategy), the casino makes money in the long run. They also considered the nonrandom periodic pattern strategy for patterns with r As and s Bs (e.g., ABABB if r = 2 and s = 3). They established the Parrondo effect if r + s divides J, and conjectured it in four other situations, including the case J = 2 with r &gt;= 1 and s &gt;= 1. We prove the conjecture in the latter case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale-free configuration models are intimately connected to power law Galton-Watson trees. It is known that contact process epidemics can propagate on these trees and therefore these networks with arbitrarily small infection rate, and this continues to be true after uniformly immunising a small positive proportion of vertices. So, we instead immunise those with largest degree: above a threshold for the maximum permitted degree, we discover the epidemic with immunisation has survival probability similar to without, by duality corresponding to comparable metastable density. With maximal degree below a threshold on the same order, this survival probability is severely reduced or zero.</description>

Abstract: We prove large and moderate deviations for the output of Gaussian fully connected neural networks. The main achievements concern deep neural networks (i.e., when the model has more than one hidden layer) and hold for bounded and continuous pre-activation functions. However, for deep neural networks fed by a single input, we have results even if the pre-activation is ReLU. When the network is shallow (i.e., there is exactly one hidden layer) the large and moderate principles hold for quite general pre-activations and in an infinite-dimensional setting.</description>

We deduce quantitative bounds on the merging time of the distributions for the chain started at two arbitrary points and we illustrate these new results with examples.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of probabilistic cellular automata that are capable of exhibiting rich dynamics such as synchronization and ergodicity and can be easily inferred from data. The system is a finite-state locally interacting Markov chain on a circular graph. Each site's subsequent state is random, with a distribution determined by its neighborhood's empirical distribution multiplied by a local transition matrix. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions on the local transition matrix for synchronization and ergodicity. Also, we introduce novel least squares estimators for inferring the local transition matrix from various types of data, which may consist of either multiple trajectories, a long trajectory, or ensemble sequences without trajectory information. Under suitable identifiability conditions, we show the asymptotic normality of these estimators and provide non-asymptotic bounds for their accuracy.</description>

      <title>Function approximation by neural nets in the mean-field regime: Entropic regularization and controlled McKean-Vlasov dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.01987v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of function approximation by two-layer neural nets with random weights that are "nearly Gaussian" in the sense of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our setting is the mean-field limit, where the finite population of neurons in the hidden layer is replaced by a continuous ensemble. We show that the problem can be phrased as global minimization of a free energy functional on the space of (finite-length) paths over probability measures on the weights. This functional trades off the $L^2$ approximation risk of the terminal measure against the KL divergence of the path with respect to an isotropic Brownian motion prior. We characterize the unique global minimizer and examine the dynamics in the space of probability measures over weights that can achieve it. In particular, we show that the optimal path-space measure corresponds to the F\"ollmer drift, the solution to a McKean-Vlasov optimal control problem closely related to the classic Schr\"odinger bridge problem. While the F\"ollmer drift cannot in general be obtained in closed form, thus limiting its potential algorithmic utility, we illustrate the viability of the mean-field Langevin diffusion as a finite-time approximation under various conditions on entropic regularization. Specifically, we show that it closely tracks the F\"ollmer drift when the regularization is such that the minimizing density is log-concave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of viscosity solutions of fractional semilinear elliptic PDEs of index $\alpha \in (1,2)$ with polynomial gradient nonlinearities on $d$-dimensional balls, $d\geq 2$. Our approach uses a tree-based probabilistic representation of solutions and their partial derivatives using $\alpha$-stable branching processes, and allows us to take into account gradient nonlinearities not covered by deterministic finite difference methods so far. In comparison with the existing literature on the regularity of solutions, no polynomial order condition is imposed on gradient nonlinearities. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the accuracy of the method in dimension $d=10$, solving a challenge encountered with the use of deterministic finite difference methods in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06285v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The {\em discrepancy} of a matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ is given by $\mathrm{DISC}(M) := \min_{\boldsymbol{x} \in \{-1,1\}^n} \|M\boldsymbol{x}\|_\infty$. An outstanding conjecture, attributed to Koml\'os, stipulates that $\mathrm{DISC}(M) = O(1)$, whenever $M$ is a Koml\'os matrix, that is, whenever every column of $M$ lies within the unit sphere. Our main result asserts that $\mathrm{DISC}(M + R/\sqrt{d}) = O(d^{-1/2})$ holds asymptotically almost surely, whenever $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ is Koml\'os, $R \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ is a Rademacher random matrix, $d = \omega(1)$, and $n = \omega(d \log d)$. The factor $d^{-1/2}$ normalising $R$ is essentially best possible and the dependency between $n$ and $d$ is asymptotically best possible. Our main source of inspiration is a result by Bansal, Jiang, Meka, Singla, and Sinha (ICALP 2022). They obtained an assertion similar to the one above in the case that the smoothing matrix is Gaussian. They asked whether their result can be attained with the optimal dependency $n = \omega(d \log d)$ in the case of Bernoulli random noise or any other types of discretely distributed noise; the latter types being more conducive for Smoothed Analysis in other discrepancy settings such as the Beck-Fiala problem. For Bernoulli noise, their method works if $n = \omega(d^2)$. In the case of Rademacher noise, we answer the question posed by Bansal, Jiang, Meka, Singla, and Sinha. Our proof builds upon their approach in a strong way and provides a discrete version of the latter. Breaking the $n = \omega(d^2)$ barrier and reaching the optimal dependency $n = \omega(d \log d)$ for Rademacher noise requires additional ideas expressed through a rather meticulous counting argument, incurred by the need to maintain a high level of precision all throughout the discretisation process.</description>

Abstract: The quantum thermal average plays a central role in describing the thermodynamic properties of a quantum system. Path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) is a prevailing approach for computing quantum thermal averages by approximating the quantum partition function as a classical isomorphism on an augmented space, enabling efficient classical sampling, but the theoretical knowledge of the ergodicity of the sampling is lacking. Parallel to the standard PIMD with $N$ ring polymer beads, we also study the Matsubara mode PIMD, where the ring polymer is replaced by a continuous loop composed of $N$ Matsubara modes. Utilizing the generalized $\Gamma$ calculus, we prove that both the Matsubara mode PIMD and the standard PIMD have uniform-in-$N$ ergodicity, i.e., the convergence rate towards the invariant distribution does not depend on the number of modes or beads $N$.</description>

      <title>Relaxed optimal control for the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, perturbed by a real-valued Wiener process. We add an external control to the effective field as an attempt to drive the magnetization to a desired state and also to control thermal fluctuations. We use the theory of Young measures to relax the given control problem along with the associated cost. We consider a control operator that can depend (possibly non-linearly) on both the control and the associated solution. Moreover, we consider a fairly general associated cost functional without any special convexity assumption. We use certain compactness arguments, along with the Jakubowski version of the Skorohod Theorem to show that the relaxed problem admits an optimal control.</description>

      <title>Fay Identities of Pfaffian Type for Hyperelliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish identities of Pfaffian type for the theta function associated with twice or half the period matrix of a hyperelliptic curve. They are implied by the large size asymptotic analysis of exact Pfaffian identities for expectation values of ratios of characteristic polynomials in ensembles of orthogonal or quaternionic self-dual random matrices. We show that they amount to identities for the theta function with the period matrix of a hyperelliptic curve, and in this form we reprove them by direct geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Cash non-additive risk measures: horizon risk and generalized entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Horizon risk (see arXiv:2301.04971) is studied in the context of cash non-additive fully-dynamic risk measures induced by BSDEs. Furthermore, we introduce a risk measure based on generalized Tsallis entropy which can dynamically evaluate the riskiness of losses considering both horizon risk and interest rate uncertainty. The new q-entropic risk measure on losses can be used as a quantification of capital requirement.</description>

      <title>Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. We prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models with different parameters in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results are a broad generalization of the results of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model) with different parameters.</description>

      <title>On maximizing the number of heads when you need to set aside at least one coin every round</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: You play the following game: you start out with $n$ coins that all have probability $p$ to land heads. You toss all of them and you then need to set aside at least one of them, which will not be tossed again. Now you repeat the process with the remaining coins. This continues (for at most $n$ rounds) until all coins have been set aside. Your goal is to maximize the total number of heads you end up with. In this paper we will prove that there exists a constant $p_0 \approx 0.5495021777642$ such that, if $p_0 &lt; p \le 1$ and the number of remaining coins is large enough, then it is optimal to set aside exactly one coin every round, unless all coins landed heads. When $\frac{1}{2} \le p \le p_0$, it is optimal to set aside exactly one coin every round, unless at most one coin came up tails. Let $v_{n,p}$ be the expected number of heads you obtain when using the optimal strategy. We will show that $v_{n,p}$ is larger than or equal to $v_{n-1,p} + 1$ for all $n \ge 3$ and all $p \ge \frac{1}{2}$. When $p &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ there are infinitely many $n$ for which this inequality does not hold. Finally, we will see that for every $p$ with $0 &lt; p \le 1$ the sequence $n - v_{n,p}$ is convergent.</description>
