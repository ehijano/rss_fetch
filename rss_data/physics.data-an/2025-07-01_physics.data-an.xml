      <title>Investigation of the performance of a GNN-based b-jet tagging method in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beauty-tagged jets (b-jets)-collimated sprays of particles originating from the fragmentation of beauty quarks produced in the initial hard scatterings-provide a unique probe of parton dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. In particular, energy loss patterns of low-$p_T$ b-jets traversing the QGP offer valuable insight into the strong interaction in its nonperturbative regime. CMS and ATLAS Collaborations at the LHC have studied b-jet production in Pb-Pb collisions. The results were limited to a high-$p_T$ region, because a major challenge at low-$p_T$ is the overwhelming number of background particles from QGP hadronisation, which severely hinders the effectiveness of conventional b-jet tagging techniques. To enable precise measurements in such complex environments, advanced tagging methods are required. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), capable of learning relational structures among jet constituents, represent a promising deep learning approach for b-jet identification. In this study, we adopt and adapt the GN1 model, initially developed by ATLAS, for use in Pb-Pb collision environments. We investigate the model's performance by applying it to jets embedded with Pb-Pb background particles, evaluating both tagging decisions and robustness against background contamination. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of GNN-based b-jet tagging under heavy-ion collision conditions, aiming to advance future precision studies of QGP-induced partonic energy loss.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of coupling strength and heterogeneity in a coupled oscillator model from macroscopic quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various macroscopic oscillations, such as the heartbeat and the flashing of fireflies, are created by synchronizing oscillatory units (oscillators). To elucidate the mechanism of synchronization, several coupled oscillator models have been devised and extensively analyzed. Although parameter estimation of these models has also been actively investigated, most of the proposed methods are based on the data from individual oscillators, not from macroscopic quantities. In the present study, we propose a Bayesian framework to estimate the model parameters of coupled oscillator models, using the time series data of the Kuramoto order parameter as the only given data. We adopt the exchange Monte Carlo method for the efficient estimation of the posterior distribution and marginal likelihood. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the validity of our method and examine the dependence of the estimation error on the observational noise and system size.</description>

      <title>Transition of AI Models in dependence of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of the score on noise in the data, and on the network size. As a result, we obtain the so-called "cognition transition" from good performance to zero with increasing noise. The understanding of this transition is of fundamental scientific and practical interest. We use concepts from statistical mechanics to understand how a changing finite size of models affects the cognition ability under the presence or corrupted data. On one hand, we study if there is a universal aspect in the transition to several models, on the other hand we go into detail how the approach of the cognition transition point can be captured quantitatively. Therefore, we use the so-called scaling approach from statistical mechanics and find a power-law behaviour of the transition width with increasing model size. Since our study is aimed at universal aspects we use well-know models and data for image classification. That way we avoid uncertainties in data handling or model setup. The practical implication of our results is a tool to estimate model sizes for a certain "universality class" of models, without the need to investigate large sizes, just by extrapolating the scaling results. In turn, that allows for cost reduction in hyperparameter studies. Here, we present first results on a concrete setup; we think that the understanding the mechanics of large system sizes is of fundamental interest for a further exploration of even larger models.</description>

      <title>Neural optical flow for planar and stereo PIV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural optical flow (NOF) offers improved accuracy and robustness over existing OF methods for particle image velocimetry (PIV). Unlike other OF techniques, which rely on discrete displacement fields, NOF parameterizes the physical velocity field using a continuous neural-implicit representation. This formulation enables efficient data assimilation and ensures consistent regularization across views for stereo PIV. The neural-implicit architecture provides significant data compression and supports a space-time formulation, facilitating the analysis of both steady and unsteady flows. NOF incorporates a differentiable, nonlinear image-warping operator that relates particle motion to intensity changes between frames. Discrepancies between the advected intensity field and observed images form the data loss, while soft constraints, such as Navier-Stokes residuals, enhance accuracy and enable direct pressure inference from PIV images. Additionally, mass continuity can be imposed as a hard constraint for both 2D and 3D flows. Implicit regularization is achieved by tailoring the network's expressivity to match a target flow's spectral characteristics. Results from synthetic planar and stereo PIV datasets, as well as experimental planar data, demonstrate NOF's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art wavelet-based OF and CC methods. Additionally, we highlight its potential broader applicability to techniques like background-oriented schlieren, molecular tagging velocimetry, and other advanced measurement systems.</description>

      <title>Distribution of singular values in large sample cross-covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes. This extends the Marchenko-Pastur result for the distribution of eigenvalues of empirical sample covariance matrices to singular values of empirical cross-covariances. Our results will help to establish statistical significance of cross-correlations in many data-science applications.</description>
