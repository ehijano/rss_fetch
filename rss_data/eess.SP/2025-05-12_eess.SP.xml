      <title>ECGDeDRDNet: A deep learning-based method for Electrocardiogram noise removal using a double recurrent dense network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are frequently corrupted by noise, such as baseline wander (BW), muscle artifacts (MA), and electrode motion (EM), which significantly degrade their diagnostic utility. To address this issue, we propose ECGDeDRDNet, a deep learning-based ECG Denoising framework leveraging a Double Recurrent Dense Network architecture. In contrast to traditional approaches, we introduce a double recurrent scheme to enhance information reuse from both ECG waveforms and the estimated clean image. For ECG waveform processing, our basic model employs LSTM layers cascaded with DenseNet blocks. The estimated clean ECG image, obtained by subtracting predicted noise components from the noisy input, is iteratively fed back into the model. This dual recurrent architecture enables comprehensive utilization of both temporal waveform features and spatial image details, leading to more effective noise suppression. Experimental results on the MIT-BIH dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to conventional image denoising methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM while also surpassing classical ECG denoising techniques in both SNR and RMSE.</description>

      <title>OccuEMBED: Occupancy Extraction Merged with Building Energy Disaggregation for Occupant-Responsive Operation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and emissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids become more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide flexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in enhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must prioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets. However, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized building operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate the potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy and system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building energy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at scale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy inference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a probabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable load disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design embeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships into deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to demonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared to various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1 scores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for continuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates with building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze system-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model lays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management systems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.</description>

      <title>Improving Local Air Quality Predictions Using Transfer Learning on Satellite Data and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution is a significant global health risk, contributing to millions of premature deaths annually. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a harmful pollutant, disproportionately affects urban areas where monitoring networks are often sparse. We propose a novel method for predicting NO2 concentrations at unmonitored locations using transfer learning with satellite and meteorological data. Leveraging the GraphSAGE framework, our approach integrates autoregression and transfer learning to enhance predictive accuracy in data-scarce regions like Bristol. Pre-trained on data from London, UK, our model achieves a 8.6% reduction in Normalised Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) and a 32.6% reduction in Gradient RMSE compared to a baseline model. This work demonstrates the potential of virtual sensors for cost-effective air quality monitoring, contributing to actionable insights for climate and health interventions.</description>

      <title>A critical note on the sideband peak count-index technique: failure for nonlinear damage characterization of impacted CFRP plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied contradicts material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value. To clarify the apparent contradiction of our results with the previously published statements, it is recommended that (a) our data are re-evaluated by independent researchers and (b) the experiments already published are repeated or (if sufficient data is available) also re-evaluated.</description>

      <title>A New k-Space Model for Non-Cartesian Fourier Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the past several decades, it has been popular to reconstruct Fourier imaging data using model-based approaches that can easily incorporate physical constraints and advanced regularization/machine learning priors. The most common modeling approach is to represent the continuous image as a linear combination of shifted "voxel" basis functions. Although well-studied and widely-deployed, this voxel-based model is associated with longstanding limitations, including high computational costs, slow convergence, and a propensity for artifacts. In this work, we reexamine this model from a fresh perspective, identifying new issues that may have been previously overlooked (including undesirable approximation, periodicity, and nullspace characteristics). Our insights motivate us to propose a new model that is more resilient to the limitations (old and new) of the previous approach. Specifically, the new model is based on a Fourier-domain basis expansion rather than the standard image-domain voxel-based approach. Illustrative results, which are presented in the context of non-Cartesian MRI reconstruction, demonstrate that the new model enables improved image quality (reduced artifacts) and/or reduced computational complexity (faster computations and improved convergence).</description>

      <title>AI-assisted Automatic Jump Detection and Height Estimation in Volleyball Using a Waist-worn IMU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical load of jumps plays a critical role in injury prevention for volleyball players. However, manual video analysis of jump activities is time-intensive and costly, requiring significant effort and expensive hardware setups. The advent of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and machine learning algorithms offers a convenient and efficient alternative. Despite this, previous research has largely focused on either jump classification or physical load estimation, leaving a gap in integrated solutions. This study aims to present a pipeline to automatically detect jumps and predict heights using data from a waist-worn IMU. The pipeline leverages a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MS-TCN) to detect jump segments in time-series data and classify the specific jump category. Subsequently, jump heights are estimated using three downstream regression machine learning models based on the identified segments. Our method is verified on a dataset comprising 10 players and 337 jumps. Compared to the result of VERT in height estimation (R-squared=-1.53), a commercial device commonly used in jump landing tasks, our method not only accurately identifies jump activities and their specific types (F1-score=0.90) but also demonstrates superior performance in height prediction (R-squared=0.50). This integrated solution offers a promising tool for monitoring physical load and mitigating injury risk in volleyball players.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Beamforming with Deep Reinforcement Learning in Sensing-Aided Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile users are prone to experience beam failure due to beam drifting in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Sensing can help alleviate beam drifting with timely beam changes and low overhead since it does not need user feedback. This work studies the problem of optimizing sensing-aided communication by dynamically managing beams allocated to mobile users. A multi-beam scheme is introduced, which allocates multiple beams to the users that need an update on the angle of departure (AoD) estimates and a single beam to the users that have satisfied AoD estimation precision. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) assisted method is developed to optimize the beam allocation policy, relying only upon the sensing echoes. For comparison, a heuristic AoD-based method using approximated Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for allocation is also presented. Both methods require neither user feedback nor prior state evolution information. Results show that the DRL-assisted method achieves a considerable gain in throughput than the conventional beam sweeping method and the AoD-based method, and it is robust to different user speeds.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS Design for Parameter Estimation With and Without Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the transmission of a complex-valued parameter vector from a transmitter to an intended receiver, considering both the presence and absence of an eavesdropper. The direct links from the transmitter to both the intended receiver and the eavesdropper are assumed to be blocked, and communications occur solely through cascaded channels facilitated by a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS). While previous research has considered this system under conventional (diagonal) RIS assistance, we extend the setup to incorporate BD-RIS and quantify the resulting improvement in estimation performance at the intended receiver. This performance is measured by the trace of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), or equivalently, the average Fisher information, while simultaneously limiting the estimation capability of the eavesdropper. We propose solutions and algorithms for optimizing the BD-RIS response matrix and demonstrate their effectiveness. Numerical results reveal that the BD-RIS provides a significant enhancement in estimation quality compared to conventional diagonal RIS architectures.</description>

      <title>Smooth optimization algorithms for global and locally low-rank regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many inverse problems and signal processing problems involve low-rank regularizers based on the nuclear norm. Commonly, proximal gradient methods (PGM) are adopted to solve this type of non-smooth problems as they can offer fast and guaranteed convergence. However, PGM methods cannot be simply applied in settings where low-rank models are imposed locally on overlapping patches; therefore, heuristic approaches have been proposed that lack convergence guarantees. In this work we propose to replace the nuclear norm with a smooth approximation in which a Huber-type function is applied to each singular value. By providing a theoretical framework based on singular value function theory, we show that important properties can be established for the proposed regularizer, such as: convexity, differentiability, and Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. Moreover, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularizer gradient, enabling the use of standard iterative gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., nonlinear conjugate gradient) that can easily address the case of overlapping patches and have well-known convergence guarantees. In addition, we provide a novel step-size selection strategy based on a quadratic majorizer of the line-search function that leverages the Huber characteristics of the proposed regularizer. Finally, we assess the proposed optimization framework by providing empirical results in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction in the context of locally low-rank models with overlapping patches.</description>

      <title>Turbo-ICL: In-Context Learning-Based Turbo Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework, inspired by large language models (LLMs), for soft-input soft-output channel equalization in coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed approach learns to infer posterior symbol distributions directly from a prompt of pilot signals and decoder feedback. A key innovation is the use of prompt augmentation to incorporate extrinsic information from the decoder output as additional context, enabling the ICL model to refine its symbol estimates iteratively across turbo decoding iterations. Two model variants, based on Transformer and state-space architectures, are developed and evaluated. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, when traditional linear assumptions break down, e.g., in the presence of low-resolution quantization, ICL equalizers consistently outperform conventional model-based baselines, even when the latter are provided with perfect channel state information. Results also highlight the advantage of Transformer-based models under limited training diversity, as well as the efficiency of state-space models in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>ADMM-Based Training for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, it suffers from low scalability and numerical imprecision. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability. We formulate the problem, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence properties, great potential, and possible new research directions to improve the method in a simulated proof-of-concept.</description>

      <title>Cardioformer: Advancing AI in ECG Analysis with Multi-Granularity Patching and ResNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification is crucial for automated cardiac disease diagnosis, yet existing methods often struggle to capture local morphological details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose Cardioformer, a novel multi-granularity hybrid model that integrates cross-channel patching, hierarchical residual learning, and a two-stage self-attention mechanism. Cardioformer first encodes multi-scale token embeddings to capture fine-grained local features and global contextual information and then selectively fuses these representations through intra- and inter-granularity self-attention. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark ECG datasets under subject-independent settings demonstrate that model consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines. Our Cardioformer model achieves the AUROC of 96.34$\pm$0.11, 89.99$\pm$0.12, and 95.59$\pm$1.66 in MIMIC-IV, PTB-XL and PTB dataset respectively outperforming PatchTST, Reformer, Transformer, and Medformer models. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, achieving 49.18% AUROC on PTB and 68.41% on PTB-XL when trained on MIMIC-IV. These findings underscore the potential of Cardioformer to advance automated ECG analysis, paving the way for more accurate and robust cardiovascular disease diagnosis. We release the source code at https://github.com/KMobin555/Cardioformer.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR. Audio demos are provided at: https://arraydps.github.io/ArrayDPSDemo/.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalizability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks via Error-Correcting Output Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) offer universal function approximation using univariate spline compositions without nonlinear activations. In this work, we integrate Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) into the KAN framework to transform multi-class classification into multiple binary tasks, improving robustness via Hamming-distance decoding. Our proposed KAN with ECOC method outperforms vanilla KAN on a challenging blood cell classification dataset, achieving higher accuracy under diverse hyperparameter settings. Ablation studies further confirm that ECOC consistently enhances performance across FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of ECOC with KAN for enhancing multi-class medical image classification performance.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Power Modeling and Energy Efficiency Maximization for Movable Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have recently garnered significant attention in wireless communications due to their capability to reshape wireless channels via local antenna movement within a confined region. However, to achieve accurate antenna movement, MA drivers introduce non-negligible mechanical power consumption, rendering energy efficiency (EE) optimization more critical compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. To address this problem, we develop in this paper a fundamental power consumption model for stepper motor-driven MA systems by resorting to basic electric motor theory. Based on this model, we formulate an EE maximization problem by jointly optimizing an MA's position, moving speed, and transmit power. However, this problem is difficult to solve optimally due to the intricate relationship between the mechanical power consumption and the design variables. To tackle this issue, we first uncover a hidden monotonicity of the EE performance with respect to the MA's moving speed. Then, we apply the Dinkelbach algorithm to obtain the optimal transmit power in a semi-closed form for any given MA position, followed by an enumeration to determine the optimal MA position. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the additional mechanical power consumption, the MA system can outperform the conventional FPA system in terms of EE.</description>

      <title>Learning Power Control Protocol for In-Factory 6G Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-X Subnetworks are envisioned to meet the stringent demands of short-range communication in diverse 6G use cases. In the context of In-Factory scenarios, effective power control is critical to mitigating the impact of interference resulting from potentially high subnetwork density. Existing approaches to power control in this domain have predominantly emphasized the data plane, often overlooking the impact of signaling overhead. Furthermore, prior work has typically adopted a network-centric perspective, relying on the assumption of complete and up-to-date channel state information (CSI) being readily available at the central controller. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to enable access points to autonomously learn both signaling and power control protocols in an In-Factory Subnetwork environment. By formulating the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and leveraging multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), the proposed approach achieves significant advantages. The simulation results demonstrate that the learning-based method reduces signaling overhead by a factor of 8 while maintaining a buffer flush rate that lags the ideal "Genie" approach by only 5%.</description>

      <title>Discretized Approximate Ancestral Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fourier Basis Density Model (FBM) was recently introduced as a flexible probability model for band-limited distributions, i.e. ones which are smooth in the sense of having a characteristic function with limited support around the origin. Its density and cumulative distribution functions can be efficiently evaluated and trained with stochastic optimization methods, which makes the model suitable for deep learning applications. However, the model lacked support for sampling. Here, we introduce a method inspired by discretization--interpolation methods common in Digital Signal Processing, which directly take advantage of the band-limited property. We review mathematical properties of the FBM, and prove quality bounds of the sampled distribution in terms of the total variation (TV) and Wasserstein--1 divergences from the model. These bounds can be used to inform the choice of hyperparameters to reach any desired sample quality. We discuss these results in comparison to a variety of other sampling techniques, highlighting tradeoffs between computational complexity and sampling quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Echosounders are high-frequency sonar systems used to sense fish and zooplankton underwater. Their deployment on a variety of ocean observing platforms is generating vast amounts of data at an unprecedented speed from the oceans. Efficient and integrative analysis of these data, whether across different echosounder instruments or in combination with other oceanographic datasets, is crucial for understanding marine ecosystem response to the rapidly changing climate. Here we present Echopype, an open-source Python software library designed to address this need. By standardizing data as labeled, multi-dimensional arrays encoded in the widely embraced netCDF data model following a community convention, Echopype enhances the interoperability of echosounder data, making it easier to explore and use. By leveraging scientific Python libraries optimized for distributed computing, Echopype achieves computational scalability, enabling efficient processing in both local and cloud computing environments. Echopype's modularized package structure further provides a unified framework for expanding support for additional instrument raw data formats and incorporating new analysis functionalities. We plan to continue developing Echopype by supporting and collaborating with the echosounder user community, and envision that the growth of this package will catalyze the integration of echosounder data into broader regional and global ocean observation strategies.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Evasion Attacks in Federated Learning-Based Signal Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in leveraging federated learning (FL) for radio signal classification (SC) tasks has shown promise but FL-based SC remains susceptible to model poisoning adversarial attacks. These adversarial attacks mislead the ML model training process, damaging ML models across the network and leading to lower SC performance. In this work, we seek to mitigate model poisoning adversarial attacks on FL-based SC by proposing the Underlying Server Defense of Federated Learning (USD-FL). Unlike existing server-driven defenses, USD-FL does not rely on perfect network information, i.e., knowing the quantity of adversaries, the adversarial attack architecture, or the start time of the adversarial attacks. Our proposed USD-FL methodology consists of deriving logits for devices' ML models on a reserve dataset, comparing pair-wise logits via 1-Wasserstein distance and then determining a time-varying threshold for adversarial detection. As a result, USD-FL effectively mitigates model poisoning attacks introduced in the FL network. Specifically, when baseline server-driven defenses do have perfect network information, USD-FL outperforms them by (i) improving final ML classification accuracies by at least 6%, (ii) reducing false positive adversary detection rates by at least 10%, and (iii) decreasing the total number of misclassified signals by over 8%. Moreover, when baseline defenses do not have perfect network information, we show that USD-FL achieves accuracies of approximately 74.1% and 62.5% in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings, outperforming existing server-driven baselines, which achieve 52.1% and 39.2% in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings, respectively.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Sleep Staging via Multi-Level Domain Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05363v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic sleep staging is essential for sleep assessment and disorder diagnosis. Most existing methods depend on one specific dataset and are limited to be generalized to other unseen datasets, for which the training data and testing data are from the same dataset. In this paper, we introduce domain generalization into automatic sleep staging and propose the task of generalizable sleep staging which aims to improve the model generalization ability to unseen datasets. Inspired by existing domain generalization methods, we adopt the feature alignment idea and propose a framework called SleepDG to solve it. Considering both of local salient features and sequential features are important for sleep staging, we propose a Multi-level Feature Alignment combining epoch-level and sequence-level feature alignment to learn domain-invariant feature representations. Specifically, we design an Epoch-level Feature Alignment to align the feature distribution of each single sleep epoch among different domains, and a Sequence-level Feature Alignment to minimize the discrepancy of sequential features among different domains. SleepDG is validated on five public datasets, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Variational Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication technology emerges as a pivotal bridge connecting AI with classical communication. The current semantic communication systems are generally modeled as an Auto-Encoder (AE). AE lacks a deep integration of AI principles with communication strategies due to its inability to effectively capture channel dynamics. This gap makes it difficult to justify the need for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) and to explain why performance improves. This paper begins by exploring lossless and lossy communication, highlighting that the inclusion of data distortion distinguishes semantic communication from classical communication. It breaks the conditions for the separation theorem to hold and explains why the amount of data transferred by semantic communication is less. Therefore, employing JSCC becomes imperative for achieving optimal semantic communication. Moreover, a Variational Source-Channel Coding (VSCC) method is proposed for constructing semantic communication systems based on data distortion theory, integrating variational inference and channel characteristics. Using a deep learning network, we develop a semantic communication system employing the VSCC method and demonstrate its capability for semantic transmission. We also establish semantic communication systems of equivalent complexity employing the AE method and the VAE method. Experimental results reveal that the VSCC model offers superior interpretability compared to AE model, as it clearly captures the semantic features of the transmitted data, represented as the variance of latent variables in our experiments. In addition, VSCC model exhibits superior semantic transmission capabilities compared to VAE model. At the same level of data distortion evaluated by PSNR, VSCC model exhibits stronger human interpretability, which can be partially assessed by SSIM.</description>

      <title>Linear Receive Beamforming for CAPA Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of linear receive beamforming in continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based uplink communications is analyzed. Three continuous beamforming techniques are proposed under the criteria of maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE). \romannumeral1) For \emph{MRC beamforming}, a closed-form expression for the beamformer is derived to maximize per-user signal power. The achieved uplink rate and mean-squared error (MSE) in detecting received data symbols are analyzed. \romannumeral2) For \emph{ZF beamforming}, a closed-form beamformer is derived based on channel correlation to eliminate interference. As a further advance, its optimality in maximizing effective channel gain while ensuring zero inter-user interference is proven. \romannumeral3) \emph{MMSE beamforming} is established as the optimal linear receive approach for CAPAs in terms of maximizing per-user rate and minimizing MSE. Closed-form expressions are derived for the MMSE beamformer and the achievable sum-rate and sum-MSE. It is mathematically proven that all proposed beamformers lie within the signal subspace spanned by users' spatial responses. Numerical results demonstrate that CAPAs outperform conventional spatially-discrete arrays (SPDAs) by achieving higher sum-rates and lower sum-MSEs under the proposed linear beamforming techniques.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Dispersive MIMO Channels with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: Modeling, Parametrization, and Receiver Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduced with the advent of statistical wireless channel models for high mobility communications and having a profound role in communication-centric (CC) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), the doubly-dispersive (DD) channel structure has long been heralded as a useful tool enabling the capture of the most important fading effects undergone by an arbitrary time-domain transmit signal propagating through some medium. However, the incorporation of this model into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system setups, relying on the recent paradigm-shifting transceiver architecture based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), in an environment with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) remains an open problem due to the many intricate details that have to be accounted for. In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel DD MIMO channel model that incorporates an arbitrary number of RISs in the ambient, as well as SIMs equipping both the transmitter and receiver. We then discuss how the proposed metasurfaces-parametrized DD (MPDD) channel model can be seamlessly applied to waveforms that are known to perform well in DD environments, namely, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), with each having their own inherent advantages and disadvantages. An illustrative application of the programmable functionality of the proposed model is finally presented to showcase its potential for boosting the performance of the aforementioned waveforms. Our numerical results indicate that the design of waveforms suitable to mitigating the effects of DD channels is significantly impacted by the emerging SIM technology.</description>

      <title>Uniform Resampling vs. Image Blur: Aliasing Approximation via Isotropic Gaussian Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key approximations to range simulation is downscaling the image, dictated by the natural trigonometric relationships that arise due to long-distance viewing. It is well-known that standard downsampling applied to an image without prior low-pass filtering leads to a type of signal distortion called \textit{aliasing}. In this study, we aim at modeling the distortion due to aliasing and show that a downsampled/upsampled image after an interpolation process can be very well approximated through the application of isotropic Gaussian low-pass filtering to the original image. In other words, the distortion due to aliasing can approximately be generated by low-pass filtering the image with a carefully determined cut-off frequency. We have found that the standard deviation of the isotropic Gaussian kernel $\sigma$ and the reduction factor $m$ (also called downsampling ratio) satisfy an approximate $m \approx 2 \sigma$ relationship. We provide both theoretical and practical arguments using two relatively small face datasets (Chicago DB, LRFID) as well as TinyImageNet to corroborate this empirically observed relationship.</description>

Abstract: We present SeizureFormer, a Transformer-based model for long-term seizure risk forecasting using interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) surrogate biomarkers and long episode (LE) biomarkers from responsive neurostimulation (RNS) systems. Unlike raw scalp EEG-based models, SeizureFormer leverages structured, clinically relevant features and integrates CNN-based patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks to model both short-term dynamics and long-term seizure cycles. Tested across five patients and multiple prediction windows (1 to 14 days), SeizureFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance with mean ROC AUC of 79.44 percent and mean PR AUC of 76.29 percent. Compared to statistical, machine learning, and deep learning baselines, it demonstrates enhanced generalizability and seizure risk forecasting performance under class imbalance. This work supports future clinical integration of interpretable and robust seizure forecasting tools for personalized epilepsy management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication systems suffer from mixed noise consisting of both non-Gaussian impulsive noise (IN) and white Gaussian noise (WGN) in many practical applications. However, there is little literature about the channel capacity under mixed noise. In this paper, we first investigate statistical properties of the mixed noise model and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the capacity-achieving input distribution under the $p$-th moment constraint. Then, we derive lower and upper capacity bounds with closed expressions. It is shown that the lower bounds can degenerate to the well-known Shannon formula under special scenarios. More importantly, we obtain the convergence of the lower and upper bound and therefore, the asymptotic and analytical capacity expression is obtained. In addition, the capacity for specific modulations and the corresponding lower bounds are discussed. Numerical results reveal that the capacity decreases as the impulsiveness of the mixed noise becomes dominant and the proposed capacity bounds are very tight.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents generalized Arlery-Tan-Rabaste-Levenshtein lower bounds on the maximum aperiodic ambiguity function (AF) magnitude of unimodular sequences under certain delay-Doppler low ambiguity zones (LAZ). Our core idea is to explore the upper and lower bounds on the Frobenius norm of the weighted auto- and cross-AF matrices by introducing two weight vectors associated with the delay and Doppler shifts, respectively. As a second major contribution, we demonstrate that our derived lower bounds are asymptotically achievable with selected Chu sequence sets by analyzing their maximum auto- and cross- AF magnitudes within certain LAZ.</description>

      <title>Is speckle noise more challenging to mitigate than additive noise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a function in the presence of both speckle and additive noises, commonly referred to as the de-speckling problem. Although additive noise has been thoroughly explored in nonparametric estimation, speckle noise, prevalent in applications such as synthetic aperture radar, ultrasound imaging, and digital holography, has not received as much attention. Consequently, there is a lack of theoretical investigations into the fundamental limits of mitigating the speckle noise.This paper is the first step in filling this gap.
  Our focus is on investigating the minimax estimation error for estimating a $\beta$-H\"older continuous function and determining the rate of the minimax risk. Specifically, if $n$ represents the number of data points, $f$ denotes the underlying function to be estimated, $\hat{\nu}_n$ is an estimate of $f$, and $\sigma_n$ is the standard deviation of the additive Gaussian noise, then $\inf_{\hat{\nu}_n} \sup_f \mathbb{E}_f\| \hat{\nu}_n - f \|^2_2$ decays at the rate $(\max(1,\sigma_n^4)/n)^{\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$. Note that the rate achieved under purely additive noise is $({\sigma_n^2/n})^{\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$. We will provide a detailed comparison of this rate with the one obtained in the presence of both noise types across different regimes of their relative magnitudes, and discuss the insights that emerge from these comparisons.</description>
