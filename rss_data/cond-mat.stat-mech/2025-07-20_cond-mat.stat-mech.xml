      <title>Information-Assisted Carnot Engine Surpasses Standard Thermodynamic Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information can improve heat engine performance, but the underlying principles are still not so clear. Here we introduce a Carnot information machine (CIE) and obtain a quantitative relationship between the engine performance and information. We demonstrate that the presence of information changes allows the CIE to operate as a heat engine in the regime where the standard Carnot cycle is prohibited, ensures that the efficiency of the CIE is greater than or equal to the standard Carnot efficiency, and significantly enables it to achieve 100\% efficiency with positive work extraction for arbitrary two-level systems. We explicitly demonstrate these features using a spin-1/2 system and propose an experimental implementation scheme based on a trapped $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster algorithms for Potts lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo algorithms, like the Swendsen-Wang and invaded-cluster, sample the Ising and Potts models asymptotically faster than single-spin Glauber dynamics do. Here, we generalize both algorithms to sample Potts lattice gauge theory by way of a $2$-dimensional cellular representation called the plaquette random-cluster model. The invaded-cluster algorithm targets Potts lattice gauge theory at criticality by implementing a stopping condition defined in terms of homological percolation, the emergence of spanning surfaces on the torus. Simulations for $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ lattice gauge theories on the cubical $4$-dimensional torus indicate that both generalized algorithms exhibit much faster autocorrelation decay than single-spin dynamics and allow for efficient sampling on $4$-dimensional tori of linear scale at least $40$.</description>

      <title>Linear response and exact hydrodynamic projections in Lindblad equations with decoupled Bogoliubov hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of spinless-fermion Lindblad equations that exhibit decoupled BBGKY hierarchies. In the cases where particle number is conserved, their late time behaviour is characterized by diffusive dynamics, leading to an infinite temperature steady state. Some of these models are Yang-Baxter integrable, others are not. The simple structure of the BBGKY hierarchy makes it possible to map the dynamics of Heisenberg-picture operators on few-body imaginary-time Schr\"odinger equations with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We use this formulation to obtain exact hydrodynamic projections of operators quadratic in fermions, and to determine linear response functions in Lindbladian non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning the non-Markovian features of subsystem dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.</description>

      <title>Learning mixed quantum states in large-scale experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and test a protocol to learn the matrix-product operator (MPO) representation of an experimentally prepared quantum state. The protocol takes as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements, and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum computation and simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Free Fermion Dynamics with Measurements: Topological Classification and Adaptive Preparation of Topological States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and (2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime \textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in \textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit protocol to coherent noise.</description>

      <title>Learning general pair interactions between self-propelled particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic active matter systems, such as active colloids, often have complex interactions, which can be of hydrodynamic, chemical or electrostatic origin and cannot be computed from first principles. Here, we use Stochastic Force Inference to learn general pair interactions, including transverse forces and torques, between self-propelled Janus particles from experimental trajectories. We use data from two experiments: one where the particles flock, and one where the system remains disordered. The learned interactions are then fed to numerical simulations, which reproduce all the experimental observables and could be extrapolated to different densities. Overall, we find that the radial interaction is mostly repulsive and isotropic, while the angular interaction has a richer angular dependence, which controls the behavior of the system; the transverse interaction is negligible. Finally, testing the symmetry relations obeyed by the inferred interactions allows us to show that they cannot come from electrostatics only, so that they must have a hydrodynamic component.</description>

      <title>Fast computational deep thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep thermalization refers to the emergence of Haar-like randomness from quantum systems upon partial measurements. As a generalization of quantum thermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement. Here, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest possible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit dynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth that are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally bounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies of the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the state -- this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum pseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms, these states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these properties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of computational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from structured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of from highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing these states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum computers. Our work also motivates the study of computational quantum pseudorandomness beyond BQP observers.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Study of Rayleigh-Plateau Instability at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the Rayleigh-Plateau instability at the interface between two immiscible liquids of equal viscosity using molecular dynamics simulations. We examined two types of initial conditions: one involving a single-mode perturbation at the interface and the other without any imposed perturbation. The growth rate under single-mode perturbation showed strong agreement with classical theory, particularly for large cylinder radii.However, for smaller radii, the growth rate deviated significantly from the theoretical prediction. This discrepancy can be attributed to the effects of thermal fluctuations or pressure differences between the inside and outside of a cylinder. In contrast, with initial conditions free of perturbation, we observed a relationship between breakup time and minimum radius, where the power exponent decreased as the radius decreased. This result suggests that thermal fluctuations have a more substantial impact on systems of smaller dimensions. This study demonstrated that imposing single-mode perturbations effectively suppresses thermal noise and mode coupling, thereby yielding growth rates consistent with those predicted by linear stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Modulated Poisson-Dirichlet diffusions arising from inclusion processes with a slow phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mean-field inclusion processes with an additional slow phase, in which particle interactions occur at a vanishing rate proportional to the inverse system size. In the thermodynamic limit, such systems exhibit condensation at high particle density, forming clusters of diverging size. Our main result provides convergence in law of inclusion processes to a novel two-component infinite-dimensional stochastic diffusion, describing the co-evolution of the solid condensed and microscopic fluid phase. In particular, we establish non-trivial mass exchange between the two phases.
  The resulting scaling limit extends the Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion (Ethier and Kurtz, 1981), introducing an additional control process that modulates its parameters. Our result builds on classical estimates of generator differences, which in this setting yield non-vanishing deterministic error bounds. We provide the missing probabilistic ingredient by showing instantaneous condensation, with particle clusters concentrating on a vanishing volume fraction immediately. We further establish the well-posedness of the limiting dynamics generally as Feller processes on a compact state space.</description>

      <title>Quantifying mixed-state entanglement via partial transpose and realignment moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science and many-body physics, yet quantifying it in mixed quantum many-body systems has remained a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we introduce families of quantitative entanglement witnesses, constructed from partial transpose and realignment moments, which provide rigorous bounds on entanglement monotones. Our witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell measurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware. Leveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement properties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics. We develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded entropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for pure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank using only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using four-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of quantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has been limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement phase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose negativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result that also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of entanglement in extensive many-body systems. Finally, we make progress on the entanglement required for quantum cryptography, establishing rigorous limits on pseudoentanglement and pseudorandom density matrices with bounded entropy. Our work opens new avenues for quantifying entanglement in large and noisy quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady states in multi-bath quantum collision models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the same thermal steady state for both settings as $\Delta t\to 0$, although even in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents. Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme. Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of non-Markovian interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact ground state on the 3D analogue of the Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact results in frustrated quantum many-body systems are rare, especially in dimensions higher than one. The Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model stands out as a rare example of a two-dimensional spin system with an exactly solvable dimer singlet ground state. In this work, we introduce a three-dimensional analogue of the SS lattice, constructed by deforming the pyrochlore lattice to preserve the local SS geometry. Despite the dimensional increase and altered topology, the ground-state phase diagrams of classical Ising and Heisenberg spins, remain analytically tractable and closely follow their 2D counterparts, including the existence of a 1/3 magnetization plateau and umbrella states. Most notably, for quantum spins S = 1/2, the dimer singlet state survives as an exact ground state over a finite region of the phase diagram. We argue, using exact diagonalization, that the singlet phase is stabilized beyond its 2D counterpart, suggesting enhanced robustness in three dimensions. These results offer a rare, controlled platform to explore the impact of dimensionality on quantum frustration, exact solvability, and potential spin liquid behavior in 3D, with relevance to emergent topological and magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the thermodynamic limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>

      <title>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</title>

Abstract: The notion of $deep$ $thermalisation$, where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles constrained only by conservation laws, represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical systems can display a plethora of ergodic and ergodicity breaking behaviors, ranging from simple periodicity to ergodicity and chaos. Here we report an unusual type of non-ergodic behavior in a many-body discrete-time dynamical system, specifically a multi-periodic response with multi-fractal distribution of equilibrium spectral weights at all rational frequencies. This phenomenon is observed in the momentum-conserving variant of the newly introduced class of the so-called parity check reversible cellular automata, which we define with respect to an arbitrary bi-partite lattice. Although the models display strong fragmentation of phase space of configurations, we demonstrate that the effect qualitatively persists within individual fragmented sectors, and even individual typical many-body trajectories. We provide detailed numerical analysis of examples on 2D (honeycomb, square) and 3D (cubic) lattices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Cost of Recurrent Erasure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of a time-varying external harmonic trap whereby the trap stiffness is changed from an initial to a final value in finite-time and then the system is reset when it relaxes to an equilibrium distribution in the final trap. Such setups are very similar to those studied in the context of the finite-time Landauer erasure principle. We analyze the thermodynamic costs of such a setup by deriving a moment generating function for the work cost of recurrently changing the trap stiffness in finite-time, thereby maintaining a non-equilibrium steady state. We analyze the mean and variance of the work required for a specific experimentally viable protocol and also obtain an optimal protocol which minimizes the mean cost. For both these procedures, our analysis captures both the large-time and short-time corrections. For the optimal protocol, we obtain a closed form expression for the mean cost for all protocol durations, thereby making contact with earlier work on geometric measures of dissipation-minimizing optimal protocols that implement information erasure.</description>

      <title>Universality in many-body driven systems with an umbilic point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stationary fluctuations of conserved slow modes in a two-lane model of hardcore particles which are expected to show universal behaviour. Specifically, we focus on the properties of fluctuations at a special umbilic point where the characteristic velocities coincide. At large space and time scales, fluctuations are described by a system of stochastic Burgers equations studied recently in [13]. Our data suggest coupling-dependent scaling functions and, even more surprisingly, coupling-dependent dynamical scaling exponents, distinct from KPZ scaling exponent typical for surface growth processes.</description>

      <title>Stationary-state dynamics of interacting phase oscillators in presence of noise and stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of global resetting on Kuramoto-type models of coupled limit-cycle oscillators with distributed frequencies both in absence and presence of noise. The dynamics comprises repeated interruption of the bare dynamics at random times with simultaneous resetting of phases of all the oscillators to a predefined state. To characterize the stationary-state behavior, we develop an analytical framework that spans across different generalizations of the Kuramoto model involving either quenched or annealed disorder or both, and for any choice of the natural frequency distribution. The framework applies to the dynamics both in absence and presence of resetting, and is employed to obtain in particular the stationary-state synchronization order parameter of the system, which is a measure of spontaneous ordering among the oscillator phases. A key finding is the pivotal role of correlations in shaping the ordering dynamics under resettling.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic uncertainty relation of a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal bound of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is modulated from that of the classical counterpart ($\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}=2$) when a quantumness is present in the dynamical process far from equilibrium. A recent study on a dissipative two-level system (TLS) subject to an external field indicates that quantum coherence can suppress the fluctuations of the irreversible current and loosens the TUR bound to $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$. Here, we extend on the field-driven single TLS % in a photonic bath to a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system (TQS), and explore how the quantum coupling between the two qubits, an additional complexity introduced to the probem of TLS, affects the photon current, fluctuations, and the TUR bound. We find that the TUR bound of TQS depends on the strength of coupling, such that $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}=\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$ when the two qubits are effectively decoupled under weak coupling, whereas another loose bound $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}\approx 1.36$ is identified for two strongly coupled qubits under strong fields. By contrasting the TQS against two coupled noisy oscillators, we illuminate the quantumness unique to the TQS and its effect on the TUR. Our findings from the study of TQS form the basis for understanding the TUR of more general $N$-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Chaos in Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nos\'e-Hoover Cell Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as $|T_x - T_y|$ increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transition for the homogeneous multi-component Curie-Weiss-Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogeneous multi-component Curie-Weiss-Potts model with $q \geq 3$ spins. The model is defined on the complete graph $K_{Nm}$, whose vertex set is equally partitioned into $m$ components of size $N$. For a configuration $\sigma: \{1, \cdots, Nm\} \to \{1, \cdots, q\},$ the Gibbs measure is defined by $$
  \mu_{N,\beta}(\sigma) =\frac{1}{Z_{N,\beta}} \exp\Big(\frac{\beta}{N} \sum_{v,w=1}^{Nm}\mathcal{J}(v,w)\, \mathbb{1}_{\{\sigma(v)=\sigma(w)\}}\Big), $$ where $Z_{N, \beta}$ is a normalizing constant, and $\beta&gt;0$ is the inverse temperature parameter. The interaction coefficients are $ \mathcal{J}(v, w) = \frac{J}{1 + (m-1) \lambda}$, for $v, w$ in the same component, and $\mathcal{J}(v, w) = \frac{J \lambda}{1 + (m-1)\lambda}$ for $v, w$ in the different components, where $\lambda \in (0, 1)$ is the relative strength of inter-component interaction to intra-component interaction, and $J&gt;0$ is the effective interaction strength. We identify a dynamical phase transition at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_{\operatorname{cr}} = \beta_{s}(q)/J$, where $\beta_{s}(q)$ is maximal inverse temperature guaranteeing a unique critical point of the free energy in the Curie-Weiss-Potts model arXiv:1204.4503. By extending the aggregate path method arXiv:1312.6728 to our multi-component setting, we prove $O(N \log N)$ mixing time in the high-temperature regime $\beta&lt;\beta_{s}(q)/J.$ In the low-temperature regime $\beta &gt; \beta_{s}(q)/J,$ we further show exponential mixing time by a metastability. This is the first result for the dynamical phase transition in the multi-component Potts model.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with integrable boundary fields. We find that the system exhibits two types of phases we refer to as $A$ and $B$ phases. In the $B$ type phase, the $\mathscr{PT}$- symmetry remains unbroken and it consists of eigenstates with only real energies, whereas the $A$ type phase contains a $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector comprised of eigenstates with only complex energies and a sector of unbroken $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry with eigenstates of real energies. The $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector consists of pairs of eigenstates whose energies are complex conjugates of each other. The existence of two sectors in the $A$ type phase is associated with the exponentially localized bound states at the edges with complex energies which are described by boundary strings. We find that both $A$ and $B$ type phases can be further divided into sub-phases which exhibit different ground states. We also compute the bound state wavefunction in one magnon sector and find that as the imaginary value of the boundary parameter is increased, the exponentially localized wavefunction broadens thereby protruding more into the bulk, which indicates that exponentially localized bound states may not be stabilized for large imaginary values of the boundary parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature anomalies in one-dimensional exactly solvable fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous experiments and numerical simulations have revealed that a limited number of two- and three-dimensional particle systems contract in volume upon heating isobarically. This anomalous phenomenon is known as negative thermal expansion (NTE). The present paper focuses on the possibility of NTE in exactly solvable one-dimensional fluids. Firstly, the quantization of classical pure hard rods (free of NTE) does not induce NTE which indicates an unimportant role of quantum mechanics in the topic. Secondly, the classical hard rods with various types of soft nearest-neighbor interactions that contain a basin of attraction with only one minimum are investigated. The ground-state analysis reveals that, for certain potentials, increasing the pressure can lead to a discontinuous jump in the mean spacing between particles. The low-temperature analysis of the exact equation of state indicates that the NTE anomaly is present if the curvature of the soft potential increases with the distance between particles or if the potential exhibits a singularity within the basin of attraction. Isotherms of the compressibility factor, which measures the deviation of the thermodynamic behavior of a real gas from that of an ideal gas, demonstrate typical plateau or double-plateau shapes in large intervals of particle density.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.</description>
