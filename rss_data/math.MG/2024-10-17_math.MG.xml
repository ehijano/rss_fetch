      <title>The Complex Illumination Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a complex analog of the celebrated Levi-Hadwiger-Boltyanski illumination (or covering) conjecture for complex convex bodies in C^n, as well as its (non-comparable) fractional version. A key element in posing these problems is computing the classical and fractional illumination numbers of the complex analog of the hypercube, i.e., the polydisc. We prove that the illumination number of the polydisc in C^n is equal to 2^(n+1)-1 and that the fractional illumination number of the polydisc in C^n is 2^n. In addition, we verify both conjectures for the classes of complex zonotopes and zonoids.</description>

      <title>Stability of Gr\"unbaum's Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a hyperplane $H$ cutting a bounded, convex body $K$ through its centroid, Gr\"unbaum's inequality states that
  $$|K\cap H^+|\geq \left(\frac{n}{n+1}\right)^n|K|$$ holds, where $H^+$ is a half-space of boundary $H$. The inequality is sharp, and equality is reached only if $K$ is a cone. We study the stability of Gr\"unbaum's inequality and show that bodies that are close to achieving the equality are geometrically close to being cones.</description>

      <title>Contractible Vietoris-Rips complexes of $\mathbb{Z}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new, short proof of a result of Virk, that the Vietoris-Rips complex of the group $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with the standard word metric is contractible at large enough scales. This is inspired by a key observation in Virk's proof, but we use Bestvina-Brady discrete Morse theory to get a very short proof with better bounds. In the course of this, we get a new, general criterion for a metric space to have contractible Vietoris-Rips complexes at large enough scales, which could prove useful in the future.</description>

      <title>Expected Sliced Transport Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal transport (OT) problem has gained significant traction in modern machine learning for its ability to: (1) provide versatile metrics, such as Wasserstein distances and their variants, and (2) determine optimal couplings between probability measures. To reduce the computational complexity of OT solvers, methods like entropic regularization and sliced optimal transport have been proposed. The sliced OT framework improves efficiency by comparing one-dimensional projections (slices) of high-dimensional distributions. However, despite their computational efficiency, sliced-Wasserstein approaches lack a transportation plan between the input measures, limiting their use in scenarios requiring explicit coupling. In this paper, we address two key questions: Can a transportation plan be constructed between two probability measures using the sliced transport framework? If so, can this plan be used to define a metric between the measures? We propose a "lifting" operation to extend one-dimensional optimal transport plans back to the original space of the measures. By computing the expectation of these lifted plans, we derive a new transportation plan, termed expected sliced transport (EST) plans. We prove that using the EST plan to weight the sum of the individual Euclidean costs for moving from one point to another results in a valid metric between the input discrete probability measures. We demonstrate the connection between our approach and the recently proposed min-SWGG, along with illustrative numerical examples that support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>An elliptic proof of the splitting theorems from Lorentzian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the splitting theorems from Lorentzian geometry, in which simplicity is gained by sacrificing linearity of the d'Alembertian to recover ellipticity. We exploit a negative homogeneity (non-uniformly) elliptic $p$-d'Alembert operator for this purpose. This allows us to bring the Eschenburg, Galloway, and Newman Lorentzian splitting theorems into a framework closer to the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>Klein-Arnold tensegrities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new classes of infinite and combinatorially periodic tensegrities, derived from algebraic multidimensional continued fractions in the sense of F. Klein. We describe the stress coefficients on edges through integer invariants of these continued fractions, as initiated by V.I. Arnold, thereby creating a novel connection between geometric rigidity theory and the geometry of continued fractions. Remarkably, the new classes of tensegrities possess rational self-stress coefficients. To establish the self-stressability of the frameworks, we present a projective version of the classical Maxwell-Cremona lifting principle, a result of independent interest.</description>
