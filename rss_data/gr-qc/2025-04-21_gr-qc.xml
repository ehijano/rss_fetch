      <title>Einstein's perihelion formula and its generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's perihelion advance formula can be given a geometric interpretation in terms of the curvature of the ellipse. The formula can be obtained by splitting the constant term of an auxiliary polar equation for an elliptical orbit into two parts that, when combined, lead to the expression of this relativistic effect. Using this idea, we develop a general method for dealing with orbital precession in the presence of central perturbing forces, and apply the method to the determination of the total (relativistic plus Newtonian) secular perihelion advance of the planet Mercury.</description>

      <title>The first-order orbital equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the first-order orbital equation employing a complex variable formalism. We then examine Newton's theorem on precessing orbits and apply it to the perihelion shift of an elliptic orbit in general relativity. It is found that corrections to the inverse-square gravitational force law formally similar to that required by general relativity were suggested by Clairaut in the 18th century.</description>

      <title>The Schott term in the binding energy for compact binaries on circular orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phasing for compact binary systems on circular orbits was obtained in arXiv:2304.11185 at fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order thanks to two main ingredients: the 4PN conservative energy (associated to a nonradiative spacetime) in terms of the orbital frequency and the 4.5PN flux in terms of the waveform frequency (i.e., the half-frequency of the $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode). When obtaining the phasing, a key physical postulate was made: the expression of the binding energy in terms of the waveform frequency was assumed to be identical to the expression of the conservative energy in terms of the orbital frequency. This postulate was necessary to ensure that the frequency evolution obtained through the flux-balance law (which involves the binding energy) was independent of the choice of spacetime foliation. In this work, I show that the binding energy entering the flux-balance law differs from the 4PN conservative energy by a 4PN pseudo-Schott term, associated with radiation-reaction effects due to gravitational tails. Unlike the usual Schott terms (at 2.5PN, 3.5PN and 4.5PN), the pseudo-Schott term is not a total derivative and is in fact hereditary, so it does not vanish for circular orbits. Remarkably, the binding energy thus obtained is in perfect agreement with the one obtained using the aforementioned physical postulate, which confirms that the 4.5PN phasing associated to the waveform frequency computed in arXiv:2304.11185 is indeed correct. This result is extended to the other Poincar\'e invariants, and `thermodynamic' relations between the binding energy and angular momentum are established. Finally, the chirp and phasing associated to the orbital frequency are presented at 4.5PN, including horizon-absorption effects.</description>

      <title>The radial metric function does not identify null surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which a hypersurface becomes null through the use of coordinate transformations. We demonstrate that, in static spacetimes, the correct criterion for a surface to be null is~$g_{tt} = 0$, rather than~$g^{rr} = 0$, in agreement with the results of Vollick. We further show that, if a Kruskal-like coordinate exists, the proxy condition~$g^{rr} = 0$ is equivalent to~$g_{tt} = 0$ if~$\partial_r g_{tt} \neq 0$ and both~$g^{rr}$ and~$g_{tt}$ vanish at the same rate near the horizon. Our method extends naturally to axisymmetric stationary spacetimes, for which we demonstrate that the condition~$\det\big(h_{ab}\big) = 0$ for the induced metric on a null hypersurface is recovered. By contrast with the induced metric approach, our method provides a physical perspective that connects the general null condition with its underlying relationship to photon geodesics.</description>

      <title>Regge poles, grey body factors, and absorption cross sections for black hole metrics with discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently proposed by Rosato {\it et al.} and Oshita {\it et al.} that black hole greybody factors, as stable observables at relatively high frequencies, are more relevant quantities than quasinormal modes in modeling ringdown spectral amplitudes. It was argued that the overall contributions of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes conspire to produce stable observables through collective interference effects. In this regard, the present study investigates the Regge poles, the underlying quantities of the greybody factor governed by the singularities in the complex angular momentum plane, for perturbed black hole metrics. To this end, we generalize the matrix method to evaluate the Regge poles in black hole metrics with discontinuities. To verify our approach, the numerical results are compared with those obtained using a modified version of the continued fraction method. The obtained Regge pole spectrum is then used to calculate the scattering amplitude and cross-section. We show that the stability of these observables at moderate frequencies can be readily interpreted in terms of the stability of the Regge pole spectrum, particularly the low-lying modes. Nonetheless, destabilization still occurs at higher frequencies, characterized by the emergence of a bifurcation in the spectrum. The latter further evolves, leading to more significant deformation in the Regge poles, triggered by ultraviolet metric perturbations moving further away from the black hole. However, based on the validity of the WKB approximation, it is argued that such an instability in the spectrum is not expected to cause significant observable implications.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Thermodynamic Properties of Frolov Black Holes with Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated a modified Frolov black hole (BH) model that incorporates both a global monopole (GM) and a cosmic string (CS) to explore the interplay between non-singular BH regularization and topological defect effects. In our study, we derived a spacetime metric characterized by a regulated core through a length scale parameter $\alpha$ and introduced additional modifications via the GM parameter $\eta$ and the CS parameter $a$, which collectively alter the horizon structure and causal geometry of the BH. We analyzed the thermodynamic properties by deriving expressions for the mass function, Hawking temperature, and entropy, and found that the inclusion of GM and CS significantly deviates the BH entropy from the conventional Bekenstein-Hawking area law, while numerical investigations showed that the shadow radius exhibits contrasting behaviors: the Frolov parameters tend to reduce the shadow size whereas the topological defects enhance it. Furthermore, we examined the dynamics of scalar and electromagnetic perturbations by solving the massless Klein-Gordon equation in the BH background and computed the quasinormal modes (QNMs) using the WKB approximation, which confirmed the BH's stability and revealed that the oscillation frequencies and damping rates are strongly dependent on the parameters $\alpha$, $q$, $\eta$, and $a$. Our results suggest that the distinct observational signatures arising from this composite BH model may provide a promising avenue for testing modified gravity theories in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and gravitational radiation of binaries with spin precession and eccentricity in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing parity symmetry constitutes a critical aspect in gravitational physics. As a representative parity-violating theory, dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity has attracted significant attention in recent gravitational wave (GW) studies. Numerous works have constrained the dCS theory through GW observations using quasi-circular waveform templates. Since GW parameter estimation depends critically on waveform template accuracy, improved source modeling and waveform construction are essential for tighter constraints on parity-violating gravity. This work explores the dynamics and gravitational radiation from the binary black hole systems with orbital eccentricity and spin precession. By extending the quasi-Keplerian parameterization, we solve the equations of motion including leading-order dCS corrections and precession effects. Furthermore, the conservative sectors of the gravitational and scalar radiation are presented, the corresponding energy and angular momentum loss are calculated, and the orbital decay is also investigated. Notably, because of the non-zero monopole scalar radiation, carrying energy but not angular momentum, the zero-eccentricity orbit is no longer the final stable state of binaries under radiation reaction. This work provides the theoretical foundation for the complete waveform construction in dCS gravity, benefiting the future gravitational parity-symmetry tests.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Geodesics in Non-linear Electrodynamics Corrected Black Hole and Shadows of its Rotating Analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13466v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate photon geodesics in a static black hole spacetime sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED)--a model inspired by the confinement of heavy quark-antiquark pairs that recovers Maxwell's theory in the strong-field limit. This solution generalizes the Schwarzschild metric by introducing both an electric charge $Q$ and a nonlinear parameter $\zeta$. Employing a backward ray-tracing scheme, we integrate the null geodesic equations to characterize critical orbits and deflection angles in the NLED background. To explore rotational effects, we then generate the spinning analogue via the Newman-Janis algorithm, and analyze its resulting ergosphere and shadow profile.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Keplerian parametrization for compact binaries on hyperbolic orbits in scalar-tensor theories at second post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the generalized quasi-Keplerian parametrization for compact binaries on quasihyperbolic orbits at second post-Newtonian (2PN) order in a class of massless scalar-tensor theories, extending the analogous results for quasielliptic systems [arXiv:2401:06844]. In particular, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impact parameter at 2PN. We explicitly confirm the 2PN conservative scatter-to-bound map in these theories between the scattering angle and the periastron advance. We then compute the total energy and angular momentum lost by the system. Flux-balance arguments then allow us to compute the dissipative contributions to the scattering angle at 1.5PN and 2.5PN, completing the full scattering angle at 2.5PN in these theories. Finally, we obtain, in general relativity, an expression for the 3PN impact parameter in the conservative sector, correcting previous literature.</description>

      <title>How Accidental was Inflation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are discriminating between different models of inflation, disfavoring simple monomial potentials whilst being consistent with models whose predictions resemble those of the Starobinsky $R + R^2$ cosmological model. However, this model may suffer from theoretical problems, since it requires a large initial field value, threatening the validity of the effective field theory. This is quantified by the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which predicts the appearance of a tower of light states associated with an effective ultra-violet cutoff. This could be lower than the inflation scale for cases with an extended period of inflation, leading to an additional problem of initial conditions. No-scale supergravity models can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model and accommodate the CMB data at the expense of fine-tuning of parameters at the level of $10^{-5}$. Here, we propose a solution to this problem based on an explicit realisation of the Starobinsky model in string theory, where this `deformation' parameter is calculable and takes a value of order of the one corresponding to the Starobinsky inflaton potential. Within this range, there are parameter values that accommodate more easily the combination of Planck, ACT and DESI BAO data, while also restricting the range of possible inflaton field values, thereby avoiding the swampland problem and predicting that the initial conditions for inflation compatible with the CMB data are generic.</description>

      <title>Light Scalar Fields Foster Production of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields are ubiquitous in theories of high-energy physics. In the context of cosmic inflation, this suggests the existence of spectator fields, which provide a subdominant source of energy density. We show that spectator fields boost the inflationary production of primordial black holes, with single-field ultra-slow roll evolution supplanted by a phase of evolution along the spectator direction, and primordial perturbations amplified by the resulting multifield dynamics. This generic mechanism is largely free from the severe fine-tuning that afflicts single-field inflationary PBH models.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Dark Matter from the String Theory Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose heavy axions as a natural superheavy dark matter candidate in string theory, with the relic density of dark matter originating in quantum fluctuations during cosmic inflation. String Theory is well known for the possibility of having tens to hundreds of axion-like particles -- the axiverse. Moduli stabilization generates high-scale masses for many of these, placing them naturally in the superheavy regime of particle physics. We consider moduli stabilization in the KKLT framework, featuring a single volume modulus and $C_4$ axion, and a fiducial inflation model minimally coupled to the volume modulus. We demonstrate that both the volume modulus and the axion can be abundantly produced through gravitational particle production. The former is unstable and readily decays to Standard Model particles while the latter (the axion) can be stable and survives to constitute the present day dark matter.</description>

      <title>A species scale-driven breakdown of effective field theory in time-dependent string backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way in which effective field theory (EFT) can break down in cosmological string backgrounds depending on the behavior of the quantum gravity cutoff in infinite distance limits, known as the species scale $\Lambda_s$. Namely, EFT can break down if the species scale $\Lambda_s$ falls off so rapidly as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) scale factor grows from some initial value $a_i$ to some final value $a_f$ that the physical momentum of an initial Hubble-sized perturbation $\sim H_i^{-1}$ grows to exceed the species scale. For EFT to remain valid, a new condition $H_i \frac{a_i}{a_f} \ll \Lambda_{s,f}$ must hold, which is distinct from Trans-Planckian conditions discussed in the literature. Using the universal relation $\frac{\nabla m}{m} \cdot \frac{\nabla \Lambda_s}{\Lambda_s} = \frac{1}{d-2}$ in the infinite distance limits of moduli space where $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest tower and $\nabla$ measures variations with respect to the canonical metric on moduli space, we show that spatially flat FRW solutions in the string landscape violate this condition or at best marginally satisfy it. However, we find that sufficiently large negative spatial curvature always avoids a breakdown. To avoid EFT breakdown, we derive an upper bound on the duration of quasi-de Sitter expansion that classically evolves to decelerated expansion. Our bound is proportional to the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) bound, with the advantage that it applies to any FRW solution in the string landscape. Finally, we distinguish EFT breakdown from TCC violation, the latter being a quantum gravity constraint rather than an EFT limitation. Perhaps our most surprising finding is that in any flat FRW solution that develops a weakly coupled string at future infinity the EFT inevitably breaks down.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the Absolute Magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, one of the well-known serious challenges in cosmology is the Hubble tension, namely the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, we are interested in alleviating the Hubble tension with a local void. The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. In the literature, it was found that a local void cannot satisfyingly alleviate the Hubble tension, since it is not preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model by the observations such as the Pantheon SNIa sample, especially in terms of the information criteria AIC and BIC. In the present work, we try to alleviate the Hubble tension with a local void and transitions of the absolute magnitude $M$, by using the Pantheon+ SNIa sample alone or jointly with the CMB data of Planck 2018. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.</description>

Abstract: We elaborate on a string world-sheet connection to flat space-time holography. More specifically, in the high energy (zero tension) limit of tree-level string scattering in flat backgrounds the underlying string world-sheets can be related to the celestial sphere, with the saddle points of the high energy string description representing points on the celestial sphere. We show that this picture continues to hold at all subleading orders in the quantum fluctuations around this classical configuration. As a consequence there is a dual description of the high energy limit of string theory as the large energy expansion on the celestial sphere organized by (light) higher spin modes. This approach points to an intrinsic construction of celestial conformal field theory (CFT) by relating it to a (free) world-sheet CFT of string theory. We also elaborate on the high energy representations of tree-level open and closed string amplitudes and work out their subleading corrections. Their number theoretic properties and relevance as amplitudes of tensionless strings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Keplerian parametrization for eccentric compact binaries in scalar-tensor theories at second post-Newtonian order and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06844v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized post-Keplerian parametrization for compact binaries on eccentric bound orbits is established at second post-Newtonian (2PN) order in a class of massless scalar-tensor theories. This result is used to compute the orbit-averaged flux of energy and angular momentum at Newtonian order, which means relative 1PN order beyond the leading-order dipolar radiation of scalar-tensor theories. The secular evolution of the orbital elements is then computed at 1PN order. At leading order, the closed form "Peters and Mathews" relation between the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$ is found to be independent of any scalar-tensor parameter, and is given by $a \propto e^{4/3}/(1-e^2)$. Finally, the waveform is obtained at Newtonian order in the form of a spherical harmonic mode decomposition, extending to eccentric orbits the results obtained in arXiv:2201.10924.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Vanishing Nonlinear Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers parametrize the conservative induced tidal response of self-gravitating objects. It is well established that asymptotically-flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity have vanishing Love numbers. In linear perturbation theory, this result was shown to be a consequence of ladder symmetries acting on black hole perturbations. In this work, we show that a black hole's tidal response induced by a static, parity-even tidal field vanishes for all multipoles to all orders in perturbation theory. Our strategy is to focus on static and axisymmetric spacetimes for which the dimensional reduction to the fully nonlinear Weyl solution is well-known. We define the nonlinear Love numbers using the point-particle effective field theory, matching with the Weyl solution to show that an infinite subset of the static, parity-even Love number couplings vanish, to all orders in perturbation theory. This conclusion holds even if the tidal field deviates from axisymmetry. Lastly, we discuss the symmetries underlying the vanishing of the nonlinear Love numbers. An $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ algebra acting on a covariantly-defined potential furnishes ladder symmetries analogous to those in linear theory. This is because the dynamics of the potential are isomorphic to those of a static, massless scalar on a Schwarzschild background. We comment on the connection between the ladder symmetries and the Geroch group that is well-known to arise from dimensional reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the background and perturbations in $k$-essence inflation models and show that a general $k$-essence exhibits a simple scaling property. In particular, we study two classes of $k$-inflation models with the potential characterized by an inflection point. We demonstrate that these models enjoy scaling properties that could be used to redefine input parameters so that the perturbation spectra satisfy correct normalization at the CMB pivot scale. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate gravitational lensing within the space-time framework of traversable wormholes, focusing on the combined effects of a global monopole and a cosmic string. Specifically, we examine the Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormhole metric and analyze how these topological defects influence photon trajectories. By considering the weak-field limit, we derive analytical expressions for the photon deflection angle, highlighting how factors such as the wormhole throat radius, the global monopole charge, and the cosmic string influence the gravitational lensing phenomenon. We also examine the weak-field limit of lensing phenomena for a zero wormhole throat radius and derive an analytical expression for the deflection angle of photon light in this scenario.</description>

      <title>A Directive for Obtaining Algebraically General Solutions of Einstein Equations Based on the Canonical Killing Tensor Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work serves as a sequel to our previous study, where, by assuming the existence of canonical Killing tensor forms and applying a general null tetrad transformation, we obtained a variety of solutions (Petrov types D, III, N) in vacuum with cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Among these, there is a unique Petrov type D solution with a shear-free, diverging, and non-geodesic null congruence that admits the $K^2_{\mu \nu}$ canonical form, which we present in full detail. Additionally, we introduce a Petrov type I solution with a shear-free, diverging, and non-geodesic null congruence, obtained by starting from the same canonical form and employing Lorentz transformations within the concept of symmetric null tetrads, instead of a general null tetrad transformation. Building on this and following the concept of symmetric null tetrads, we propose a new directive. This suggests that, by assuming the canonical forms of the Killing tensor and employing Lorentz transformations that correlate the spin coefficients among themselves, such as $\pi=-\bar{\tau}$ and $\kappa = -\bar{\nu}$, one can obtain a broader class of algebraically general solutions to Einstein's equations, rather than relying solely on boosts and spatial rotations.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Carroll Galileons in Three Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first example of an interacting Carroll supersymmetric field theory with both temporal and spatial derivatives, belonging to the Galileon class, where the non-linear field equation remains second-order in derivative. To achieve this, we introduce two novel tools. First, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional Galilei/Carroll duality can be extended to higher dimensions, and includes the supersymmetry, by expressing the generators in a spinor basis. We then show that Carroll superalgebras are naturally connected to Euclidean, rather than Poincar\'e, superalgebras. Using the real multiplet of the three-dimensional N $=1$ Euclidean supersymmetry, we construct the scalar multiplet for N $=2$ Carroll supersymmetry and develop a tensor calculus to realize the aforementioned model. These results offer new insights into the structure of genuine higher-dimensional Carroll field theories and Carroll supersymmetry. While these tools are utilized to build a specific model, we anticipate that they possess broader applications in Carrollian physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cross-section of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore how to detect the large quantum fluctuations in the throat of a near-extremal black hole, where the dynamics are governed by the Schwarzian theory. To this end, we scatter a low-frequency wave of a massless, minimal scalar off the black hole and calculate the absorption cross-section. In the semiclassical regime, where the Schwarzian is weakly coupled, we recover the universal result that the cross-section equals the horizon area. However, in the strongly coupled regime, where quantum fluctuations dominate, we find that the absorption cross-section exceeds the semiclassical prediction. This result may seem counterintuitive, given that the density of black hole states is suppressed in this regime. Nevertheless, two effects outweigh this suppression. First, quantum fluctuations enhance absorption transitions between individual states, with the effect becoming stronger closer to the ground state. Second, these fluctuations significantly reduce stimulated emission. We conclude that a measurement showing an enhanced absorption cross-section serves as a clear signature of the large quantum fluctuations in the geometry.</description>

Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality of gravitational radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the continuous quantum measurement of gravitational radiation. This is typically done by coupling the radiation to a meter, such as a resonant mass detector or an interferometer, which is subsequently read out by a detector. We find that the detector employed determines whether the gravitational field exhibits wave or particle characteristics. A linear detector, such as a homodyne detector, yields no signal for a field in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude of a field in a coherent state. Such a linear detector thus supports a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton, resulting in a quantum jump in energy equal to the energy of the absorbed graviton. Our results extend the principle of complementarity to quantized gravitational radiation, demonstrating the detector dependence of the graviton, and indicates that conceptually simple modifications to gravitational-wave detectors can make them graviton counters.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity of Tensor Induced Density Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussianity of second-order matter density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (GWs). These tensor-induced scalar modes arise from local fluctuations in the GWs energy density, which is quadratic in tensor perturbations. The resulting second-order density contrast follows a chi-squared distribution, naturally exhibiting significant non-Gaussianity. We compute the bispectrum of these tensor-induced scalar modes and analyze its dependence on various primordial GWs power spectra, including scale-invariant, blue-tilted, Gaussian-bump, and monochromatic sources. We find that the bispectrum shape is inherently sensitive to the underlying GWs spectrum by construction. In particular, Gaussian-bump and monochromatic sources produce a strong signal peaking in the equilateral configuration, similar to the effect of scalar-induced tensor modes. Our findings reveal a new way to probe primordial GWs via galaxy surveys and highlight a unique feature of tensor-induced density perturbations, otherwise mimicking linear ones on sub-horizon scales.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Meets DESI: Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration since in this case any trans-Planckian quantum fluctuation would eventually stretch beyond the Hubble radius, breaking the applicability of any effective field theory and cosmological techniques. By combining DESI DR2 data with the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and LOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also we examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them, a result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on General Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply that viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from a curvaton: the role of bimodal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes in curvaton models of inflation, where the curvature perturbation is not only generated by the inflaton but also by a light scalar field (the curvaton) that decays after inflation. During inflation, both fields are subject to quantum diffusion, owing to small-scale vacuum fluctuations crossing out the Hubble radius. After inflation, whether the curvaton dominates the universe or not depends on its field value when inflation ends. Since that value is stochastic, different regions of the universe undergo different post-inflationary histories. In practice, we show that this results in a double-peaked distribution for the number of e-folds realised in these models. Since that number of e-folds is related to the curvature perturbation by the delta-N formalism, the presence of a second peak has important consequences for primordial black holes that we discuss.</description>
