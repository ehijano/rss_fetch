      <title>Temporally-multiplexed dual-frequency terahertz imaging at kilohertz frame rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a temporally-multiplexed dual-colour terahertz (THz) imaging technique using THz-to-optical conversion in atomic vapour. By rapidly alternating the pump laser frequency, we sequentially excite two atomic states, each absorbing a different THz frequency: 0.5 THz and 1.1 THz. Each THz field induces optical fluorescence at a distinct wavelength, enabling the creation of a sequence of alternating, interleaved images for each frequency. Synchronizing the laser switching with camera acquisition allows video capture at 1,000 frames per second for both frequencies. The system's speed is limited only by laser power and fibre switching hardware. The presented method can be scaled to image more THz frequencies through the addition of further laser frequencies, paving the way for THz hyperspectral imaging in many real-world settings.</description>

      <title>A magneto-optical trap of silver and potassium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dual magneto-optical trap of $^{109}$Ag and $^{39}$K. For silver, a decreasing-field Zeeman slower loads a MOT of $1.5{\times}10^8$ atoms at a temperature of 0.74(5) mK, with laser cooling occurring primarily on the $D_2$ line of $4d^{10}5s\; {}^2S_{1/2}\rightarrow 5p\; {}^2P_{3/2}$ at 328 nm. We create a novel Ag "dark spot MOT," where shelving the atoms in a dark state enhances the captured atom number by a factor of two and the lifetime by a factor of four. For potassium, we obtain $2{\times}10^8$ trapped atoms, and further cooling on the $D_1$ transition via grey molasses results in a cloud of $1.2{\times} 10^8$ atoms at 7(1) $\mu$K. We observe evidence of photoionization loss of the K MOT in the presence of Ag laser-cooling light, with implications for optimal dual species loading strategies. Our results on Ag point to simple and general laser cooling strategies for other coinage metals (Au, Cu). Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for the production of alkali-coinage metal degenerate quantum mixtures and highly polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Microwave spectroscopy and multi-channel quantum defect analysis of ytterbium Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex Rydberg structure of ytterbium atoms is shaped by multiple low-lying ion-core-excited states and strong channel interactions, which presents both opportunities and challenges for quantum information processing and precision metrology. In this work, we extend high-resolution microwave spectroscopy and multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) modeling of singly excited $6sn\ell$ Rydberg states in $^{174}$Yb and $^{171}$Yb to include the $\ell = 3$ ($f$) and $\ell = 4$ ($g$) series. Our measurements reveal $p$-$f$ mixing in odd-parity Rydberg states of $^{171}$Yb, which we incorporate by combined MQDT models for $6snp$ and $6snf$ series. Additionally, we observe that for $\ell = 4$ the spin-orbit interaction dominates over the exchange interaction, such that the $6sng$ states are more accurately described in a $jj$-coupled basis. We validate our models by comparing the predicted Land\'e $g$-factors and static dipole polarizabilities with experimental measurements, finding excellent agreement. These results provide important input for designing high-fidelity entangling gates with ytterbium atoms.</description>

      <title>Optimizing loading of cold cesium atoms into a hollow-core fiber using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental multi-parameter optimization can enhance the interfacing of cold atoms with waveguides and cavities.
  Recent implementations of machine learning (ML) algorithms demonstrate the optimization of complex cold atom ex perimental sequences in a multi-dimensional parameter space. Here, we report on the use of ML to optimize loading
  of cold atoms into a hollow-core fiber. We use Gaussian process machine learning in M-LOOP, an open-source online
  machine learning interface, to perform this optimization. This is implemented by iteratively adjusting experimental
  parameters based on feedback from an atom-counting measurement of optical "bleaching". We test the effectiveness
  of ML, alongside a manual scan, to converge to optimal loading conditions. We survey multiple ML runs to auto matically access appreciable atom-loading conditions. In conjunction with experimental design choices, ML-assisted
  optimization holds promise in the implementation and maintenance of complex cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Data-insenstive cooling of polar molecules with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to sympathetically cool polar molecules with Rydberg atoms without destroying the quantum information encoded in the polar molecules. While the interactions between the two are usually state-dependent, we show how to engineer state-insensitive interactions between the hot molecules and the cold atoms with a suitable choice of internal states and the application of external fields. The resulting interactions, which may be van der Waals or dipolar, induce a phonon swap interaction between the two species, thereby coherently cooling the polar molecules without affecting the internal state, a process which can be repeated if the atoms are cooled again or new cold atoms are brought in. Our cooling schemes open the possibility of extending quantum computation and simulation times in emerging hybrid tweezer arrays of polar molecules and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Neutrino Background through Parametric Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that relic neutrinos from the Big Bang may induce the parametric fluorescence in molecular systems, which offers a novel way to discover cosmic neutrino background. By coherently scattering with molecular energy levels, a massive neutrino can spontaneously ``decay" into a lighter neutrino and an infrared signal photon, i.e., $\nu^{}_{i} + M \to \nu^{}_{j} + \gamma^{}_{\rm S} + M$, where the molecular state $M$ remains unchanged after the scattering. Because the amplitudes of different radiants are matched in phase, the rate is coherently enhanced and proportional to the squared density of ambient dipoles. When the energy transfer from neutrinos coincides with the molecular energy-level difference, the fluorescence will be on resonance. We find that the event rate for $\nu^{}_{i} \to \nu^{}_{j} + \gamma^{}_{\rm S}$ at the resonance peak through the magnetic dipole transition can reach $R \sim 5~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ (or $10~{\rm yr}^{-1}$) for Dirac (or Majorana) neutrinos for a nominal target with a spatial dimension of $l=3~{\rm m}$. Parity mixing by the Stark effect may help to further magnify the signal rate.</description>

      <title>Measured Lepton Magnetic Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron and muon magnetic moment have played, and continue to play, important roles in testing the fundamental mathematical description of physical reality called the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). The electron magnetic moment is the most precisely measured property of an elementary particle and the most precise SM prediction, setting up the most precise confrontation ever between experiment and theory. It enables the most precise test of quantum field theory, and of the fundamental CPT symmetry invariance of the SM with leptons. The stable electron is studied with quantum methods while the electron remains for months in its quantum ground and first excited states. The muon magnetic moment is one of the most precisely measured property of an unstable elementary particle. Although less precise measured than the electron, it provides greater sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model -- a powerful tool for testing the existence of new particles and forces. Because muons decay quickly, they must be studied as they orbit at nearly the speed of light in a large storage ring. The extremely high precision of the electron and muon magnetic moment measurements has driven major advances in theoretical physics, inspiring new techniques in quantum field theory, precision calculations, and lattice gauge theory. Only experimental limits currently exist on the size of the magnetic moments of the tau and neutrino leptons.</description>

      <title>Photoemission Chronoscopy of the Iodoalkanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delays in photoemission are on the order of attoseconds and have been experimentally determined in atoms, molecules and solids. Their magnitude and energy dependence are expected to yield fundamental insights into the properties of the systems in which they're measured. In a recent study Biswas \textsl{et al.} (Biswas, S., F\"org, B., Ortmann, L. et al. Probing molecular environment through photoemission delays. Nat. Phys. 16, 778-783 (2020)) determined the absolute photoemission time of the I$4d$ level in iodoethane via attosecond streaking spectroscopy, finding the presence of a functional group to increase the photoemission time delay, suggesting a correlation between the size of the functional group and time delay based on a semi-classical calculation. Here we experimentally study the dependence of the I$4d$ photoemission time on the functional group in the iodoalkanes from iodomethane up to 2-iodobutane at three photon energies across the giant resonance in the I$4d\to\varepsilon f$ photoemission channel, finding that the presence alone of a functional group does not necessarily increase the photoemission delay, and that overall no clear correlation between its size and the photoemission time delay can be established.</description>

      <title>Positronium formation and threshold behavior in positron-sodium collisions at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the elastic and inelastic scattering of positrons by sodium atoms in both the ground state, Na($3s$), and excited states, Na*($3p$, $4s$, $3d$), using the hyperspherical coordinate method with a model potential to represent the atomic core. The threshold behavior of positronium (Ps) formation cross sections is analyzed as the positron impact energy $E$ approaches zero. Within this framework, we derive a generalized expression for partial-wave Ps-formation cross sections at low positron energies, which applies to both ground-state and excited-state sodium targets. Our results confirm that the total threshold behavior follows the expected power-law dependence: \( \sigma_{\text{Ps}} \propto E^{-1/2} \) for exothermic reactions and \( \sigma_{\text{Ps}} \propto E^{a} \) for endothermic reactions, where \( a &gt; 0 \). Furthermore, we find that Ps-formation cross sections for positron scattering from excited Na states are significantly larger than those from the ground state in the low-energy region. A notable enhancement of Gailitis-Damburg oscillations is observed above the Ps($n=2$) threshold, which may account for the increase observed in experimental data. Incorporating contributions from excited sodium targets improves agreement with experimental results and may help resolve discrepancies between theoretical predictions and measurements.</description>

      <title>High-Stability Single-Ion Clock with $5.5\times10^{-19}$ Systematic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical atomic clock with fractional frequency uncertainty of $5.5\times10^{-19}$ and fractional frequency stability of $3.5 \times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of a single $^{27}$Al$^+$ ion. A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$ $^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s, enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.</description>
