      <title>Assessing engineering wake models against operational data: insights from the Lillgrund wind farm wake steering campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validating engineering wake models under real-world operational conditions is essential for improving wind farm performance predictions. This study uses a unique dataset from the Lillgrund offshore wind farm collected during the Horizon 2020 TotalControl project, combining synchronous SCADA and LiDAR measurements under baseline operation (no intentional yaw offset) and active wake steering. Four analytical wake model combinations are assessed, employing different formulations for velocity deficit, added turbulence, wake superposition, and deflection, implemented in the LongSim software developed by DNV. The analysis focuses on time-averaged wake velocity deficits and turbine- and farm-level power output, with model accuracy quantified using mean absolute error metrics. The models reproduce general wake deficit trends and wake deflection across a range of atmospheric conditions, with normalised velocity deficit errors between 7% and 15%. Power prediction errors increase with farm depth, with turbine-level errors between 3% and 23% and farm-level errors between -13% and +30%. Some analytical models achieve accuracy comparable to reported LES results while requiring substantially lower computational cost. The results highlight the value of field campaigns for benchmarking engineering wake models and inform trade-offs between model fidelity and operational practicality for wake steering applications.</description>

      <title>Reviving the Suspension Balance Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Suspension Balance Model (SBM) [J. Fluid Mech. \textbf{275}, 157 (1994)] for two-phase flows uses the momentum balance of the particle phase as a closure for the particle flux, showing that particle migration is driven by the divergence of the particle-phase stress. The underlying basis of this model was challenged by Nott~et~al.\ [Phys. Fluids \textbf{23}, 043304 (2011)] where the authors argued that the hydrodynamic contributions to the suspension stress should not appear in the particle-phase momentum balance, being replaced by a different particle-phase stress. The particle-phase stress proposed by Nott~et~al., while mathematically correct, involves the partitioning of the (non-pairwise-additive) hydrodynamic forces, and care is needed to understand how the force on a chosen particle is affected by a second particle. We show by a simple two-particle calculation what is the proper partitioning, and show that it is consistent thermodynamically and gives the correct equilibrium osmotic pressure of Brownian colloids. Using Stokesian Dyanmics suspension rheology, we quantitatively demonstrate that the hydrodynamic contribution to the suspension stress is virtually identical to particle-phase stress; the only difference is that the isolated single-particle hydrodynamic stress contribution -- the Einstein viscosity correction -- must be removed from the suspension stress when used to predict particle flux. Our results validate a key assumption of the SBM and therefore revive its physical foundation.</description>

      <title>Depth-Aware Machine Learning Framework for Bubble Characterization in Two-Phase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the three-dimensional motion of bubbles is essential for interpreting transport and mixing in multiphase flows, especially when bubbles deform under shear or move rapidly through the flow field. In many laboratory setups, only a single high-speed camera is available, which limits measurements to two dimensions. Traditional image-processing tools can identify bubbles only when they appear circular and isolated, but they struggle with irregularly shaped bubbles, shear-induced deformations, strong blurring, and partial overlaps. Multi-camera systems could overcome these issues, but require significant hardware additions and calibration effort. In this work, we introduce a new machine-learning framework that can detect bubbles and estimate their depth using only a single 20 kHz high-speed camera with 3 \textmu m resolution. The method first uses a large unlabeled dataset and clusters the bubbles with an unsupervised algorithm to reveal their underlying structure. These clusters provide pseudo labels, which are combined with a small set of true in-plane bubble labels to train a semi-supervised model that generalizes across different bubble appearances. These components produce a continuous depth-proxy score that indicates how close each bubble is to the imaging plane, even when bubbles are distorted or irregularly shaped. In parallel, we perform robust bubble identification using instance segmentation, which separates touching, overlapping, and elongated bubbles generated by high-velocity shear. Quantitatively, the in-plane segmentation baseline achieves strong held-out performance with Average Precision (AP) = 0.818, implying stable detection across thresholds, clutter, bubble detection Precision of 0.901, and a False-Positive Rate (FPR) near 6.1\%, hence low spurious bubbles and cleaner statistics under the tested acquisition conditions.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric velocity boundary conditions lead to zonal flow in centrifugal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulations of rapidly rotating annular centrifugal convection to investigate how mixed (asymmetric) velocity boundary conditions and geometric curvature shape the flow organisation and heat transfer. Motivated by the quasi-two-dimensionalisation under strong rotation and the long spin-up required for large-scale states, we employ two-dimensional simulations and consider four boundary-condition sets: no-slip/no-slip (INON), no-slip/stress-free (INOS), stress-free/no-slip (ISON) and stress-free/stress-free (ISOS). For fixed geometry with the radius ratio $\eta=0.5$ and over the Rayleigh number $Ra\in[10^6,10^9]$, the heat transfer is strongest for ISOS, followed by INOS and INON, while ISON exhibits a pronounced suppression as a strong zonal flow aligned with the rotation develops. In the three cases dominated by large-scale circulation, the Nusselt number $Nu$ follows an effective classical-type scaling close to $Nu\sim Ra^{0.27}$, whereas the zonal-flow branch displays a much weaker scaling $Nu\sim Ra^{0.1}$ and strong flow anisotropy with the large difference between the radial and azimuthal Reynolds numbers $Re_r\ll Re_\varphi$. A dissipation analysis shows that zonal-flow formation is accompanied by a transition from boundary-layer-dominated dissipation to a relatively low and uniform bulk dissipation, consistent with shear-induced plume suppression. By varying the radius ratio $\eta$, we demonstrate that increasing $\eta$ weakens curvature asymmetry and destabilises the zonal-flow state, leading to roll-dominated convection in the planar limit, and we relate the accompanying bulk-temperature asymmetry to the boundary heat flux asymmetry using a free-convective boundary-layer model.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Aerodynamic Response and an Equivalent Static Wind-resistant Design for Anticlastic Conical Tensile Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conical Tensile Membrane Structure (TMS) is commonly used for aesthetics, economic design, high rain and snow loading. Such TMS shows complex aerodynamic behavior in presence of geometric nonlinearity, not adequately studied in the past. The aerodynamic responses of anticlastic conical TMS under random wind loading is presented herein along with an equivalent static wind resistant design approach. The stochastic wind loading on the TMS in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is simulated via the Large Eddy simulation (LES); which is detailed in a previous study by the authors and hence not repeated here. The aerodynamic loading is then employed as input in conducting the nonlinear time history analyses considering open (i.e. without facade) and closed (with facade) TMS, supported by peripheral/radial cables. The influence of the key parameters (aerodynamic roughness height, the rise-span ratio of the TMS and the membrane prestress, notably) are demonstrated. Although increasing prestress and rise-to-span ratio enhances the stiffness of TMS, the former shows dominance. Increasing roughness height also lead to increased peak loading/responses by enhanced turbulence. An equivalent static wind-resistant design is presented via the Gust Response Factors (GRFs) and an additional Nonlinear Adjustment Factors (NAFs). These factors are presented systematically, encompassing alternative scenarios. Multi-linear regression models are presented for predictive modeling of these factors, along with a probabilistic analysis for their design values that can be employed in practice bypassing an involved nonlinear dynamic analysis.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Wake Dynamics of a Slender Symmetric Trailing Edge Hydrofoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of wake dynamics behind hydrofoils is critical for mitigating vortex-induced vibrations and improving the performance of hydraulic machinery. Conventional turbulence modeling approaches often struggle to capture the unsteady, coherent structures governing wake behavior, particularly for slender hydrofoils operating at high Reynolds numbers. This study addresses this limitation by combining scale-resolving numerical simulations, including high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation (LES), with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements to investigate the turbulent wake of a symmetric, blunt trailing-edge hydrofoil operating at zero angle of attack. The flow was analyzed at a Reynolds number of approximately 7.5x10e5, i.e. close to the onset of wake-structure interaction effects. LES was performed using a fine mesh of approximately 500 million nodes to resolve near-wall and wake dynamics beyond the experimental field of view, while PIV measurements provided time-resolved velocity fields downstream of the trailing edge. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was applied to the PIV data to extract dominant coherent structures and quantify their contribution to the turbulent kinetic energy. POD analysis reveals that energy is distributed across many modes, with the leading mode capturing the primary wake dynamics and higher modes forming coupled oscillatory pairs associated with von Karman vortex shedding. PIV-LES agreement shows that central wake measurements combined with numerical simulations enables full wake reconstruction and validates modeling for vibration-relevant hydrofoil dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exact coherent structures as building blocks of turbulence on large domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact unstable solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations are thought to underpin the dynamics of turbulence, but are usually computed in minimal computational domains. Here, we extend this dynamical systems approach to spatially extended turbulent flows featuring multiple interacting 'substructures', and show how new simple invariant solutions can be constructed by spatial tiling of exact solutions from small-box calculations. Candidate solutions are found via gradient-based optimization of a scalar loss function which targets autorecurrence in spatially-masked regions of the flow. We apply these ideas to a vertically-extended Kolmogorov flow, where we first identify large numbers of relative periodic orbits (RPOs) which are combinations of high-dissipation, small-box solutions with laminar patches. We then show that vertically-stacked combinations of pairs of distinct small-box RPOs can form robust guesses for dynamically-relevant two-tori in the larger domain. Finally, we show how our optimization procedure can identify 'turbulent' trajectories which locally shadow a small-box RPO for multiple periods in a subdomain. These small-box combinations are possible as the flow spends prolonged periods in a regime where it can be effectively considered as a pair of weakly-coupled small-box systems, due to shielding effects associated with higher-dissipation flow structures.</description>

      <title>Learning Transient Convective Heat Transfer with Geometry Aware World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) simulations are fundamental to engineering and physics but are often computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples.</description>

      <title>An efficient implicit scheme for the multimaterial Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stratified fluids composed of a sequence of alternate layers show interesting macroscopic properties, which may be quite different from those of the individual constituent fluids. On a macroscopic scale, such systems can be considered a sort of fluid metamaterial. In many cases each fluid layer can be described by Euler equations following the stiffened gas equation of state. The computation of detailed numerical solutions of such stratified material poses several challenges, first and foremost the issue of artificial smearing of material parameters across interface boundaries. Lagrangian schemes completely eliminate this issue, but at the cost of rather stringent time step restrictions. In this work we introduce an implicit numerical method for the multimaterial Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates. The implicit discretization is aimed at bypassing the prohibitive time step restrictions present in flows with stratified media, where one of the materials is particularly dense, or rigid (or both). This is the case for flows of water-air mixtures, air-granular media, or similar high density ratio systems. We will present the novel discretisation approach, which makes extensive use of the remarkable structure of the governing equations in Lagrangian coordinates to find the solution by means of a single implicit discrete wave equation for the pressure field, yielding a symmetric positive definite structure and thus a particularly efficient algorithm. Additionally, we will introduce simple filtering strategies for counteracting the emergence of pressure or density oscillations typically encountered in multimaterial flows, and will present results concerning the robustness, accuracy, and performance of the proposed method, including applications to stratified media with high density and stiffness ratios.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid semi-Lagrangian Flow Mapping Approach for Vlasov Systems: Combining Iterative and Compositional Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid semi-Lagrangian scheme for the Vlasov--Poisson equation that combines the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) method with the Characteristic Mapping Method (CMM). Both approaches exploit the semi-group property of the underlying diffeomorphic flow, enabling the reconstruction of solutions through flow maps that trace characteristics back to their initial positions. NuFI builds this flow map iteratively, preserving symplectic structure and conserving invariants, but its computational cost scales quadratically with time. Its advantage lies in a compact, low-dimensional representation depending only on the electric field. In contrast, CMM achieves low computational costs when remapping by composing the global flow map from explicitly stored submaps. The proposed hybrid method merges these strengths: NuFi is employed for accurate and conservative local time stepping, while CMM efficiently propagates the solution through submap composition. This approach reduces storage requirements, maintains accuracy, and improves structural properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme and highlight the trade-offs between memory usage and computational cost. We benchmark against a semi-Lagrangian predictor-corrector scheme used in modern gyrokinetic codes, evaluating accuracy and conservation properties.</description>

      <title>LLM4Fluid: Large Language Models as Generalizable Neural Solvers for Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem, where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure, we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales (the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$) governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When $\tau_\mathrm{diff} \sim \tau_\mathrm{pv}$, we uncover a nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</description>

      <title>Magnetorheological Characterization of Blood Analogues Seeded with Paramagnetic Particles</title>

Abstract: Magnetic particle under external fields can be useful in various medical applications, gaining access to the whole body if deployed in the bloodstream. Localised drug delivery, haemorrhage control, and cancer treatment are among the applications that have the potential to become revolutionary therapies. Despite this interest, a magnetorheological characterisation of particle-seeded blood has yet to be achieved. In this work, we evaluate the magnetorheological response of blood analogues seeded with paramagnetic particles in different concentrations, under the effects of a uniform, density-varying magnetic field. Through steady shear experiments, we encounter the usual magnetically-induced shear thinning response, and oscillatory shear results point toward significant alterations in the fluids' microstructure. However, experimental limitations make it difficult to accurately evaluate the oscillatory shear response of such rheologically subtle fluids, limiting both the quality and quantity of achievable information. Despite experimental limitations, our results demonstrate that magnetic fields can induce marked and quantifiable rheological changes in seeded blood analogues. The framework established here provides a foundation for future studies on real blood samples and for the design of magnetically responsive biomedical systems.</description>

      <title>Intermittency suppression in turbulence via forced light particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how turbulence is reshaped by the presence of externally forced light particles, using high-resolution direct numerical simulations with four-way coupling. The particles are subject to an oscillatory force that in turn locally affects the fluid flow through momentum exchange at the position of the particles. Since the light particles preferentially concentrate in high vorticity regions, this leads to an intricate preferential turbulence modulation. We show that through this modulation, the forced light particles strongly reduce the intermittency of the flow, shedding new light on the delicate relationship between vortex filaments and turbulence intermittency.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extended Lubrication Theories for Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lubrication theory makes use of the assumptions of a long and thin fluid domain and a small scaled Reynolds number to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Extended lubrication theory aims to improve the model accuracy by relaxing these assumptions and including additional terms in the formulation. However, such models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended lubrication theory, and compare our model with several existing models, along with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries. The magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication theory models.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of small bubbles in turbulence in non-dilute conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows laden with small bubbles are ubiquitous in many natural and industrial environments. From the point of view of numerical modeling, to be able to handle a very large number of small bubbles in direct numerical simulations, one traditionally relies on the one-way coupling paradigm. There, bubbles are passively advected and are non-interacting, implicitly assuming dilute conditions. Here, we study bubbles that are four-way coupled, where both the feedback on the fluid and excluded-volume interactions between bubbles are taken into account. We find that, while the back-reaction from the bubble phase onto the fluid phase remains energetically small under most circumstances, the excluded-volume interactions between bubbles can have a significant influence on the Lagrangian statistics of the bubble dynamics. We show that as the volume fraction of bubbles increases, the preferential concentration of bubbles in filamentary high-vorticity regions decreases as these strong vortical structures get filled up; this happens at a volume fraction of around one percent for $\textrm{Re}_\lambda=O(10^2)$. We furthermore study the influence on the Lagrangian velocity structure function as well as pair dispersion, and find that, while the mean dispersive behavior remains close to that obtained from one-way coupling simulations, some evident signatures of bubble collisions can be retrieved from the structure functions and the distribution of the dispersion, even at very small volume fractions. This work not only teaches us about the circumstances under which four-way coupling becomes important, but also opens up new directions towards probing and ultimately manipulating coherent vortical structures in small-scale turbulence using bubbles.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Transformer operator for the prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven turbulence prediction methods often face challenges related to data dependency and lack of physical interpretability. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed Transformer operator (PITO) and its implicit variant (PIITO) for predicting three-dimensional (3D) turbulence, which are developed based on the vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with an appropriate patch size. Given the current flow field, the Transformer operator computes its prediction for the next time step. By embedding the large-eddy simulation (LES) equations into the loss function, PITO and PIITO can learn solution operators without using labeled data. Furthermore, PITO can automatically learn the subgrid scale (SGS) coefficient using a single set of flow data during training. Both PITO and PIITO exhibit excellent stability and accuracy on the predictions of various statistical properties and flow structures for the situation of long-term extrapolation exceeding 25 times the training horizon in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), and outperform the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (PIFNO). Furthermore, PITO exhibits a remarkable accuracy on the predictions of forced HIT where PIFNO fails. Notably, PITO and PIITO reduce GPU memory consumption by 79.5\% and 91.3\% while requiring only 31.5\% and 3.1\% of the parameters, respectively, compared to PIFNO. Moreover, both PITO and PIITO models are much faster compared to traditional LES method.</description>

      <title>Aging in the Flow Dynamics of Dense Suspensions of Contactless Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that the free-surface flow dynamics of dense piles of contactless silica microparticles depend on the resting period prior to flow. Microfluidic rotating drum experiments reveal that longer resting times lead to delayed flow onsets and reduced flow velocities, both evolving logarithmically with the resting time. These aging-like effects are more pronounced for thermally driven creep flows in piles with initial tilting angle below the athermal angle of repose, in contrast to piles initially tilted above this repose angle, where gravity-driven flows tend to gradually erase aging effects. Moreover, we show that the packing fraction does not change during the resting period, and that aging occurs in both monodisperse and polydisperse piles, indicating that crystallization is not required for the time-dependent behavior to appear. Remarkably, vigorous agitation that re-disperses the particles fully restores the piles to their initial state, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to sample degradation. These findings evidence a form of aging in quiescent suspensions intermediate between colloidal and granular media, where thermal fluctuations, still significant relative to particle weight, progressively stabilize the system, making it more resistant to flow and deformation.</description>
