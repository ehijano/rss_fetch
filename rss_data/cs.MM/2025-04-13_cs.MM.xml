      <title>ScreenSpot-Pro: GUI Grounding for Professional High-Resolution Computer Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have led to significant progress in developing GUI agents for general tasks such as web browsing and mobile phone use. However, their application in professional domains remains under-explored. These specialized workflows introduce unique challenges for GUI perception models, including high-resolution displays, smaller target sizes, and complex environments. In this paper, we introduce ScreenSpot-Pro, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the grounding capabilities of MLLMs in high-resolution professional settings. The benchmark comprises authentic high-resolution images from a variety of professional domains with expert annotations. It spans 23 applications across five industries and three operating systems. Existing GUI grounding models perform poorly on this dataset, with the best model achieving only 18.9%. Our experiments reveal that strategically reducing the search area enhances accuracy. Based on this insight, we propose ScreenSeekeR, a visual search method that utilizes the GUI knowledge of a strong planner to guide a cascaded search, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 48.1% without any additional training. We hope that our benchmark and findings will advance the development of GUI agents for professional applications.

      <title>Palmprint De-Identification Using Diffusion Model for High-Quality and Diverse Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Palmprint recognition techniques have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling reliable recognition even when palmprints are captured in uncontrolled or challenging environments. However, this strength also introduces new risks, as publicly available palmprint images can be misused by adversaries for malicious activities. Despite this growing concern, research on methods to obscure or anonymize palmprints remains largely unexplored. Thus, it is essential to develop a palmprint de-identification technique capable of removing identity-revealing features while retaining the image's utility and preserving non-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models to generate diverse, high-quality palmprint images that conceal identity features for de-identification purposes. To ensure greater stability and controllability in the synthesis process, we incorporate a semantic-guided embedding fusion alongside a prior interpolation mechanism. We further propose the de-identification ratio, a novel metric for intuitive de-identification assessment. Extensive experiments across multiple palmprint datasets and recognition methods demonstrate that our method effectively conceals identity-related traits with significant diversity across de-identified samples. The de-identified samples preserve high visual fidelity and maintain excellent usability, achieving a balance between de-identification and retaining non-identity information.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Diffusion-based Neural Speech Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, neural speech codecs (NSCs) trained as generative models have shown superior performance compared to conventional codecs at low bitrates. Although most state-of-the-art NSCs are trained as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models (DMs), a recent class of generative models, represent a promising alternative due to their superior performance in image generation relative to GANs. Consequently, DMs have been successfully applied for audio and speech coding among various other audio generation applications. However, the design of diffusion-based NSCs has not yet been explored in a systematic way. We address this by providing a comprehensive analysis of diffusion-based NSCs divided into three contributions. First, we propose a categorization based on the conditioning and output domains of the DM. This simple conceptual framework allows us to define a design space for diffusion-based NSCs and to assign a category to existing approaches in the literature. Second, we systematically investigate unexplored designs by creating and evaluating new diffusion-based NSCs within the conceptual framework. Finally, we compare the proposed models to existing GAN and DM baselines through objective metrics and subjective listening tests.</description>

      <title>Construction of Hyperchaotic Maps Based on 3D-CCC and its Applications in Image Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The security performance of chaos-based image encryption algorithms heavily depends on the complexity of the underlying chaotic system. To enhance encryption effectiveness, it is crucial to design chaotic systems with improved dynamic properties. This paper proposes a novel approach, the 3D Cascaded Cross-Coupling Method (3D-CCC), for constructing 3D hyperchaotic systems by combining three one-dimensional chaotic systems, which can be identical or different. Using this method, we develop a new 3D hyperchaotic map, 3D-ICCCLS, which exhibits superior chaotic characteristics, including good ergodicity, randomness, positive Lyapunov exponents, and high spectral entropy. Furthermore, we introduce a color image encryption algorithm based on 3D-ICCCLS. The proposed scheme treats the three color channels as an integrated unit, employing cross-channel bit mixing followed by simultaneous permutation and diffusion. This approach achieves a strong encryption effect in a single round. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm provides a large key space, high key sensitivity, and strong resistance against common attacks,</description>
