      <title>Dynamically Tunable Helical Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial FPV systems demand ultra-low latency, high-reliability communication links. At high speeds and in cluttered environments, Doppler shifts and rapid multipath changes can dramatically raise packet error rates. This paper investigates these phenomena in the context of ExpressLRS (ELRS) long-range FPV control links and demonstrates a novel solution: real-time geometry tuning of a circularly polarized helical antenna array. This study integrates Maxwell-equation-based full-wave simulations (via Ansys HFSS) with controlled, blind field trials to validate performance. A new analysis framework incorporates Doppler-induced frequency offset into the antenna's radiation pattern and the system's error model. Compared to a conventional fixed antenna, the adaptive helical array shows a 20-30% PER reduction when drones exceed 150 mph. The adaptive system automatically adjusts coil pitch and diameter to retune the antenna as flight parameters (velocity, attitude) change. Measured VSWR stays near unity, preventing transmitter reflection spikes. RSSI variation is reduced by half, indicating stronger link stability in urban multi-path. A regression analysis confirms that the reduction in PER due to tuning is highly statistically significant. Calibration data and error analyses are provided to validate our methodology. These findings advance the understanding of high-mobility UAV communication channels and demonstrate that reconfigurable hardware-here, mechanically tunable helices-can effectively counter Doppler and multi-path impairments. The findings inform new design principles for UAV antenna arrays and suggest a path toward AI-integrated adaptive RF systems for drone swarms and racing platforms.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Underwater Acoustic Target Positioning and Tracking: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater target tracking technology plays a pivotal role in marine resource exploration, environmental monitoring, and national defense security. Given that acoustic waves represent an effective medium for long-distance transmission in aquatic environments, underwater acoustic target tracking has become a prominent research area of underwater communications and networking. Existing literature reviews often offer a narrow perspective or inadequately address the paradigm shifts driven by emerging technologies like deep learning and reinforcement learning. To address these gaps, this work presents a systematic survey of this field and introduces an innovative multidimensional taxonomy framework based on target scale, sensor perception modes, and sensor collaboration patterns. Within this framework, we comprehensively survey the literature (more than 180 publications) over the period 2016-2025, spanning from the theoretical foundations to diverse algorithmic approaches in underwater acoustic target tracking. Particularly, we emphasize the transformative potential and recent advancements of machine learning techniques, including deep learning and reinforcement learning, in enhancing the performance and adaptability of underwater tracking systems. Finally, this survey concludes by identifying key challenges in the field and proposing future avenues based on emerging technologies such as federated learning, blockchain, embodied intelligence, and large models.</description>

      <title>Distributed Activity Detection for Cell-Free Hybrid Near-Far Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A great amount of endeavor has recently been devoted to activity detection for massive machine-type communications in cell-free massive MIMO. However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing. In particular, a novel coordinate descent algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update with Taylor expansion is proposed to handle the local detection problem at each AP. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how the hybrid near-far field channels affect the detection performance. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Node Selection in Hexagonal Grid Topology for TDoA-Based UAV Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization problem for TDoA-based UAV localization in low-altitude urban environments with hexagonal grid node deployment. We derive a lightweight optimized node selection strategy based on only RSSI measurements, to pre-select optimal nodes, avoiding extensive TDoA measurements in energy-constrained UAV scenarios. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that dynamically selecting the number of reference nodes improves localization performance while minimizing resource overhead.</description>

      <title>Performance Characterization of Continuous Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that can implement a phase rotation continuously over the whole surface rather than via a finite number of discrete elements. Such an RIS can be considered a design for future systems where advances in metamaterials make such an implementation feasible or as the limiting case where the number of elements in a traditional RIS increases in a given area. We derive the optimal RIS design for the single-user (SU) scenario assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) from the RIS to the base station (BS) and correlated Rayleigh fading for the other links. We also derive the associated optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its mean, a bound on the mean spectral efficiency (SE), an approximation to the SNR outage probability and an approximation to the coefficient of variation for the investigation of channel hardening.</description>

      <title>Widely Linear Augmented Extreme Learning Machine Based Impairments Compensation for Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite communications are crucial for the evolution beyond fifth-generation networks. However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution.</description>

      <title>The Perception of Phase Intercept Distortion and its Application in Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase distortion refers to the alteration of the phase relationships between frequencies in a signal, which can be perceptible. In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Integrating Movable Antennas and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (MA-IRS): Fundamentals, Practical Solutions, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) enable active antenna repositioning and passive phase-shift tuning for channel reconfiguration, respectively. Integrating MAs and IRSs boosts spatial degrees of freedom, significantly enhancing wireless network capacity, coverage, and reliability. In this article, we first present the fundamentals of MA-IRS integration, involving clarifying the key design issues, revealing performance gain, and identifying the conditions where MA-IRS synergy persists. Then, we examine practical challenges and propose pragmatic design solutions, including optimization schemes, hardware architectures, deployment strategies, and robust designs for hardware impairments and mobility management. In addition, we highlight how MA-IRS architectures uniquely support advanced integrated sensing and communication, enhancing sensing performance and dual-functional flexibility. Overall, MA-IRS integration emerges as a compelling approach toward next-generation reconfigurable wireless systems.</description>

      <title>A stochastic noise model based excess noise factor expressions for staircase avalanche photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue of photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with twofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Radar was studied in many Nations for about fifteen years with the production of some hundred publications. In the post 2020 literature, it is shown that, due to the exceedingly low transmitted power, Quantum Radar cannot produce neither significant results nor real world applications. Regrettably, most of the scientific community ignored this negative outcome: a fact worth of exam. A detailed study of such an assessment failure depicts the main shortcomings of the present situation, calling for a redesign of the research assessment at the international level, with proposals shown in the ending section of this paper.</description>

      <title>The Trip to ZigBee Backscatter across a Decade, a Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of backscatter communication has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from a niche technology for radio-frequency identification (RFID) into a sophisticated paradigm poised to enable a truly battery-free Internet of Things (IoT). This evolution is built upon a deepening understanding of the fundamental principles governing these ultra-low-power links. Modern backscatter systems are no longer simple reflectors of continuous waves but are increasingly designed to interact with complex, data-carrying ambient signals from ubiquitous sources like WiFi, ZigBee, and cellular networks. This review systematically charts the journey of ambient backscatter, particularly focusing on its interaction with ZigBee and other commodity wireless protocols over the last decade. We analyze the progression from foundational proof-of-concept systems that established productive backscatter to modern high-throughput, concurrent, and cross-technology communication architectures. Key advancements in fine-grained modulation, robust synchronization, cross-technology physical layer emulation, and multi-tag coordination are detailed. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art systems highlights the core trade-offs between performance metrics like data rate and range, power consumption, and compatibility with commodity hardware. Finally, we synthesize the primary challenges, including networking scalability, security vulnerabilities, the near-far problem, and practical deployment hurdles, and outline future research directions, such as integration with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and 6G networks, that promise to further expand the capabilities of this transformative technology.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Driven Radar-Inertial Fusion for Instantaneous 3D Ego-Velocity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for estimating ego-velocity in autonomous navigation by integrating high-resolution imaging radar with an inertial measurement unit. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of traditional radar-based ego-motion estimation techniques by employing a neural network to process complex-valued raw radar data and estimate instantaneous linear ego-velocity along with its associated uncertainty. This uncertainty-aware velocity estimate is then integrated with inertial measurement unit data using an Extended Kalman Filter. The filter leverages the network-predicted uncertainty to refine the inertial sensor's noise and bias parameters, improving the overall robustness and accuracy of the ego-motion estimation. We evaluated the proposed method on the publicly available ColoRadar dataset. Our approach achieves significantly lower error compared to the closest publicly available method and also outperforms both instantaneous and scan matching-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Capacity Characterization of Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike conventional systems using a fixed-location antenna, the channel capacity of the pinching-antenna system (PASS) is determined by the activated positions of pinching antennas. This article characterizes the capacity region of multiuser PASS, where a single pinched waveguide is deployed to enable both uplink and downlink communications. The capacity region of the uplink channel is first characterized. \romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case, closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal antenna activation position, along with the corresponding capacity region and the achievable data rate regions under time-division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). It is proven that the capacity region of PASS encompasses that of conventional fixed-antenna systems, and that the FDMA rate region contains the TDMA rate region. \romannumeral2) For the multiple-pinch case, inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived using an element-wise alternating antenna position optimization technique and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, respectively. The achievable FDMA rate region is also derived using the same optimization framework, while the TDMA rate region is obtained through an antenna position refinement approach. The analysis is then extended to the downlink PASS using the uplink-downlink duality framework. It is proven that the relationships among the downlink capacity and rate regions are consistent with those in the uplink case. Numerical results demonstrate that: \romannumeral1) the derived bounds closely approximate the exact capacity region, \romannumeral2) PASS yields a significantly enlarged capacity region compared to conventional fixed-antenna systems, and \romannumeral3) in the multiple-pinch case, TDMA and FDMA are capable of approaching the channel capacity limit.</description>

      <title>Fronthaul-Aware User-Centric Generalized Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fronthaul-limited generalized zeroforcing-based cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems with multiple-antenna users and multipleantenna access points (APs) relying on both cooperative beamforming (CB) and user-centric (UC) clustering. The proposed framework is very general and can be degenerated into different special cases, such as pure CB/pure UC clustering, or fully centralized CB/fully distributed beamforming. We comprehensively analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the system wherein the users use the minimum mean-squared errorbased successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) scheme to detect the desired signals. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the user association and power control for maximizing the sum SE. The formulated problem is under per-AP transmit power and fronthaul constraints, and is based on only long-term channel state information (CSI). The challenging formulated problem is transformed into tractable form and a novel algorithm is proposed to solve it using minorization maximization (MM) technique. We analyze the trade-offs provided by the CF-mMIMO system with different number of CB clusters, hence highlighting the importance of the appropriate choice of CB design for different system setups. Numerical results show that for the centralized CB, the proposed power optimization provides nearly 59% improvement in the average sum SE over the heuristic approach, and 312% improvement, when the distributed beamforming is employed.</description>

      <title>Joint Error Correction and Fading Channel Estimation Enhancement Leveraging GRAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for error correction in the presence of fading channel estimation errors (CEE). When such errors are significant, considerable performance losses can be observed if the wireless transceiver is not adapted. Instead of refining the estimate by increasing the pilot sequence length or improving the estimation algorithm, we propose two new approaches based on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) decoders. The first method involves testing multiple candidates for the channel estimate located in the complex neighborhood around the original pilot-based estimate. All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR). These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword. The second method is a refined version of the first approach accounting for the presence of residual CEE in the LLR computation. The performance of these two techniques is evaluated for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes. For the considered settings, block error rate (BLER) gains of several dBs are observed compared to cases where CEE is ignored.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information-oriented ISAC Beamforming Design for Large Dimensional Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) beamforming design were mostly designed under perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), limiting their use in practical dynamic environments. In this paper, we study the beamforming design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC systems based on statistical CSI, with the weighted mutual information (MI) comprising sensing and communication perspectives adopted as the performance metric. In particular, the operator-valued free probability theory is utilized to derive the closed-form expression for the weighted MI under statistical CSI. Subsequently, an efficient projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm is proposed to optimize the transmit beamforming matrix with the aim of maximizing the weighted MI.Numerical results validate that the derived closed-form expression matches well with the Monte Carlo simulation results and the proposed optimization algorithm is able to improve the weighted MI significantly. We also illustrate the trade-off between sensing and communication MI.</description>

      <title>A New Proof for the Linear Filtering and Smoothing Equations, and Asymptotic Expansion of Nonlinear Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new asymptotic expansion approach for nonlinear filtering based on a small parameter in the system noise. This method expresses the filtering distribution as a power series in the noise level, where the coefficients can be computed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. As a result, it addresses the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters. In the course of our derivation, we also show that classical linear filtering and smoothing equations, namely Kalman-Bucy filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother, can be obtained in a unified and transparent manner from an explicit formula for the conditional distribution of the hidden path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the happiest accidents in all math is the ease of transforming a function to and taking derivatives in the Fourier frequency domain. But in order to exploit this extraordinary fact without serious artefacting, and in order to be able to use a computer, we need quite a bit of extra knowledge and care. This document sets out the math behind the spectral-derivatives Python package. I touch on fundamental signal processing and calculus concepts as necessary and build upwards.</description>

      <title>Computation Capacity Maximization for Pinching Antennas-Assisted Wireless Powered MEC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper,we investigate a novel wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system assisted by pinching antennas (PAs), where devices first harvest energy from a base station and then offload computation-intensive tasks to an MEC server. As an emerging technology, PAs utilize long dielectric waveguides embedded with multiple localized dielectric particles, which can be spatially configured through a pinching mechanism to effectively reduce large-scale propagation loss. This capability facilitates both efficient downlink energy transfer and uplink task offloading. To fully exploit these advantages, we adopt a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework and formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the system's computational capacity by jointly optimizing device transmit power, time allocation, PA positions in both uplink and downlink, and radiation control. To address the resulting non-convexity caused by variable coupling, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm that integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) with successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted design substantially improves both energy harvesting efficiency and computational performance compared to conventional antenna systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents an effective method for assessing the feasibility of detecting ocean ships using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The technique employs the minimum detectable radar cross-section criterion under specified false alarm and detection probabilities. The benefits of the proposed method are illustrated by evaluating the feasibility of detecting small ships with SAR from a satellite in very low Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>From Ground to Sky: Architectures, Applications, and Challenges Shaping Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), which is a reconfigurable, three-dimensional (3D) layered architecture. In particular, the LAWN integrates connectivity, sensing, control, and computing across aerial and terrestrial nodes that enable seamless operation in complex, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. Different from the conventional aerial communication systems, LAWN's distinctive feature is its tight integration of functional planes in which multiple functionalities continually reshape themselves to operate safely and efficiently in the low-altitude sky. With the LAWN, we discuss several enabling technologies, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication, and fully-actuated control systems. Finally, we identify potential applications and key cross-layer challenges. This article offers a comprehensive roadmap for future research and development in the low-altitude airspace.</description>

      <title>Generative Deep Learning and Signal Processing for Data Augmentation of Cardiac Auscultation Signals: Improving Model Robustness Using Synthetic Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately interpreting cardiac auscultation signals plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases. However, the paucity of labelled data inhibits classification models' training. Researchers have turned to generative deep learning techniques combined with signal processing to augment the existing data and improve cardiac auscultation classification models to overcome this challenge. However, the primary focus of prior studies has been on model performance as opposed to model robustness. Robustness, in this case, is defined as both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance by measures such as Matthew's correlation coefficient. This work shows that more robust abnormal heart sound classifiers can be trained using an augmented dataset. The augmentations consist of traditional audio approaches and the creation of synthetic audio conditionally generated using the WaveGrad and DiffWave diffusion models. It is found that both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance can be improved over various datasets when training a convolutional neural network-based classification model with this augmented dataset. With the performance increase encompassing not only accuracy but also balanced accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient, an augmented dataset significantly contributes to resolving issues of imbalanced datasets. This, in turn, helps provide a more general and robust classifier.</description>

      <title>DFT-s-OFDM-based On-Off Keying for Low-Power Wake-Up Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 5G-Advanced and likely 6G will support a new low-power wake-up signal (LP-WUS) enabling low-power devices, equipped with a complementary ultra low-power receiver to monitor wireless traffic, to completely switch off their main radio. This orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) signal will emulate an on-off keying (OOK) modulation to enable very low-energy envelope detection at the receiver. Higher rate LP-WUS, containing multiple OOK symbols within single OFDM symbol, will be generated using the time-domain pulse multiplexing of discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) OFDM. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive signal design framework for DFT-s-OFDM-based OOK generation. General properties of subcarrier coefficients are derived demonstrating that only DFT of the bits needs to be computed online and repeated over the band before applying appropriate frequency-domain processing. The conventional approach of generating rectangular-like OOK waveforms is then addressed by a combination of pre-DFT bit-spreading and post-DFT processing; and the least-squares (LS) method from Mazloum and Edfors, proposed for 5G LP-WUS and also Ambient-IoT, is shown to be implementable as such. Even though aesthetically pleasing and of independent interest, rectangular-like OOK waveforms are not optimal for 5G LP-WUS scenarios due to their limited robustness to channel frequency-selectivity and timing offset, and so shaping methods for spreading the OOK spectrum and concentrating the OOK symbol energy are analyzed and shown to improve the bit error rate performance under practical conditions.</description>

      <title>ArrayDPS: Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR. Audio demos are provided at: https://arraydps.github.io/ArrayDPSDemo/.</description>
