      <title>Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence of the Expectation Maximization algorithm under a logarithmic Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing recently developed tools for constructing gradient flows on Wasserstein spaces, we extend an analysis technique commonly employed to understand alternating minimization algorithms on Euclidean space to the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm via its representation as coordinate-wise minimization on the product of a Euclidean space and a space of probability distributions due to Neal and Hinton (1998). In so doing we obtain finite sample error bounds and exponential convergence of the EM algorithm under a natural generalisation of a log-Sobolev inequality. We further demonstrate that the analysis technique is sufficiently flexible to allow also the analysis of several variants of the EM algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Tokens as Data Points for Generalization Bounds on Larger Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters excel at predicting the next token in a sequence. Recent work computes non-vacuous compression-based generalization bounds for LLMs, but these bounds are vacuous for large models at the billion-parameter scale. Moreover, these bounds are obtained through restrictive compression techniques, bounding compressed models that generate low-quality text. Additionally, the tightness of these existing bounds depends on the number of IID documents in a training set rather than the much larger number of non-IID constituent tokens, leaving untapped potential for tighter bounds. In this work, we instead use properties of martingales to derive generalization bounds that benefit from the vast number of tokens in LLM training sets. Since a dataset contains far more tokens than documents, our generalization bounds not only tolerate but actually benefit from far less restrictive compression schemes. With Monarch matrices, Kronecker factorizations, and post-training quantization, we achieve non-vacuous generalization bounds for LLMs as large as LLaMA2-70B. Unlike previous approaches, our work achieves the first non-vacuous bounds for models that are deployed in practice and generate high-quality text.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Quantum Advantage and Rapid Retraining in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16020v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. Our approach demonstrates sparks of quantum advantage through faster training times compared to classical optimizers such as the Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experimental results on initial training of classification and regression tasks validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant speedups and comparable performance to classical methods. While experiments on retraining demonstrate a sixty times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be even larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.</description>

      <title>Driving pattern interpretation based on action phases clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to identifying driving heterogeneity face challenges in comprehending fundamental patterns from the perspective of underlying driving behavior mechanisms. The concept of Action phases was proposed in our previous work, capturing the diversity of driving characteristics with physical meanings. This study presents a novel framework to further interpret driving patterns by classifying Action phases in an unsupervised manner. In this framework, a Resampling and Downsampling Method (RDM) is first applied to standardize the length of Action phases. Then the clustering calibration procedure including ''Feature Selection'', ''Clustering Analysis'', ''Difference/Similarity Evaluation'', and ''Action phases Re-extraction'' is iteratively applied until all differences among clusters and similarities within clusters reach the pre-determined criteria. Application of the framework using real-world datasets revealed six driving patterns in the I80 dataset, labeled as ''Catch up'', ''Keep away'', and ''Maintain distance'', with both ''Stable'' and ''Unstable'' states. Notably, Unstable patterns are more numerous than Stable ones. ''Maintain distance'' is the most common among Stable patterns. These observations align with the dynamic nature of driving. Two patterns ''Stable keep away'' and ''Unstable catch up'' are missing in the US101 dataset, which is in line with our expectations as this dataset was previously shown to have less heterogeneity. This demonstrates the potential of driving patterns in describing driving heterogeneity. The proposed framework promises advantages in addressing label scarcity in supervised learning and enhancing tasks such as driving behavior modeling and driving trajectory prediction.</description>

      <title>Generative Learning for Simulation of US Army Vehicle Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel generative model to simulate vehicle health and forecast faults, conditioned on practical operational considerations. The model, trained on data from the US Army's Predictive Logistics program, aims to support predictive maintenance. It forecasts faults far enough in advance to execute a maintenance intervention before a breakdown occurs. The model incorporates real-world factors that affect vehicle health. It also allows us to understand the vehicle's condition by analyzing operating data, and characterizing each vehicle into discrete states. Importantly, the model predicts the time to first fault with high accuracy. We compare its performance to other models and demonstrate its successful training.</description>

      <title>Transformers on Markov Data: Constant Depth Suffices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention-based transformers have been remarkably successful at modeling generative processes across various domains and modalities. In this paper, we study the behavior of transformers on data drawn from \kth Markov processes, where the conditional distribution of the next symbol in a sequence depends on the previous $k$ symbols observed. We observe a surprising phenomenon empirically which contradicts previous findings: when trained for sufficiently long, a transformer with a fixed depth and $1$ head per layer is able to achieve low test loss on sequences drawn from \kth Markov sources, even as $k$ grows. Furthermore, this low test loss is achieved by the transformer's ability to represent and learn the in-context conditional empirical distribution. On the theoretical side, our main result is that a transformer with a single head and three layers can represent the in-context conditional empirical distribution for \kth Markov sources, concurring with our empirical observations. Along the way, we prove that \textit{attention-only} transformers with $O(\log_2(k))$ layers can represent the in-context conditional empirical distribution by composing induction heads to track the previous $k$ symbols in the sequence. These results provide more insight into our current understanding of the mechanisms by which transformers learn to capture context, by understanding their behavior on Markov sources.</description>

      <title>Doubly Robust Conditional Independence Testing with Generative Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the problem of testing the conditional independence of two generic random vectors $X$ and $Y$ given a third random vector $Z$, which plays an important role in statistical and machine learning applications. We propose a new non-parametric testing procedure that avoids explicitly estimating any conditional distributions but instead requires sampling from the two marginal conditional distributions of $X$ given $Z$ and $Y$ given $Z$. We further propose using a generative neural network (GNN) framework to sample from these approximated marginal conditional distributions, which tends to mitigate the curse of dimensionality due to its adaptivity to any low-dimensional structures and smoothness underlying the data. Theoretically, our test statistic is shown to enjoy a doubly robust property against GNN approximation errors, meaning that the test statistic retains all desirable properties of the oracle test statistic utilizing the true marginal conditional distributions, as long as the product of the two approximation errors decays to zero faster than the parametric rate. Asymptotic properties of our statistic and the consistency of a bootstrap procedure are derived under both null and local alternatives. Extensive numerical experiments and real data analysis illustrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our proposed test.</description>

      <title>Superior Scoring Rules for Probabilistic Evaluation of Single-Label Multi-Class Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces novel superior scoring rules called Penalized Brier Score (PBS) and Penalized Logarithmic Loss (PLL) to improve model evaluation for probabilistic classification. Traditional scoring rules like Brier Score and Logarithmic Loss sometimes assign better scores to misclassifications in comparison with correct classifications. This discrepancy from the actual preference for rewarding correct classifications can lead to suboptimal model selection. By integrating penalties for misclassifications, PBS and PLL modify traditional proper scoring rules to consistently assign better scores to correct predictions. Formal proofs demonstrate that PBS and PLL satisfy strictly proper scoring rule properties while also preferentially rewarding accurate classifications. Experiments showcase the benefits of using PBS and PLL for model selection, model checkpointing, and early stopping. PBS exhibits a higher negative correlation with the F1 score compared to the Brier Score during training. Thus, PBS more effectively identifies optimal checkpoints and early stopping points, leading to improved F1 scores. Comparative analysis verifies models selected by PBS and PLL achieve superior F1 scores. Therefore, PBS and PLL address the gap between uncertainty quantification and accuracy maximization by encapsulating both proper scoring principles and explicit preference for true classifications. The proposed metrics can enhance model evaluation and selection for reliable probabilistic classification.</description>

      <title>Targeted stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo for hidden Markov models with rare latent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.13431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for hidden Markov models often rely on the forward-backward sampler. This makes them computationally slow as the length of the time series increases, motivating the development of sub-sampling-based approaches. These approximate the full posterior by using small random subsequences of the data at each MCMC iteration within stochastic gradient MCMC. In the presence of imbalanced data resulting from rare latent states, subsequences often exclude rare latent state data, leading to inaccurate inference and prediction/detection of rare events. We propose a targeted sub-sampling (TASS) approach that over-samples observations corresponding to rare latent states when calculating the stochastic gradient of parameters associated with them. TASS uses an initial clustering of the data to construct subsequence weights that reduce the variance in gradient estimation. This leads to improved sampling efficiency, in particular in settings where the rare latent states correspond to extreme observations. We demonstrate substantial gains in predictive and inferential accuracy on real and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>Natural Gradient Hybrid Variational Inference with Application to Deep Mixed Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic models with global parameters and latent variables are common, and for which variational inference (VI) is popular. However, existing methods are often either slow or inaccurate in high dimensions. We suggest a fast and accurate VI method for this case that employs a well-defined natural gradient variational optimization that targets the joint posterior of the global parameters and latent variables. It is a hybrid method, where at each step the global parameters are updated using the natural gradient and the latent variables are generated from their conditional posterior. A fast to compute expression for the Tikhonov damped Fisher information matrix is used, along with the re-parameterization trick, to provide a stable natural gradient. We apply the approach to deep mixed models, which are an emerging class of Bayesian neural networks with random output layer coefficients to allow for heterogeneity. A range of simulations show that using the natural gradient is substantially more efficient than using the ordinary gradient, and that the approach is faster and more accurate than two cutting-edge natural gradient VI methods. In a financial application we show that accounting for industry level heterogeneity using the deep mixed model improves the accuracy of asset pricing models. MATLAB code to implement the method can be found at: https://github.com/WeibenZhang07/NG-HVI.</description>

      <title>Clustering with minimum spanning trees: How good can it be?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimum spanning trees (MSTs) provide a convenient representation of datasets in numerous pattern recognition activities. Moreover, they are relatively fast to compute. In this paper, we quantify the extent to which they are meaningful in low-dimensional partitional data clustering tasks. By identifying the upper bounds for the agreement between the best (oracle) algorithm and the expert labels from a large battery of benchmark data, we discover that MST methods can be very competitive. Next, we review, study, extend, and generalise a few existing, state-of-the-art MST-based partitioning schemes. This leads to some new noteworthy approaches. Overall, the Genie and the information-theoretic methods often outperform the non-MST algorithms such as K-means, Gaussian mixtures, spectral clustering, Birch, density-based, and classical hierarchical agglomerative procedures. Nevertheless, we identify that there is still some room for improvement, and thus the development of novel algorithms is encouraged.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein approximation schemes based on Voronoi partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider structured approximation of measures in Wasserstein space $\mathrm{W}_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $p\in[1,\infty)$ using general measure approximants compactly supported on Voronoi regions derived from a scaled Voronoi partition of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that if a full rank lattice $\Lambda$ is scaled by a factor of $h\in(0,1]$, then approximation of a measure based on the Voronoi partition of $h\Lambda$ is $O(h)$ regardless of $d$ or $p$. We then use a covering argument to show that $N$-term approximations of compactly supported measures is $O(N^{-\frac1d})$ which matches known rates for optimal quantizers and empirical measure approximation in most instances. Additionally, we generalize our construction to nonuniform Voronoi partitions, highlighting the flexibility and robustness of our approach for various measure approximation scenarios. Finally, we extend these results to noncompactly supported measures with sufficient decay. Our findings are pertinent to applications in computer vision and machine learning where measures are used to represent structured data such as images.</description>

      <title>No Free Prune: Information-Theoretic Barriers to Pruning at Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of "lottery tickets" arXiv:1803.03635 at or near initialization raises the tantalizing question of whether large models are necessary in deep learning, or whether sparse networks can be quickly identified and trained without ever training the dense models that contain them. However, efforts to find these sparse subnetworks without training the dense model ("pruning at initialization") have been broadly unsuccessful arXiv:2009.08576. We put forward a theoretical explanation for this, based on the model's effective parameter count, $p_\text{eff}$, given by the sum of the number of non-zero weights in the final network and the mutual information between the sparsity mask and the data. We show the Law of Robustness of arXiv:2105.12806 extends to sparse networks with the usual parameter count replaced by $p_\text{eff}$, meaning a sparse neural network which robustly interpolates noisy data requires a heavily data-dependent mask. We posit that pruning during and after training outputs masks with higher mutual information than those produced by pruning at initialization. Thus two networks may have the same sparsities, but differ in effective parameter count based on how they were trained. This suggests that pruning near initialization may be infeasible and explains why lottery tickets exist, but cannot be found fast (i.e. without training the full network). Experiments on neural networks confirm that information gained during training may indeed affect model capacity.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal.To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems.The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Kernel Stein Discrepancy</title>

Abstract: Kernel methods underpin many of the most successful approaches in data science and statistics, and they allow representing probability measures as elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space without loss of information. Recently, the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which combines Stein's method with kernel techniques, gained considerable attention. Through the Stein operator, KSD allows the construction of powerful goodness-of-fit tests where it is sufficient to know the target distribution up to a multiplicative constant. However, the typical U- and V-statistic-based KSD estimators suffer from a quadratic runtime complexity, which hinders their application in large-scale settings. In this work, we propose a Nystr\"om-based KSD acceleration -- with runtime $\mathcal O\!\left(mn+m^3\right)$ for $n$ samples and $m\ll n$ Nystr\"om points -- , show its $\sqrt{n}$-consistency under the null with a classical sub-Gaussian assumption, and demonstrate its applicability for goodness-of-fit testing on a suite of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Statistical Batch-Based Bearing Fault Detection</title>

Abstract: In the domain of rotating machinery, bearings are vulnerable to different mechanical faults, including ball, inner, and outer race faults. Various techniques can be used in condition-based monitoring, from classical signal analysis to deep learning methods. Based on the complex working conditions of rotary machines, multivariate statistical process control charts such as Hotelling's $T^2$ and Squared Prediction Error are useful for providing early warnings. However, these methods are rarely applied to condition monitoring of rotating machinery due to the univariate nature of the datasets. In the present paper, we propose a multivariate statistical process control-based fault detection method that utilizes multivariate data composed of Fourier transform features extracted for fixed-time batches. Our approach makes use of the multidimensional nature of Fourier transform characteristics, which record more detailed information about the machine's status, in an effort to enhance early defect detection and diagnosis. Experiments with varying vibration measurement locations (Fan End, Drive End), fault types (ball, inner, and outer race faults), and motor loads (0-3 horsepower) are used to validate the suggested approach. The outcomes illustrate our method's effectiveness in fault detection and point to possible broader uses in industrial maintenance.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Modelling in Practice: Using Uncertainty to Improve Trustworthiness in Medical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.08619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a hospital department where machine learning has the potential to provide valuable assistance in clinical decision making. Classical machine learning models usually only provide point-estimates and no uncertainty of predictions. In practice, uncertain predictions should be presented to doctors with extra care in order to prevent potentially catastrophic treatment decisions. In this work we show how Bayesian modelling and the predictive uncertainty that it provides can be used to mitigate risk of misguided prediction and to detect out-of-domain examples in a medical setting. We derive analytically a bound on the prediction loss with respect to predictive uncertainty. The bound shows that uncertainty can mitigate loss. Furthermore, we apply a Bayesian Neural Network to the MIMIC-III dataset, predicting risk of mortality of ICU patients. Our empirical results show that uncertainty can indeed prevent potential errors and reliably identifies out-of-domain patients. These results suggest that Bayesian predictive uncertainty can greatly improve trustworthiness of machine learning models in high-risk settings such as the ICU.</description>

      <title>A Non-Expert's Introduction to Data Ethics for Mathematicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07794v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I give a short introduction to data ethics. I begin with some background information and societal context for data ethics. I then discuss data ethics in mathematical-science education and indicate some available course material. I briefly highlight a few efforts -- at my home institution and elsewhere -- on data ethics, society, and social good. I then discuss open data in research, research replicability and some other ethical issues in research, and the tension between privacy and open data and code, and a few controversial studies and reactions to studies. I then discuss ethical principles, institutional review boards, and a few other considerations in the scientific use of human data. I then briefly survey a variety of research and lay articles that are relevant to data ethics and data privacy. I conclude with a brief summary and some closing remarks.
  My focal audience is mathematicians, but I hope that this chapter will also be useful to others. I am not an expert about data ethics, and this chapter provides only a starting point on this wide-ranging topic. I encourage you to examine the resources that I discuss and to reflect carefully on data ethics, its role in mathematics education, and the societal implications of data and data analysis. As data and technology continue to evolve, I hope that such careful reflection will continue throughout your life.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric extensions of randomized response for private confidence sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.08728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work derives methods for performing nonparametric, nonasymptotic statistical inference for population means under the constraint of local differential privacy (LDP). Given bounded observations $(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ with mean $\mu^\star$ that are privatized into $(Z_1, \dots, Z_n)$, we present confidence intervals (CI) and time-uniform confidence sequences (CS) for $\mu^\star$ when only given access to the privatized data. To achieve this, we study a nonparametric and sequentially interactive generalization of Warner's famous ``randomized response'' mechanism, satisfying LDP for arbitrary bounded random variables, and then provide CIs and CSs for their means given access to the resulting privatized observations. For example, our results yield private analogues of Hoeffding's inequality in both fixed-time and time-uniform regimes. We extend these Hoeffding-type CSs to capture time-varying (non-stationary) means, and conclude by illustrating how these methods can be used to conduct private online A/B tests.</description>

      <title>Normalised clustering accuracy: An asymmetric external cluster validity measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is no, nor will there ever be, single best clustering algorithm. Nevertheless, we would still like to be able to distinguish between methods that work well on certain task types and those that systematically underperform. Clustering algorithms are traditionally evaluated using either internal or external validity measures. Internal measures quantify different aspects of the obtained partitions, e.g., the average degree of cluster compactness or point separability. However, their validity is questionable because the clusterings they endorse can sometimes be meaningless. External measures, on the other hand, compare the algorithms' outputs to fixed ground truth groupings provided by experts. In this paper, we argue that the commonly used classical partition similarity scores, such as the normalised mutual information, Fowlkes-Mallows, or adjusted Rand index, miss some desirable properties. In particular, they do not identify worst-case scenarios correctly, nor are they easily interpretable. As a consequence, the evaluation of clustering algorithms on diverse benchmark datasets can be difficult. To remedy these issues, we propose and analyse a new measure: a version of the optimal set-matching accuracy, which is normalised, monotonic with respect to some similarity relation, scale-invariant, and corrected for the imbalancedness of cluster sizes (but neither symmetric nor adjusted for chance).</description>

      <title>One-shot Generative Distribution Matching for Augmented RF-based UAV Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08403v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of identifying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) using radiofrequency (RF) fingerprinting in limited RF environments. The complexity and variability of RF signals, influenced by environmental interference and hardware imperfections, often render traditional RF-based identification methods ineffective. To address these complications, the study introduces the rigorous use of one-shot generative methods for augmenting transformed RF signals, offering a significant improvement in UAV identification. This approach shows promise in low-data regimes, outperforming deep generative methods like conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs). The paper provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of one-shot generative models in augmenting limited data, setting a precedent for their application in limited RF environments. This research contributes to learning techniques in low-data regime scenarios, which may include atypical complex sequences beyond images and videos. The code and links to datasets used in this study are available at https://github.com/amir-kazemi/uav-rf-id.</description>

      <title>The most likely common cause</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The common cause principle for two random variables $A$ and $B$ is examined in the case of causal insufficiency, when their common cause $C$ is known to exist, but only the joint probability of $A$ and $B$ is observed. As a result, $C$ cannot be uniquely identified (the latent confounder problem). We show that the generalized maximum likelihood method can be applied to this situation and allows identification of $C$ that is consistent with the common cause principle. It closely relates to the maximum entropy principle. Investigation of the two binary symmetric variables reveals a non-analytic behavior of conditional probabilities reminiscent of a second-order phase transition. This occurs during the transition from correlation to anti-correlation in the observed probability distribution. The relation between the generalized likelihood approach and alternative methods, such as predictive likelihood and the minimum common cause entropy, is discussed. The consideration of the common cause for three observed variables (and one hidden cause) uncovers causal structures that defy representation through directed acyclic graphs with the Markov condition.</description>

      <title>Generative Learning of Continuous Data by Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond their origin in modeling many-body quantum systems, tensor networks have emerged as a promising class of models for solving machine learning problems, notably in unsupervised generative learning. While possessing many desirable features arising from their quantum-inspired nature, tensor network generative models have previously been largely restricted to binary or categorical data, limiting their utility in real-world modeling problems. We overcome this by introducing a new family of tensor network generative models for continuous data, which are capable of learning from distributions containing continuous random variables. We develop our method in the setting of matrix product states, first deriving a universal expressivity theorem proving the ability of this model family to approximate any reasonably smooth probability density function with arbitrary precision. We then benchmark the performance of this model on several synthetic and real-world datasets, finding that the model learns and generalizes well on distributions of continuous and discrete variables. We develop methods for modeling different data domains, and introduce a trainable compression layer which is found to increase model performance given limited memory or computational resources. Overall, our methods give important theoretical and empirical evidence of the efficacy of quantum-inspired methods for the rapidly growing field of generative learning.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Outlier Detection using Random Subspace and Subsampling Ensembles of Dirichlet Process Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic mixture models are recognized as effective tools for unsupervised outlier detection owing to their interpretability and global characteristics. Among these, Dirichlet process mixture models stand out as a strong alternative to conventional finite mixture models for both clustering and outlier detection tasks. Unlike finite mixture models, Dirichlet process mixtures are infinite mixture models that automatically determine the number of mixture components based on the data. Despite their advantages, the adoption of Dirichlet process mixture models for unsupervised outlier detection has been limited by challenges related to computational inefficiency and sensitivity to outliers in the construction of outlier detectors. Additionally, Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures struggle to effectively model non-Gaussian data with discrete or binary features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel outlier detection method that utilizes ensembles of Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures. This unsupervised algorithm employs random subspace and subsampling ensembles to ensure efficient computation and improve the robustness of the outlier detector. The ensemble approach further improves the suitability of the proposed method for detecting outliers in non-Gaussian data. Furthermore, our method uses variational inference for Dirichlet process mixtures, which ensures both efficient and rapid computation. Empirical analyses using benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in unsupervised outlier detection.</description>

Abstract: Many aspects of graphs have been studied in depth. However, forecasting the structure of a graph at future time steps incorporating unseen, new nodes and edges has not gained much attention. In this paper, we present such an approach. Using a time series of graphs, we forecast graphs at future time steps. We use time series forecasting methods to predict the node degree at future time points and combine these forecasts with flux balance analysis -- a linear programming method used in biochemistry -- to obtain the structure of future graphs. We evaluate this approach using synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate its utility and applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the QuadratiK package that incorporates innovative data analysis methodologies. The presented software, implemented in both R and Python, offers a comprehensive set of goodness-of-fit tests and clustering techniques using kernel-based quadratic distances, thereby bridging the gap between the statistical and machine learning literatures. Our software implements one, two and k-sample tests for goodness of fit, providing an efficient and mathematically sound way to assess the fit of probability distributions. Expanded capabilities of our software include supporting tests for uniformity on the d-dimensional Sphere based on Poisson kernel densities. Particularly noteworthy is the incorporation of a unique clustering algorithm specifically tailored for spherical data that leverages a mixture of Poisson kernel-based densities on the sphere. Alongside this, our software includes additional graphical functions, aiding the users in validating, as well as visualizing and representing clustering results. This enhances interpretability and usability of the analysis. In summary, our R and Python packages serve as a powerful suite of tools, offering researchers and practitioners the means to delve deeper into their data, draw robust inference, and conduct potentially impactful analyses and inference across a wide array of disciplines.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a principled approach to molecular design tasks. In this paper we explain three pitfalls of BO which can cause poor empirical performance: an incorrect prior width, over-smoothing, and inadequate acquisition function maximization. We show that with these issues addressed, even a basic BO setup is able to achieve the highest overall performance on the PMO benchmark for molecule design (Gao et al 2022). These results suggest that BO may benefit from more attention in the machine learning for molecules community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>

      <title>A unified theory and statistical learning approach for traffic conflict detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a unified theory and statistical learning approach for traffic conflict detection, addressing the long-existing call for a consistent and comprehensive methodology to evaluate the collision risk emerging in road user interactions. The proposed theory assumes context-dependent probabilistic collision risk and frames conflict detection as assessing this risk by statistical learning of extreme events in daily interactions. Experiments using real-world trajectory data are conducted in this study, where a unified metric of conflict is trained with lane-changing interactions on German highways and applied to near-crash events from the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study in the U.S. Results of the experiments demonstrate that the trained metric provides effective collision warnings, generalises across distinct datasets and traffic environments, covers a broad range of conflicts, and delivers a long-tailed distribution of conflict intensity. Reflecting on these results, the unified theory ensures consistent evaluation by a generic formulation that encompasses varying assumptions of traffic conflicts; the statistical learning approach then enables a comprehensive consideration of influencing factors such as motion states of road users, environment conditions, and participant characteristics. Therefore, the theory and learning approach jointly provide an explainable and adaptable methodology for conflict detection among different road users and across various interaction scenarios. This promises to reduce accidents and improve overall traffic safety, by enhanced safety assessment of traffic infrastructures, more effective collision warning systems for autonomous driving, and a deeper understanding of road user behaviour in different traffic conditions.</description>

Abstract: What happens if we train a new Large Language Model (LLM) using data that are at least partially generated by other LLMs? The explosive success of LLMs means that a substantial amount of content online will be generated by LLMs rather than humans, which will inevitably enter the training datasets of next-generation LLMs. We evaluate the implications of such "regurgitative training" on LLM performance. Through fine-tuning GPT-3.5 with data generated either by itself or by other LLMs in a machine translation task, we find strong evidence that regurgitative training clearly handicaps the performance of LLMs. The same performance loss of regurgitative training is observed on transformer models that we train from scratch. We find suggestive evidence that the performance disadvantage of regurgitative training can be attributed to at least two mechanisms: (1) higher error rates and (2) lower lexical diversity in LLM-generated data as compared to real data. Based on these mechanisms, we propose and evaluate three different strategies to mitigate the performance loss of regurgitative training. First, we devise data-driven metrics to gauge the quality of each LLM-generated data instance, and then carry out an ordered training process where high-quality data are added before low-quality ones. Second, we combine data generated by multiple different LLMs (as an attempt to increase lexical diversity). Third, we train an AI detection classifier to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated data, and include LLM-generated data in the order of resemblance to human-generated data. All three strategies can improve the performance of regurgitative training to some extent but are not always able to fully close the gap from training with real data. Our results highlight the value of real, human-generated data in training LLMs, which cannot be easily substituted by synthetic, LLM-generated data.</description>
