      <title>Analysis of Uncertainty in Procedural Maps in Slay the Spire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the role of uncertainty in Slay the Spire using an information-theoretic framework. Focusing on the entropy of game paths (which are based on procedurally-generated maps) we analyze how randomness influences player decision-making and success. By examining a dataset of 20,000 game runs, we quantify the entropy of paths taken by players and relate it with their outcomes and skill levels. The results show that victorious runs are associated with higher normalized entropy, suggesting more risk-taking. Additionally, higher-skill players tend to exhibit distinct patterns of risk-taking behavior in later game stages.</description>

      <title>Grant-Free Random Access in Uplink LEO Satellite Communications with OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint device activity detection and channel estimation for grant-free random access in Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications. We consider uplink communications from multiple single-antenna terrestrial users to a LEO satellite equipped with a uniform planar array of multiple antennas, where orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is adopted. To combat the severe Doppler shift, a transmission scheme is proposed, where the discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM) is introduced to reduce the number of unknown channel parameters. Then the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm is employed to approximate the minimum mean square error estimation of the channel, and the Markov random field is combined to capture the channel sparsity. Meanwhile, the expectation-maximization (EM) approach is integrated to learn the hyperparameters in priors. Finally, active devices are detected by calculating energy of the estimated channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of activity error rate and channel estimation precision.</description>

      <title>Feature Importance-Aware Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Computationally Efficient and Adjustable Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) have significantly improved communication performance, but their high computational demands restrict practical deployment. Furthermore, some applications require the adaptive adjustment of computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient and adjustable deepJSCC model for image transmission, which we call feature importance-aware deepJSCC (FAJSCC). Unlike existing deepJSCC models that equally process all neural features of images, FAJSCC first classifies features into important and less important features and then processes them differently. Specifically, computationally-intensive self-attention is applied to the important features and computationally-efficient spatial attention to the less important ones. The feature classification is based on the available computational budget and importance scores predicted by an importance predictor, which estimates each feature's contribution to performance. It also allows independent adjustment of encoder and decoder complexity within a single trained model. With these properties, our FAJSCC is the first deepJSCC that is computationally efficient and adjustable while maintaining high performance. Experiments demonstrate that our FAJSCC achieves higher image transmission performance across various channel conditions while using less computational complexity than the recent state-of-the-art models. Adding to this, by separately varying the computational resources of the encoder and decoder, it is concluded that the decoder's error correction function requires the largest computational complexity in FAJSCC, which is the first observation in deepJSCC literature. The FAJSCC code is publicly available at https://github.com/hansung-choi/FAJSCC.</description>

      <title>Cellular Network Design for UAV Corridors via Data-driven High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of designing cellular networks for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) corridors through a novel data-driven approach. We assess multiple state-of-the-art high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO) techniques to jointly optimize the cell antenna tilts and half-power beamwidth (HPBW). We find that some of these approaches achieve over 20dB gains in median SINR along UAV corridors, with negligible degradation to ground user performance. Furthermore, we explore the HD-BO's capabilities in terms of model generalization via transfer learning, where data from a previously observed scenario source is leveraged to predict the optimal solution for a new scenario target. We provide examples of scenarios where such transfer learning is successful and others where it fails. Moreover, we demonstrate that HD-BO enables multi-objective optimization, identifying optimal design trade-offs between data rates on the ground versus UAV coverage reliability. We observe that aiming to provide UAV coverage across the entire sky can lower the rates for ground users compared to setups specifically optimized for UAV corridors. Finally, we validate our approach through a case study in a real-world cellular network, where HD-BO identifies optimal and non-obvious antenna configurations that result in more than double the rates along 3D UAV corridors with negligible ground performance loss.</description>

      <title>Robust Blind Channel Estimation for Bursty Impulsive Noise with a Constrained EM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impulsive noise (IN) commonly generated by power devices can severely degrade the performance of high sensitivity wireless receivers. Accurate channel state information (CSI) knowledge is essential for designing optimal maximum a posteriori detectors. This paper examines blind channel estimation methods based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm tailored for scenarios impacted by bursty IN, which can be described by the Markov-Middleton model. We propose a constrained EM algorithm that exploits the trellis structure of the IN model and the transmitted binary phase shift keying (BPSK) symbols. By enforcing shared variance among specific trellis states and symmetry in the transition matrix, the proposed constrained EM algorithm adapted for the bursty IN channel has an almost two times faster convergence rate and better estimation performance than the standard EM approach. We comprehensively evaluate the robustness of both standard and constrained EM estimators under different types of CSI uncertainties. The results indicate that the final estimations of both EM estimators are robust enough to mismatch Markov-Middleton model parameters. However, as the level of CSI uncertainty increases, the convergence rate decreases.</description>

      <title>Learning to Interfere in Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multiple transmitters aiming to communicate their source signals (e.g., images) over a multiple access channel (MAC). Conventional communication systems minimize interference by orthogonally allocating resources (time and/or bandwidth) among users, which limits their capacity. We introduce a machine learning (ML)-aided wireless image transmission method that merges compression and channel coding using a multi-view autoencoder, which allows the transmitters to use all the available channel resources simultaneously, resulting in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. The receiver must recover all the images from the received superposed signal, while also associating each image with its transmitter. Traditional ML models deal with individual samples, whereas our model allows signals from different users to interfere in order to leverage gains from NOMA under limited bandwidth and power constraints. We introduce a progressive fine-tuning algorithm that doubles the number of users at each iteration, maintaining initial performance with orthogonalized user-specific projections, which is then improved through fine-tuning steps. Remarkably, our method scales up to 16 users and beyond, with only a 0.6% increase in the number of trainable parameters compared to a single-user model, significantly enhancing recovered image quality and outperforming existing NOMA-based methods over a wide range of datasets, metrics, and channel conditions. Our approach paves the way for more efficient and robust multi-user communication systems, leveraging innovative ML components and strategies.</description>

      <title>Matrix Chernoff concentration bounds for multipartite soft covering and expander walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Chernoff style exponential concentration bounds for classical quantum soft covering generalising previous works which gave bounds only in expectation. Our first result is an exponential concentration bound for fully smooth multipartite classical quantum soft covering, extending Ahlswede-Winter's seminal result in several important directions. Next, we prove a new exponential concentration result for smooth unipartite classical quantum soft covering when the samples are taken via a random walk on an expander graph. The resulting expander matrix Chernoff bound complements the results of Garg, Lee, Song and Srivastava in important ways. We prove our new expander matrix Chernoff bound by generalising McDiarmid's method of bounded differences for functions of independent random variables to a new method of bounded excision for functions of expander walks. This new technical tool should be of independent interest.
  A notable feature of our new concentration bounds is that they have no explicit Hilbert space dimension factor. This is because our bounds are stated in terms of the trace distance of the sample averaged quantum state to the `ideal' quantum state. Our bounds are sensitive to certain smooth Renyi max divergences, giving a clear handle on the number of samples required to achieve a target trace distance. Using these novel features, we prove new one shot inner bounds for sending private classical information over different kinds of quantum wiretap channels with many non-interacting eavesdroppers that are independent of the Hilbert space dimensions of the eavesdroppers. Such powerful results were unknown earlier even in the fully classical setting.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Uplink and Downlink Power in Full-Duplex Integrated Access and Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the performance of an Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) node as a range extender for beyond-5G networks, focusing on the significant challenges of effective power allocation and beamforming strategies, which are vital for maximizing users' spectral efficiency (SE). We present both max-sum SE and max-min fairness power allocation strategies, to assess their effects on system performance. The results underscore the necessity of power optimization, particularly as the number of users served by the IAB node increases, demonstrating how efficient power allocation enhances service quality in high-load scenarios. The results also show that the typical line-of-sight link between the IAB donor and the IAB node has rank one, posing a limitation on the effective SEs that the IAB node can support.</description>

      <title>Efficient Rejection Sampling in the Entropy-Optimal Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of generating a random variate $X$ from a finite discrete probability distribution $P$ using an entropy source of independent unbiased coin flips is considered. The Knuth and Yao complexity theory of nonuniform random number generation furnishes a family of "entropy-optimal" sampling algorithms that consume between $H(P)$ and $H(P)+2$ coin flips per generated output, where $H$ is the Shannon entropy function. However, the space complexity of entropy-optimal samplers scales exponentially with the number of bits required to encode $P$. This article introduces a family of efficient rejection samplers and characterizes their entropy, space, and time complexity. Within this family is a distinguished sampling algorithm that requires linearithmic space and preprocessing time, and whose expected entropy cost always falls in the entropy-optimal range $[H(P), H(P)+2)$. No previous sampler for discrete probability distributions is known to achieve these characteristics. Numerical experiments demonstrate performance improvements in runtime and entropy of the proposed algorithm compared to the celebrated alias method.</description>

Abstract: We study Bregman divergences in probability density space embedded with the $L^2$-Wasserstein metric. Several properties and dualities of transport Bregman divergences are provided. In particular, we derive the transport Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence by a Bregman divergence of negative Boltzmann-Shannon entropy in $L^2$-Wasserstein space. We also derive analytical formulas and generalizations of transport KL divergence for one-dimensional probability densities and Gaussian families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sequential probability assignment in the Gaussian setting, where the goal is to predict, or equivalently compress, a sequence of real-valued observations almost as well as the best Gaussian distribution with mean constrained to a given subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. First, in the case of a convex constraint set $K$, we express the hardness of the prediction problem (the minimax regret) in terms of the intrinsic volumes of $K$; specifically, it equals the logarithm of the Wills functional from convex geometry. We then establish a comparison inequality for the Wills functional in the general nonconvex case, which underlines the metric nature of this quantity and generalizes the Slepian-Sudakov-Fernique comparison principle for the Gaussian width. Motivated by this inequality, we characterize the exact order of magnitude of the considered functional for a general nonconvex set, in terms of global covering numbers and local Gaussian widths. This implies sharp estimates, of metric nature, on the log-Laplace transform of the intrinsic volume sequence of a convex body. As part of our analysis, we also characterize the minimax redundancy for a general constraint set. We finally relate and contrast our findings with classical asymptotic results in information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) wireless communication system will improve the key technical indicators by one to two orders of magnitude, and come with some new features. As a crucial technique to enhance the reliability and efficiency of data transmission, the next-generation channel coding is thus confronted with new challenges in terms of complexity, latency, performance. This article supplies an overview of the potential channel codes for 6G communications. In addition, we explore to develop next-generation channel codes based on lowdensity parity-check (LDPC) and polar frameworks, introducing a concept named generalized LDPC with polar-like component(GLDPC-PC) codes. The codes have exhibited promising error correction performance and manageable complexity, which can be further optimized by specific code design. The opportunities and challenges of GLDPC-PC codes are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On predictors and filters for non-decaying unbounded continuous time signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies spectral representation and its applications for non-decaying
  continuous time signals
  that are not necessarily bounded at $\pm\infty$. The paper introduces notions of transfer functions, spectrum degeneracy, spectrum gaps,
  and bandlimitness, for these unbounded signals. As an example of applications, explicit formulae are given for transfer functions of low-pass and high-pass
  filters suitable for these signal. As another example of applications, it is shown that
  non-decaying unbounded signals with a single point spectrum degeneracy and sublinear rate of growth are predictable.
  The corresponding transfer functions for the predictors are obtained explicitly.</description>

      <title>On the Coverage Required for Diploid Genome Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The repeat content and heterozygosity rate of a target genome are important factors in determining the feasibility of achieving a complete telomere-to-telomere assembly. The mathematical relationship between the required coverage and read length for the purpose of unique reconstruction remains unexplored for diploid genomes. We investigate the information-theoretic conditions that the given set of sequencing reads must satisfy to achieve the complete reconstruction of the true sequence of a diploid genome. We also analyze the standard greedy and de-Bruijn graph-based assembly algorithms. Our results show that the coverage and read length requirements of the assembly algorithms are considerably higher than the lower bound because both algorithms require the double repeats in the genome to be bridged. Finally, we derive the necessary conditions for the overlap graph-based assembly paradigm.</description>

      <title>The Empirical Spectral Distribution of i.i.d. Random Matrices with Random Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a $d\times d$ random matrix $\mathbf{M} :=\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\mathbf{W}+\mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Lambda}\mathbf{U}^*$, where the entries of $\mathbf{W}$ are i.i.d.\ complex variables with zero mean, unit variance, and finite fourth moment; $\mathbf{\Lambda}=\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_r)$ is a diagonal matrix with $\lambda_1\ge\lambda_2\ge \ldots\ge \lambda_r&gt;1$ and $\mathbf{U}$ is uniformly drawn from the Stiefel manifold $\operatorname{Stief}(d,r)$ or its complex counterpart $\operatorname{Stief}_\mathbb{C}(d,r)$. We propose three results: (i) We show that the top $r$ eigenvalues of $\mathbf{M}$ concentrate around $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_r$, respectively, and the magnitude of the $(r{+}1)$-th eigenvalue concentrates around $1$. (ii) For the case $r=1$ (i.e., $\mathbf{M}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\mathbf{W}+\lambda\mathbf{u}\mathbf{u}^*$), we prove that the top eigenvector (namely $\mathbf{v}_1(\mathbf{M})$) aligns with $\mathbf{u}$ in the sense that $\left|\langle\mathbf{v}_1(\mathbf{M}), \mathbf{u}\rangle\right|$ converges to a limit which depends on $\lambda$ (in probability). (iii) In applications, we present the first optimal \textit{query complexity} lower bound for approximating the top eigenvector of asymmetric matrices. We show that for every $\operatorname{gap}=\frac{\lambda-1}{\lambda}\in (0,1/2]$, then $\operatorname{gap}(\mathbf{M})=\Omega(\operatorname{gap})$ with high probability, and if a matrix-vector product algorithm can identify a vector $\hat{\mathbf{v}}$ which satisfies $\left\|\hat{\mathbf{v}}-\mathbf{v}_1(\mathbf{M}) \right\|_2^2\le \operatorname{const}\times \operatorname{gap}$, it needs at least $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log d}{\operatorname{gap}}\right)$ queries of matrix-vector products.</description>

      <title>Evaluating 5G Networks for U-Space Applications: Insights from Dense Urban Measurement Campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the burgeoning interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) utilization within human-inhabited spaces, critical challenges arise in ensuring reliable, low-latency communication-particularly important given the safety-critical nature of such operations in densely populated urban environments. Therefore, adequate cellular communication capabilities are essential to enable safe and effective operations within the so-called U-Spaces. In this context, this paper investigates the communication performance of cellular-connected UAVs in dense urban environments. In particular, the analysis is based on a comprehensive measurement campaign conducted in the city of Benidorm, Spain-an urban area well known for its high concentration of tall buildings and overall urban density. More specifically, we evaluated key performance indicators (KPIs) related to received signal strength and quality, data rate, and latency across various altitudes, mobile network operators, access technologies, and frequency bands, using multiple types of measurement equipment. The results highlight significant challenges, primarily due to the lack of dedicated planning for aerial coverage and interference management, revealing that current cellular networks may fall short in supporting reliable and ubiquitous UAVs communication. Thus, this paper calls for improved network solutions to ensure the reliability of UAV operations in urban airspace, thereby contributing to the integration of UAVs into urban logistics and mobility.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Source Channel Coding for Privacy-Aware End-to-End Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based joint source and channel coding is proposed for privacy-aware end-to-end image transmission against multiple eavesdroppers. Both scenarios of colluding and non-colluding eavesdroppers are considered. Unlike prior works that assume perfectly known and independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) source and channel statistics, the proposed scheme operates under unknown and non-i.i.d. conditions, making it more applicable to real-world scenarios. The goal is to transmit images with minimum distortion, while simultaneously preventing eavesdroppers from inferring certain private attributes of images. Simultaneously generalizing the ideas of privacy funnel and wiretap coding, a multi-objective optimization framework is expressed that characterizes the tradeoff between image reconstruction quality and information leakage to eavesdroppers, taking into account the structural similarity index (SSIM) for improving the perceptual quality of image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA, along with ablation studies, demonstrate significant performance improvements in terms of SSIM, adversarial accuracy, and the mutual information leakage compared to benchmarks. Experiments show that the proposed scheme restrains the adversarially-trained eavesdroppers from intercepting privatized data for both cases of eavesdropping a common secret, as well as the case in which eavesdroppers are interested in different secrets. Furthermore, useful insights on the privacy-utility trade-off are also provided.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna Enhanced Wireless Networks: Synergizing Positionable and Rotatable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a new
  and revolutionary technique that fully exploits the wireless
  channel spatial variations at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly
  adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and/or 3D rotations
  of antennas/antenna surfaces (sub-arrays), thereby improving the performance of wireless
  networks cost-effectively without the need to deploy additional
  antennas. It is thus expected that
  the integration of new 6DMAs into future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will fundamentally enhance
  antenna agility and adaptability, and introduce new degrees
  of freedom (DoFs) for system design. Despite its great potential,
  6DMA faces new challenges to be efficiently implemented in wireless
  networks, including corresponding architectures, antenna position and rotation optimization, channel estimation,
  and system design from both communication and sensing perspectives. In
  this paper, we provide a tutorial on 6DMA-enhanced wireless
  networks to address the above issues by unveiling associated new channel models, hardware implementations and
  practical position/rotation constraints, as well as various appealing applications in
  wireless networks. Moreover, we discuss two special cases of 6DMA, namely, rotatable 6DMA with fixed antenna position and positionable 6DMA with fixed antenna rotation, and highlight their respective design challenges and applications.
  We further present prototypes developed for 6DMA-enhanced communication along with experimental results obtained with these prototypes. Finally, we outline promising directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Limits to Analog Reservoir Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Federated Learning Approach for the Internet of Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel federated learning solution, QHetFed, suitable for large-scale Internet of Things deployments, addressing the challenges of large geographic span, communication resource limitation, and data heterogeneity. QHetFed is based on hierarchical federated learning over multiple device sets, where the learning process and learning parameters take the necessary data quantization and the data heterogeneity into consideration to achieve high accuracy and fast convergence. Unlike conventional hierarchical federated learning algorithms, the proposed approach combines gradient aggregation in intra-set iterations with model aggregation in inter-set iterations. We offer a comprehensive analytical framework to evaluate its optimality gap and convergence rate, and give a closed form expression for the optimal learning parameters under a deadline, that accounts for communication and computation times. Our findings reveal that QHetFed consistently achieves high learning accuracy and significantly outperforms other hierarchical algorithms, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <title>On the best approximation by finite Gaussian mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a general Gaussian location mixture by finite mixtures. The minimum order of finite mixtures that achieve a prescribed accuracy (measured by various $f$-divergences) is determined within constant factors for the family of mixing distributions with compactly support or appropriate assumptions on the tail probability including subgaussian and subexponential. While the upper bound is achieved using the technique of local moment matching, the lower bound is established by relating the best approximation error to the low-rank approximation of certain trigonometric moment matrices, followed by a refined spectral analysis of their minimum eigenvalue. In the case of Gaussian mixing distributions, this result corrects a previous lower bound in [Allerton Conference 48 (2010) 620-628].</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air DPD and Reciprocity Calibration in Massive MIMO and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study an over-the-air (OTA) approach for digital pre-distortion (DPD) and reciprocity calibration in massive multiple-input-multiple-output systems. In particular, we consider a memory-less non-linearity model for the base station (BS) transmitters and propose a methodology to linearize the transmitters and perform the calibration by using mutual coupling OTA measurements between BS antennas. We show that by only using the OTA-based data, we can linearize the transmitters and design the calibration to compensate for both the non-linearity and non-reciprocity of BS transceivers effectively. This allows to alleviate the requirement to have dedicated hardware modules for transceiver characterization. Moreover, exploiting the results of the DPD linearization step, our calibration method may be formulated in terms of closed-form transformations, achieving a significant complexity reduction over state-of-the-art methods, which usually rely on costly iterative computations. Simulation results showcase the potential of our approach in terms of the calibration matrix estimation error and downlink data-rates when applying zero-forcing precoding after using our OTA-based DPD and calibration method.</description>

      <title>Large Intelligent Surfaces with Low-End Receivers: From Scaling to Antenna and Panel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of large intelligent surface (LIS) with hardware distortion at its RX-chains. In particular, we consider the memory-less polynomial model for non-ideal hardware and derive analytical expressions for the signal to noise plus distortion ratio after applying maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the LIS. We also study the effect of back-off and automatic gain control on the RX-chains. The derived expressions enable us to evaluate the scalability of LIS when hardware impairments are present. We also study the cost of assuming ideal hardware by analyzing the minimum scaling required to achieve the same performance with a non-ideal hardware. Then, we exploit the analytical expressions to propose optimized antenna selection schemes for LIS and we show that such schemes can improve the performance significantly. In particular, the antenna selection schemes allow the LIS to have lower number of non-ideal RX-chains for signal reception while maintaining a good performance. We also consider a more practical case where the LIS is deployed as a grid of multi-antenna panels, and we propose panel selection schemes to optimize the complexity-performance trade-offs and improve the system overall efficiency.</description>

      <title>Empirical Coordination of Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. This makes empirical coordination a natural and operationally meaningful framework for quantum systems - particularly in the context of nonlocal games, which rely on repeated measurements to assess performance. We begin by analyzing networks with classical links, focusing on the cascade network. For this setting, we establish the optimal coordination rates, which indicate the minimal resources required to simulate a quantum state on average. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination.
  Our analysis starts with a basic two-node scenario and extends to cascade networks, including the special case of a network with an isolated node. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition.
  We then extend the framework to networks with quantum links, focusing on a broadcast setting where the receivers have side information. Finally, we discuss how our results provide new insights into the implementation and simulation of quantum nonlocal games in the empirical regime.</description>
