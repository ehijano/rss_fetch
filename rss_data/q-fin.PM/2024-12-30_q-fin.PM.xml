      <title>Robust and Sparse Portfolio Selection: Quantitative Insights and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical mean-variance (MV) framework and propose a robust and sparse portfolio selection model incorporating an ellipsoidal uncertainty set to reduce the impact of estimation errors and fixed transaction costs to penalize over-diversification. In the literature, the MV model under fixed transaction costs is referred to as the sparse or cardinality-constrained MV optimization, which is a mixed integer problem and is challenging to solve when the number of assets is large. We develop an efficient semismooth Newton-based proximal difference-of-convex algorithm to solve the proposed model and prove its convergence to at least a local minimizer with a locally linear convergence rate. We explore properties of the robust and sparse portfolio both analytically and numerically. In particular, we show that the MV optimization is indeed a robust procedure as long as an investor makes the proper choice on the risk-aversion coefficient. We contribute to the literature by proving that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the risk-aversion coefficient and the level of robustness. Moreover, we characterize how the number of traded assets changes with respect to the interaction between the level of uncertainty on model parameters and the magnitude of transaction cost.</description>

      <title>Sentiment trading with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment analysis of U.S. financial news and their potential in predicting stock market returns. We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs, including BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary model, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The study documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent daily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the highest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly ahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1% accuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model scores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in different model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive relevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant relationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock returns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current financial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels with a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT long-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary yield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior performance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction and portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of financial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy analysis.</description>
