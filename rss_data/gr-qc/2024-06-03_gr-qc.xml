      <title>Charged particle geodesics and closed timelike curves in an electromagnetic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinning electromagnetic universe, known also as the Rotating Bertotti-Robinson(RBR) spacetime is considered as a model to represent our cosmos. The model derives from different physical considerations, such as colliding waves, throat region, and near horizon geometry of the Kerr-Newman black hole. Our interest is whether such a singularity-free spinning cosmology gives rise to a natural direction of flow, a 'chirality' for charged particles. Homochiral structures are known to be crucial for biology to start. Our concern here is cosmology rather than biology, but as in biology, the stable structures in cosmology may also rely on homochiral elements. We show the occurrence of closed timelike curves a 'la' G{\"o}del. Such curves, however, seem possible only at localized cell structures, not at large scales, but according to our prescription of near horizon geometry, they arise in the vicinity of any charged, spinning black hole.</description>

      <title>Scattering and dynamical capture of two black holes: synergies between numerical and analytical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study initially unbound systems of two black holes using numerical relativity (NR) simulations performed with GR-Athena++. We focus on regions of the parameter space close to the transition from scatterings to dynamical captures, considering equal mass and spin-aligned configurations, as well as unequal mass and nonspinning ones. The numerical results are then used to validate the effective-one-body (EOB) model TEOBResumS-Dal\'i for dynamical captures and scatterings. We find good agreement for the waveform phenomenologies, scattering angles, mismatches, and energetics in the low energy regime ($E_0\lesssim 1.02\,M$). In particular, mismatches are typically below or around the $1\%$ level, with only a few cases -- corresponding to spinning binaries -- slightly above the $3\%$ threshold. We also discuss dynamical captures in the test-mass limit by solving numerically the Zerilli equation with the time domain code RWZHyp. The latter analysis provides valuable insights into both the analytical noncircular corrections of the EOB waveform and the integration of NR Weyl scalars.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous scalarization in Einstein--power--Maxwell--scalar models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spontaneous scalarization of charged black holes in Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to power--Maxwell electrodynamics which, in turn, is non--minimally coupled to a real scalar field. We point out the existence of a specific power for which the scalarized solution is well-behaved, and entropically preferred in comparison to the scalar-free charged black hole solution.</description>

      <title>Do small massive superpositions necessarily significantly entangle with gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Christodoulou and Rovelli (CR) [1] have argued that a Bose et al.-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment that confirmed the quantum nature of gravity would give laboratory evidence for a quantum superposition of spacetime geometries created in the course of the experiment. Hanif et al. [2] have argued that mass interferometers can be used to test whether gravity acts as a quantum entity when measured. We note that not all quantum models of gravity imply that mass superpositions necessarily become significantly entangled with any degrees of freedom of the gravitational field during the experiments discussed.</description>

      <title>Should we necessarily treat masses as localized when analysing tests of quantum gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently proposed ``table-top tests of quantum gravity'' involve creating, separating and recombining superpositions of masses at non-relativistic speeds. The general expectation is that these generate superpositions of gravitational fields via the Newtonian potential. Analyses suggest that negligible gravitational radiation is generated if the interference experiments involve sufficiently small accelerations. One way of thinking about this is that matter and the static gravitational field are temporarily entangled and then disentangled. Another is that the static gravitational field degrees of freedom are dependent on the matter and do not belong to a separate Hilbert space, and that there is always negligible entanglement between matter and dynamical gravitational degrees of freedom.
  In this last picture, localized masses effectively become infinitely extended objects, inseparable from their Newtonian potentials. While this picture seems hard to extend to a fully relativistic theory of non-quantum gravity, it has significant implications for analyses of how or whether BMV and other non-relativistic experiments might test the quantum nature of gravity. If the masses in a BMV experiment are regarded as occupying overlapping regions (or indeed all of space), explaining how they become entangled does not require that their gravitational interaction involves quantum information exchange. On this view, while the experiments test gravity in a regime where quantum theory describes all relevant matter degrees of freedom, they do not necessarily test its quantum nature. It might be argued that no plausible explanation other than quantum gravity could be consistent both with these experiments and with relativity. But this relies on further theoretical assumptions and is weaker than claiming direct evidence for quantum gravitational interactions from the experiments alone.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian structure and constraint algebra in the (2+2) formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical formalism of the (2+2) formulation of general relativity of 4 spacetime dimensions is studied under no symmetry assumptions, where the spacetime is viewed as a local product of a 2 dimensional base manifold of Lorentzian signature with the vertical space as its complement. The affine null parameter is chosen as the time coordinate whose level surfaces are 3 dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces. From the first-order action principle, Hamilton's equations of motion and the constraints are obtained, which are found to be equivalent to the Einstein's equations. The constraint algebra is also presented, which has interesting subalgebras such as the infinite dimensional Lie algebra of the diffeomorphisms of the 2 dimensional vertical space, infinite dimensional Virasoro algebra associated with the 2 dimensional base manifold, and an analog of supertranslation. The symmetry algebra may be viewed as a generalization of the BMS or Spi group to a finite distance.</description>

      <title>Poisson algebra of quasilocal angular momentum and its asymptotic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the previously proposed quasilocal angular momentum of gravitational fields in the absence of isometries. The quasilocal angular momentum $L(\xi)$ has the following attractive properties; ({\it i}) it follows from the Einstein's constraint equations, ({\it ii}) it satisfies the Poisson algebra $\{L(\xi), L(\eta) \}_{\rm P.B.} =({1/16\pi)}\, L( [\xi, \eta]_{\rm L} )$, ({\it iii}) its Poisson algebra reduces to the standard $SO(3)$ algebra of angular momentum at null infinity, and ({\it iv}) it reproduces the standard value for the Kerr spacetime at null infinity. It will be argued that our definition is a quasilocal and canonical generalization of A. Rizzi's geometric definition at null infinity. We also propose a new definition of an {\it invariant} quasilocal angular momentum $L^{2}$ such that $\{ L^2, L(\xi) \}_{\rm P.B.} = 0$, which becomes $(ma)^{2}$ at the null infinity of the Kerr spacetime. Therefore, it may be regarded as a quasilocal generalization of the Casimir invariant of ordinary angular momentum in the flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Gravity Equivalent to Teleparallelism: Some Basic Geometrical Aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the book of Ruben Aldrovandi and Jose Geraldo Pereira about Teleparallel Gravity. Teleparallel Gravity is an alternative to General Relativity to describe the gravitational interaction. The difference between General Relativity and Teleparallel Gravity is the fact that General Relativity associates the curvature to the gravitational interaction, whereas in the Teleparallel Gravity the mathematical object associated to gravitational field is the torsion, whose field is the so called Weintzenb\"ock connection. We discuss briefly the advantages of Teleparallel Gravity over General Relativity as well as Weintzenb\"ock connection properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that the recently proposed (2+2) Hamiltonian reduction of Einstein's equations of 4-dimensional spacetimes is consistent with general covariance. The consistency proof is {\it extrinsic}, as it follows from the fact that Hamilton's equations derived from the non-zero gravitational Hamiltonian are identical to the Ricci-flat condition of 4-dimensional spacetimes in privileged coordinates.</description>

      <title>Polarization modes of gravitational waves in general Einstein-vector theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the polarization modes of gravitational waves in general Einstein-vector theory with an arbitrary constant background vector field under a Minkowski background. We compare these polarization modes with those of other vector-tensor theories and constrain the parameter spaces based on the gravitational-wave event GW170817 with its electromagnetic counterpart GRB170817A and observations of pulsar timing arrays. The presence of the background vector field leads to the anisotropy of space and a rich variety of gravitational waves contents. Our results reveal that the polarization modes of gravitational waves depend on the parameter spaces. There are at least two and at most five independent polarization modes in one parameter space. In different parameter spaces, some mixture modes are allowed, including tensor-vector, tensor-scalar, tensor-vector-scalar, vector-scalar, and scalar-scalar mixture modes, as well as five independent modes (excluding $P_l$): $P_+$, $P_{\times}$, $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_b$. In all regions of the parameter spaces, there are always two tensor modes, which can be either independent of or mixed with other modes. The independent $P_b$ mode consistently exhibits the same speed as light. If the speed of tensorial gravitational waves strictly equals that of light, only the $P_+$, $P_{\times}$, and $P_b$ modes are permitted. Furthermore, through comparisons of some vector-tensor theories and based on the observations of gravitational waves, the $P_b$ mode is expected to be allowed.</description>

      <title>The Tolman VII Space-time in the Presence of a Charge and a Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tolman VII space-time is one of the few physically acceptable exact solutions in general relativity. In this paper, we derive a generalised Tolman VII solution which includes a charge and a cosmological constant. We analyse the spatial geometry of the solution and present conditions for zero and non-zero spatial curvature. We show that for a particular value of the boundary, the Tolman VII space-time can be matched to the charged Nariai space-time. This represents a new class of solutions interior to Nariai. Matching with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter space-time, we derive analytic expressions for the metric functions and the pressure. Using this, we show that the solution allows for trapped null geodesics for a broad range of values for the charge and the cosmological constant. We investigate a few physical properties and derive an equation of state for the fluid. Performing numerical fitting, we show that the fluid can be considered a polytrope with, $\Gamma \sim 2.4$. Finally, we analyse the energy conditions and conclude that the solution follows the basic physical acceptability criteria.</description>

Abstract: We explore the introduction of the cosmological constant via equivalent transformations in cosmology.

We discuss how this approach allows us to relate different physical systems, providing insights into the role of the cosmological constant in cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore alternative formulations of the analogy between viable Horndeski gravity and Eckart's first-order thermodynamics. We single out a class of identifications for the effective stress-energy tensor of the scalar field fluid that, upon performing the imperfect fluid decomposition, yields constitutive relations that can be mapped onto Eckart's theory. We then investigate how different couplings to Einstein's gravity, at the level of the field equations, can affect the thermodynamic formalism overall. Lastly, we specialise the discussion to the case of ``traditional'' scalar-tensor theories and identify a specific choice of the coupling function that leads to a significant simplification of the formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent detections of gravitational waves have made black hole quasinormal modes a powerful tool in testing predictions of general relativity. Understanding the spectrum of these quasinormal modes in a broad class of theories beyond general relativity and a variety of astrophysical environments around black holes remains vital. In this work, we study the quasinormal mode spectrum of parametrized deformations of a non-rotating black hole in the vacuum. Following Vigeland and Hughes, we model these parametrized deformations as axisymmetric multipole moments in the Weyl coordinates with amplitudes much less than the amplitude of the Schwarzschild potential. These tiny bumps in the black hole geometry satisfy the linearized vacuum Einstein equations and are asymptotically flat. We use the recently developed modified Teukolsky formalism to derive one decoupled differential equation for the radiative Weyl scalar $\Psi_0$. We then use the eigenvalue perturbation method to compute the quasinormal mode frequency shifts of both even- and odd-parity modes with $\ell=2,3$ and up to the overtone number $n=2$ for the Weyl multipoles with $\ell_W=2,3$. Our calculation provides an avenue to directly connect the multipole moments of a modified black hole spacetime to the QNM frequency shifts in a parametric way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate some extensions of the Kiselev black hole solutions in the context of $f(\mathbb{T},\CMcal{T})$ gravity. By mapping the components of the Kiselev energy-momentum tensor into the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor and assuming a particular form of $f(\mathbb{T},\CMcal{T})$, we obtain exact solutions for the field equation in this theory that carries dependence on the coupling constant and on the parameter of the equation of state of the fluid. We show that in this scenario of modified gravity some new structure is added to the geometry of spacetime as compared to the Kiselev black hole. We analyse the energy conditions, mass, horizons and the Hawking temperature considering particular values for the parameter of the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Revisiting quantum field theory in Rindler spacetime with superselection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) in Rindler spacetime is a gateway to understanding unitarity and information loss paradoxes in curved spacetime. Rindler coordinates map Minkowski spacetime onto regions with horizons, effectively dividing accelerated observers into causally disconnected sectors. Employing standard quantum field theory techniques and Bogoliubov transformations between Minkowski and Rindler coordinates yields entanglement between states across these causally separated regions of spacetime. This results in a breakdown of unitarity, implying that information regarding the entangled partner may be irretrievably lost beyond the Rindler horizon. As a consequence, one has a situation of pure states evolving into mixed states. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for comprehending this phenomenon using a recently proposed formulation of direct-sum quantum field theory (DQFT), which is grounded in superselection rules formulated by the parity and time reversal ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. In the context of DQFT applied to Rindler spacetime, we demonstrate that each Rindler observer can, in principle, access pure states within the horizon, thereby restoring unitarity. However, our analysis also reveals the emergence of a thermal spectrum of Unruh radiation. This prompts a reevaluation of entanglement in Rindler spacetime, where we propose a novel perspective on how Rindler observers may reconstruct complementary information beyond the horizon. Furthermore, we revisit the implications of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem within the framework of DQFT. Lastly, we underscore how our findings contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at elucidating the role of unitarity in quantum field theory within the context of de Sitter and black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Continuation of Bianchi Spacetimes Through The Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a framework in which the relational description of General Relativity can be used to smoothly continue cosmological dynamical systems through the Big Bang without invoking quantum gravity effects. Cosmological spacetimes contain as a key dynamical variable a notion of scale through the volume factor $\nu$. However no cosmological observer is ever able to separate their measuring apparatus from the system they are measuring, in that sense every measurement is a relative one and measurable dynamical variables are in fact dimensionless ratios. This is manifest in the identification of a scaling symmetry or ``Dynamical Similarity" in the Einstein-Hilbert action associated with the volume factor. By quotienting out this scaling symmetry, we form a relational system defined on a contact manifold whose dynamical variables are decoupled from scale. When the phase space is reduced to shape space, we show that there exist unique solutions to the equations of motion that pass smoothly through the initial cosmological singularity in flat FLRW, Bianchi I and Quiescent Bianchi IX cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Fast inspirals and the treatment of orbital resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a compact object orbits a massive black hole, are a key source of gravitational waves for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to their small mass ratio, ($\epsilon \sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-7}$), the binary evolves slowly and EMRI signals will be in-band for years. Additionally, astrophysical EMRIs are expected to have complex dynamics featuring both spin-precession and eccentricity. A standard approach to modelling these inspirals is via the method of osculating geodesics (OG) which we employ along with a toy model for the gravitational self-force. Using this method requires resolving tens of thousands radial and polar orbital librations over the long duration of the signal which makes the inspiral trajectory expensive to compute. In this work we accelerate these calculations by employing Near-Identity (averaging) Transformations. However, this averaging technique breaks down at orbital resonances where the radial and polar frequencies are an integer ratio of each other. Thus, we switch to a partial averaging transformation in the vicinity of the resonance where the dynamics are characterised by the slow evolution of the so-called "resonant phase". Additionally, we develop an optimal switching criterion to minimise the computation time while maximising accuracy. We find the error in the waveform phase is improved from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ in the fully averaged scheme to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{4/7})$ in the switching scheme. At the same time, this scheme improves the scaling of the computation time from being inversely proportional to $\epsilon$ using OG, to a very weak scaling with $\epsilon$. This results in a speed-up of at least two orders of magnitude for LISA EMRIs with room for further optimisation.</description>

      <title>Memory Burden Effect in Black Holes and Solitons: Implications for PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The essence of the \textit{memory burden} effect is that a load of information carried by a system stabilizes it. This universal effect is especially prominent in systems with a high capacity of information storage, such as black holes and other objects with maximal microstate degeneracy, the entities universally referred to as \textit{saturons}. The phenomenon has several implications. The memory burden effect suppresses a further decay of a black hole, the latest, after it has emitted about half of its initial mass. As a consequence, the light primordial black holes (PBHs), that previously were assumed to be fully evaporated, are expected to be present as viable dark matter candidates. In the present paper, we deepen the understanding of the memory burden effect. We first identify various memory burden regimes in generic Hamiltonian systems and then establish a precise correspondence in solitons and in black holes. We make transparent, at a microscopic level, the fundamental differences between the stabilization by a quantum memory burden versus the stabilization by a long-range classical hair due to a spin or an electric charge. We identify certain new features of potential observational interest, such as the model-independent spread of the stabilized masses of initially degenerate PBHs.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of topological black hole in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to include the effect of high energy and topological parameters on black holes in $F(R)$ gravity, we consider two corrections to this gravity: energy-dependent spacetime with different topological constants, and a nonlinear electrodynamics field. In other words, we combine $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow with ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics theory to see the effects of high energy and topological parameters on the physics of black holes. For this purpose, we first extract topological black hole solutions in $F(R)$% -ModMax gravity's rainbow. Then, by considering black holes as thermodynamic systems, we obtain thermodynamic quantities and check the first law of thermodynamics. The effect of the topological parameter on the Hawking temperature and the total mass of black holes is obvious. We also discuss the thermodynamic topology of topological black holes in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow using the off-shell free energy method. In this formalism, black holes are assumed to be equivalent to defects in their thermodynamic spaces. For our analysis, we consider two different types of thermodynamic ensembles. These are: fixed $q$ ensemble and fixed $\phi$ ensemble. We take into account all the different types of curvature hypersurfaces that can be constructed in these black holes. The local and global topology of these black holes are studied by computing the topological charges at the defects in their thermodynamic spaces. Finally, in accordance with their topological charges, we classify the black holes into three topological classes with total winding numbers corresponding to $-1, 0$, and $1$. We observe that the topological classes of these black holes are dependent on the value of the rainbow function, the sign of the scalar curvature, and the choice of ensembles.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Folk wisdom dictates that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In six dimensions there exists a unique one-parameter family of non-linear conformal electrodynamics for a chiral 2-form gauge field which includes (in a free-field limit) the linear chiral 2-form theory and is related, by dimensional reduction, to the four-dimensional ModMax electrodynamics. In this work, we present the first exact solutions of this theory in presence of gravity. In particular, we will consider plane-wave, Robinson-Trautman, and self-dual dyonic string configurations, generalizing well-known solutions of this type in six-dimensional supergravities with linear chiral 2-form multiplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ``Swampland Program'' aims to discriminate consistent-looking effective field theories that do not admit a UV completion in quantum gravity from those that do. While most often developed under the umbrella of string theory, several swampland criteria have been explored also in other contexts, especially asymptotically safe gravity. A comparison between different approaches can help to clarify the dependence of low-energy constraints on UV physics and thereby shed light on the universality of quantum gravity itself. In this short review we summarise what is known about three important swampland conjectures in string theory and in asymptotic safety. We point out future lines of research that can help to understand to what extent swampland conjectures are absolute, i.e. hold in quantum gravity in general, or relative, i.e. belong only to a specific UV framework.</description>

      <title>Constraining Post-Newtonian Parameters with the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN) approach is the default framework for performing precision tests of gravity in nearby astrophysical systems. In recent works we have extended this approach for cosmological applications, and in this paper we use observations of the anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the time variation of the PPN parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ between last scattering and the present day. We find their time-averages over cosmological history should be within $\sim 20\%$ of their values in GR, with $\bar{\alpha}=0.89^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ and $\bar{\gamma}=0.90^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. We also constrain the time derivatives of these parameters, and find that their present-day values should be within a factor of two of the best Solar System constraints. Many of these results have no counter-part from Solar System observations, and are entirely new constraints on the gravitational interaction. In all cases, we find that the data strongly prefer $\bar{\alpha}\simeq \bar{\gamma}$, meaning that observers would typically find local gravitational physics to be compatible with GR, despite considerable variation of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ being allowed over cosmic history. This study lays the groundwork for future precision tests of gravity that combine observations made over all cosmological and astrophysical scales of length and time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the back-reaction of a quantum scalar field on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. The renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a massless, conformally-coupled quantum scalar field on global AdS space-time in four space-time dimensions acts as a source term on the right-hand-side of the Einstein equations for the quantum-corrected metric. We solve the quantum-corrected Einstein equations numerically and find deviations from pure AdS which increase as the temperature of the quantum scalar field state increases. We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons, and study the mass of these solitons as a function of the temperature of the quantum scalar field.</description>

      <title>On the viability of the QCD axion - dark energy transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This conference thesis summarizes my presentation at Tartu Tuorla Cosmology meeting based on a collaborative work with E.Nardi and C.Smarra \cite{Muursepp:2024mbb}. It is well known that a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson (pNGB) coupled to a confining gauge group obtains a non-zero contribution to its mass through instanton effects. At non-zero temperature, this manifests in temperature-dependent mass $m^{2}(T) \propto T^{-n}$. If these particles come to dominate the energy density of the Universe in the non-relativistic regime they would accelerate the expansion of the Universe for $n&gt;2$, thus providing a dark energy (DE) component. In this work, we outline a scenario in which a pNGB $\phi_{b}$ presently undergoing confinement could realize such a scenario. Using energetic considerations we find that $\phi_{b}$ alone is not enough to produce the experimentally observed amount of DE. However, coupling $\phi_{b}$ to the QCD axion $\phi_a$ allows the transfer of energy from the QCD axion to the pNGB via non-adiabatic level-crossing thus reproducing the observed amount of dark matter (DM) and DE.</description>

Abstract: We reanalyse and extend constraints on mass and charge interferometry identified by Mari et al. (2016). We show that their constraint on the time required for coherent interference can be extended by a factor of two. We extend their analysis to consider experiments in which one interferometer measures gravitational or electric fields generated by another. We note that these analyses imply a maximum separation between a mass or charge interferometer and a decohering gravitational or electric field measurement that can be carried out without backreaction.</description>

      <title>Towards accelerated nuclear-physics parameter estimation from binary neutron star mergers: Emulators for the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the fundamental interactions that determine its properties. However, Bayesian parameter estimation frameworks do not typically sample over microscopic nuclear-physics parameters that determine the EOS. One of the major hurdles in doing so is the computational cost involved in solving the neutron-star structure equations, known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. In this paper, we explore approaches to emulating solutions for the TOV equations: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Gaussian Processes (GP), and a data-driven variant of the reduced basis method (RBM). We implement these emulators for three different parameterizations of the nuclear EOS, each with a different degree of complexity represented by the number of model parameters. We find that our MLP-based emulators are generally more accurate than the other two algorithms whereas the RBM results in the largest speedup with respect to the full, high-fidelity TOV solver. We employ these emulators for a simple parameter inference using a potentially loud BNS observation, and show that the posteriors predicted by our emulators are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the full TOV solver.</description>

Abstract: Generalized uncertainty principles are effective changes to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that emerge in several quantum gravity models. In the present letter, we study the consequences that two classes of these modifications yield on the physics of neutrinos. Besides analyzing the change in the oscillation probabilities that the generalized uncertainty principles entail, we assess their impact on the neutrino coherence length and their possible interpretation as nonstandard neutrino interactions. Constraints cast by present and planned neutrino experiments on the generalized uncertainty principles parameters are also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of physical subsystems in quantum mechanics as compared to classical mechanics poses significant conceptual challenges, especially in the context of quantum gravity. Traditional approaches associate quantum systems with classical ones localized in spacetime, using either Hilbert space factors for finite-dimensional systems or local operator algebras in algebraic quantum field theory. These methods ensure statistical independence for state preparations and measurements. However, canonical linearized quantum gravity disrupts this framework by preventing the formation of gauge-invariant local algebras, thereby undermining the statistical independence required in measurements. This presents a major obstacle for modeling early universe cosmology, gravity-induced-entanglement experiments, and poses a significant roadblock toward a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity. A pivotal shift is proposed: the identification of classical and quantum systems should be dynamically evolving rather than static, opening the possibility of a single-world unitary quantum mechanics. This perspective aligns with the broader aim of understanding how classical spatiotemporal existence emerges from quantum mechanics and connects the measurement problem with quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a charged, massive scalar field in the vicinity of an electrically-charged Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG) regular black hole has a spectrum of quasibound states that (in a certain parameter regime) grow exponentially with time, due to black hole superradiance. Superradiant quasibound states are made possible by the enhancement of the electrostatic potential at the horizon in nonlinear electrodynamics; in contrast, the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole does not possess such superradiant quasibound states. Here we compute the spectrum for a range of multipoles $\ell$ across the parameter space, and we find the fastest growth rate in the monopole mode. We find that a regular black hole with a small charge can still trigger a significant superradiant instability if the charge-to-mass ratio of the field is compensatingly large. We estimate the amount of black hole mass that can be deposited in the scalar field, finding an upper bound of circa $20\%$ in the extreme charge scenario. Finally, we consider the stationary bound states at the superradiant threshold, and we conjecture that, due to this instability, the ABG black hole will evolve towards a configuration with charged scalar hair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is a data processing technique for space-based gravitational-wave detectors to create laser-noise-free equal-optical-path-length interferometers virtually on the ground. It relies on the interspacecraft signal propagation delays, which are delivered by intersatellite ranging monitors. Also delays due to onboard signal propagation and processing have a nonnegligible impact on the TDI combinations. However, these onboard delays were only partially considered in previous TDI-related research; onboard optical path lengths have been neglected so far. In this paper, we study onboard optical path lengths in TDI. We derive analytical models for their coupling to the second-generation TDI Michelson combinations and verify these models numerically. Furthermore, we derive a compensation scheme for onboard optical path lengths in TDI and validate its performance via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Impact of post-Born lensing on the CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.05662v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lensing of the CMB is affected by post-Born lensing, producing corrections to the convergence power spectrum and introducing field rotation. We show numerically that the lensing convergence power spectrum is affected at the $\lesssim 0.2\%$ level on accessible scales, and that this correction and the field rotation are negligible for observations with arcminute beam and noise levels $\gtrsim 1 \mu {\text{K}}\,{\text{arcmin}} $. The field rotation generates $\sim 2.5\%$ of the total lensing B-mode polarization amplitude ($0.2\%$ in power on small scales), but has a blue spectrum on large scales, making it highly subdominant to the convergence B modes on scales where they are a source of confusion for the signal from primordial gravitational waves. Since the post-Born signal is non-linear, it also generates a bispectrum with the convergence. We show that the post-Born contributions to the bispectrum substantially change the shape predicted from large-scale structure non-linearities alone, and hence must be included to estimate the expected total signal and impact of bispectrum biases on CMB lensing reconstruction quadratic estimators and other observables. The field-rotation power spectrum only becomes potentially detectable for noise levels $\ll 1 \mu {\text{K}}\,{\text{arcmin}}$, but its bispectrum with the convergence may be observable at $\sim 3\sigma$ with Stage IV observations. Rotation-induced and convergence-induced B modes are slightly correlated by the bispectrum, and the bispectrum also produces additional contributions to the lensed BB power spectrum.</description>

      <title>A dynamical inflaton coupled to strongly interacting matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the inflationary theory of cosmology, most elementary particles in the current universe were created during a period of reheating after inflation. In this work we self-consistently couple the Einstein-inflaton equations to a strongly coupled quantum field theory (QFT) as described by holography. We show that this leads to an inflating universe, a reheating phase and finally a universe dominated by the QFT in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Exploring the NANOGrav Signal and Planet-mass Primordial Black Holes through Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data recently released by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) provides compelling evidence supporting the existence of a stochastic signal that aligns with a gravitational-wave background. We show that the scalar-induced gravitational waves from the Higgs inflation model with the parametric amplification mechanism can explain this signal. Such a gravitational-wave background naturally predicts the substantial existence of planet-mass primordial black holes, which can be planet 9 in our solar system and the lensing objects for the ultrashort-timescale microlensing events observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Therefore, the NANOGrav signal, the potential Planet 9 in our solar system, and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment can be explained within the framework of Higgs inflation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic superstrings and gauge strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a phenomenological comparison of the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum expected from cosmic gauge string networks and superstring networks comprised of multiple string types. We show how violations of scaling behavior and the evolution of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe affect the GW spectrum. We derive simple analytical expressions for the GW spectrum from superstrings and gauge strings that are valid for all frequencies relevant to pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and laser interferometers. We analyze the latest data from PTAs and show that superstring networks are consistent with 32 nHz data from NANOGrav, but are excluded by 3.2 nHz data at $3\sigma$ unless the string coupling $g_s&lt;0.2$ or the strings evolve in only about 10\% of the volume of the higher-dimensional space. We also point out that while gauge string networks are excluded by NANOGrav-15 data at $3\sigma$, they are completely compatible with EPTA and PPTA data. Finally, we study correlations between GW signals at PTAs and laser interferometers.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of gravity in a framework of emergent quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the emergent origin of gravity in the framework of Hamilton-Randers theory, a theoretical framework for emergent quantum mechanics. After presenting the essential ingredients of the theory, a derivation of the weak equivalence principle from the first principles of the theory follows. Then it is shown that the Newtonian model of gravity and certain modified gravity models are consistent with Hamilton-Randers theory. One of these models has strong formal resemblance with MOND, providing further ground to think that Hamilton-Randers theory could be a natural theoretical frame for realistic modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>A Search for Classical Subsystems in Quantum Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the "pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.</description>
