      <title>Detecting Exomoons in Free-Floating-Planet Events from Space-based Microlensing Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a planet is ejected from its star-planet system due to dynamical interactions, its satellite may remain gravitationally bound to the planet. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will be capable of detecting a large number of low-mass free-floating planet events (FFPs) from a bulge microlensing survey. We assess the feasibility of detecting satellites (a.k.a., exomoons) orbiting FFPs by simulating CSST light curves and calculating the detection efficiency as a function of satellite-to-planet mass ratios (q) and projected separations (s) in units of the Einstein radius. For a Neptune-class FFP in the Galactic disk with a Sun-like star as the microlensed source, CSST can detect Earth-mass satellites over a decade of separations (from ~0.01 to ~0.1 AU) and has sensitivity down to Moon-mass satellites (q~1e-3) at s~1. CSST also has some sensitivity to detect Moon-mass satellites at s~2 (~0.02 AU) orbiting an Earth-mass FFP in the disk. CSST has substantially reduced sensitivity for detecting satellites when the source star is an M dwarf, compared to a Sun-like source. We also calculate the satellite detection efficiency for the dedicated microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), which demonstrates greater sensitivity than CSST, particularly for M-dwarf sources. Notably, some of the Neptune-Earth systems detectable by CSST and Roman may exhibit significant tidal heating.</description>

      <title>Influence of Planetary Rotation on Supersonic Flow of Lava Planets: A Two-Dimensional Horizontal Model Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of lava planets has attracted significant attention recently because of their close proximity to their host stars, which enhances their detectability for atmospheric characterization. Previous studies showed that the atmospheric flow becomes supersonic if the atmosphere was dominated by rocky vapor evaporated from the magma ocean around the substellar point of small lava planets. These studies often assumed an axisymmetric flow about the axis from the substellar point to the antistellar point but ignored the effect of planetary rotation on the climate. The spin rate of lava planets can be rather fast due to their close-in orbits, which can break the aforementioned symmetry and induce the asymmetric flow component. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional framework to explore the influence of planetary rotation on the atmospheric dynamics of these lava planets for the first time, and assess the sensitivity and range of application of our model. Starting from the established one-dimensional axisymmetric atmospheric solution, we obtain the governing equation for the asymmetric flow by expanding with respect to 1/Ro (Ro denotes Rossby number and exceeds unity for typical lava planets). The asymmetric component of supersonic flow is pivotal for future research on the observation of these atmospheres, flow patterns of the magma ocean currents driven by atmospheric winds, and deformation of the planetary shape over long timescales.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of four hot Jupiters detected by TESS using follow-up spectroscopy from MaHPS at Wendelstein together with NEID and TRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the confirmation and characterization of four hot Jupiter-type exoplanets initially detected by TESS: TOI-1295 b, TOI-2580 b, TOI-6016 b, and TOI-6130 b. Using observations with the high-resolution echelle spectrograph MaHPS on the 2.1m telescope at Wendelstein Observatory, together with NEID at Kitt Peak National Observatory and TRES at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, we confirmed the planetary nature of these four planet candidates. We also performed precise mass measurements. All four planets are found to be hot Jupiters with orbital periods between 2.4 and 4.0 days. The sizes of these planets range from 1.29 to 1.64 Jupiter radii, while their masses range from 0.6 to 1.5 Jupiter masses. Additionally, we investigated whether there are signs of other planets in the systems but have found none. Lastly, we compared the radii of our four objects to the results of an empirical study of radius inflation and see that all four demonstrate a good fit with the current models. These four planets belong to the first array of planets confirmed with MaHPS data, supporting the ability of the spectrograph to detect planets around fainter stars as faint as V=12.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the flux-size relationship in protoplanetary discs by viscous evolution and radial pebble drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the evolution of radiative fluxes, flux radii and observable dust masses in protoplanetary discs, in order to understand how these depend on the angular momentum budget and on the assumed heat sources. We use a model that includes the formation and viscous evolution of protoplanetary gas discs, together with the growth and radial drift of the dust component. We find that we are best able to match the observed fluxes and radii of class 0/I discs when we assume (i) an initial total angular momentum budget corresponding to a centrifugal radius of 40 au around solar-like stars, and (ii) inefficient viscous heating. Fluxes and radii of class II discs appear consistent with disc models with angular momentum budgets equivalent to centrifugal radii of both 40 au or 10 au for solar like stars, and with models where viscous heating occurs at either full efficiency or at reduced efficiency. During the first 0.5 Myr of their evolution discs are generally optically thick at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. However, after this discs are optically thin at mm-wavelengths, supporting standard means of dust mass estimates. Using a disc population synthesis model, we then show that the evolution of the cumulative evolution of the observable dust masses agrees well with that observed in young star forming clusters of different ages.</description>

      <title>MINDS. The influence of outer dust disc structure on the volatile delivery to the inner disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA has revealed that the millimetre dust structures of protoplanetary discs are extremely diverse. It has been proposed that the strength of H$_2$O emission in the inner disc particularly depends on the influx of icy pebbles from the outer disc, a process that would correlate with the outer dust disc radius, and that could be prevented by pressure bumps. This work aims to assess the influence of pressure bumps on the inner disc's molecular reservoirs. Using JWST's MIRI/MRS, we compared the observational emission properties of H$_2$O, HCN, C$_2$H$_2$, and CO$_2$ with the outer dust disc structure from ALMA observations, in eight discs with confirmed gaps in ALMA observations, and two discs with gaps of tens of astronomical units in width, around stars with $M_\star \geq 0.45M_{\odot}$. We used new visibility plane fits of the ALMA data to determine the outer dust disc radius and identify substructures in the discs. We find that the presence of a dust gap does not necessarily result in weak H$_2$O emission. Furthermore, the relative lack of colder H$_2$O-emission seems to go hand in hand with elevated emission from carbon-bearing species. The discs with cavities and extremely wide gaps appear to behave as a somewhat separate group, with stronger cold H$_2$O emission and weak warm H$_2$O emission. We conclude that fully blocking radial dust drift from the outer disc seems difficult to achieve. However, there does seem to be a dichotomy between discs that show a strong cold H$_2$O excess and ones that show strong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$. Better constraints on the influence of the outer dust disc structure and inner disc composition require more information on substructure formation timescales and disc ages, along with the importance of trapping of volatiles like CO and CO$_2$ into more strongly bound ices like H$_2$O and chemical transformation of CO into less volatile species.</description>

      <title>Chondrule dust rim growth: Influence of restructuring using molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of disruptive collisions on chondrule rim growth, emphasizing the role of kinetic energy in determining the outcomes of these interactions. We establish a threshold of approximately 10 cm/s for the "hit-and-stick" collision regime, beyond which significant changes occur in the structure of rimmed chondrules. Our findings highlight that at low collision energies (KE $&lt; 10^{-12}$ J), minimal structural alteration takes place, while higher energies (KE up to $10^{-10}$ J) lead to compaction of the rim, reducing both its thickness and porosity. Collisions with energies exceeding $10^{-8}$ J result in the complete disruption of the rim, with particles being expelled from it. These results are correlated with the turbulence levels within the disk, as kinetic energy scales with the relative velocities of colliding particles. Leveraging machine learning models trained on our collision data, we predict changes in rim characteristics and employ these predictions in a Monte Carlo simulation to explore rim growth dynamics. Our simulations reveal that rim development is sustained in low-turbulence environments ($\alpha \leq 10^{-5}$), while intermediate turbulence levels ($\alpha$ = $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) lead to erosion, preventing further rim accumulation in high-turbulence contexts.</description>

      <title>Tidal Synchronization of TESS Eclipsing Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal synchronization plays a fundamental role in the evolution of binary star systems. However, key details such as the timescale of synchronization, efficiency of tidal dissipation, final rotational period, and dependence on stellar mass are not well constrained. We present a catalog of rotation periods, orbital periods, and eccentricities from eclipsing binaries (EBs) that can be used to study the role of tides in the rotational evolution of low-mass dwarf (FGKM spectral type) binaries. This study presents the largest catalog of EB orbital and rotational periods (Porb and Prot) measured from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS). We first classify 4584 light curves from the TESS Eclipsing Binary Catalog according to out-of-eclipse stellar variability type: starspot modulation, ellipsoidal variability, non-periodic variability, and "other" variability (e.g. pulsations). We then manually validate each light curve classification, resulting in a sample of 1039 candidates with 584 high confidence EBs that exhibit detectable star-spot modulation. From there, we measure and compare the rotation period of each starspot-modulated EB using three methods: Lomb-Scargle periodograms, autocorrelation function, and phase dispersion minimization. We find that our period distributions are consistent with previous work that used a sample of 816 starspot EBs from Kepler to identify two populations: a synchronous population (with Porb \approx Prot) and a subsynchronous population (with 8Porb \approx 7Prot). Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that a bimodal distribution is a significantly better fit than a unimodal distribution for Kepler and TESS samples, both individually or combined, confirming that the subsynchronous population is statistically significant.</description>

      <title>A Characteristic Signature of Magnetospheric Wave-Particle Interactions Found in the Turbulent E-region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves in the magnetosphere scatter electrons, causing them to precipitate deep into Earth's atmosphere, where they impart their temporal characteristics to diffuse aurorae. Using radar-observations of the ionospheric E-region and satellite observations from the magnetosphere, we demonstrate a close and unprecedented association between enhanced electrostatic cyclotron harmonic wave activity in the magnetosphere and the appearance of meter-scale ionospheric plasma turbulence observed a few seconds later in the lower ionosphere on nearby magnetic field lines.</description>

      <title>Rapid Automated Mapping of Clouds on Titan With Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite widespread adoption of deep learning models to address a variety of computer vision tasks, planetary science has yet to see extensive utilization of such tools to address its unique problems. On Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, tracking seasonal trends and weather patterns of clouds provides crucial insights into one of the most complex climates in the Solar System, yet much of the available image data are still analyzed in a conventional way. In this work, we apply a Mask R-CNN trained via transfer learning to perform instance segmentation of clouds in Titan images acquired by the Cassini spacecraft - a previously unexplored approach to a big data problem in planetary science. We demonstrate that an automated technique can provide quantitative measures for clouds, such as areas and centroids, that may otherwise be prohibitively time-intensive to produce by human mapping. Furthermore, despite Titan specific challenges, our approach yields accuracy comparable to contemporary cloud identification studies on Earth and other worlds. We compare the efficiencies of human-driven versus algorithmic approaches, showing that transfer learning provides speed-ups that may open new horizons for data investigation for Titan. Moreover, we suggest that such approaches have broad potential for application to similar problems in planetary science where they are currently under-utilized. Future planned missions to the planets and remote sensing initiatives for the Earth promise to provide a deluge of image data in the coming years that will benefit strongly from leveraging machine learning approaches to perform the analysis.</description>

      <title>NGTS-EB, an eccentric, long-period, low-mass eclipsing binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being the most common types of stars in the Galaxy, the physical properties of late M dwarfs are often poorly constrained. A trend of radius inflation compared to evolutionary models has been observed for earlier type M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries, possibly caused by magnetic activity. It is currently unclear whether this trend also extends to later type M dwarfs below theconvective boundary. This makes the discovery of lower-mass, fully convective, M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries valuable for testing evolutionary models especially in longer-period binaries where tidal interaction between the primary and secondary is negligible. With this context, we present the discovery of the NGTS-EB-7 AB system, an eclipsing binary containing a late M dwarf secondary and an evolved G-type primary star. The secondary star has a radius of $0.125 \pm 0.006 R_\odot$ , a mass of $0.096 \pm 0.004 M_\odot$ and follows a highly eccentric $(e=0.71436 \pm 0.00085)$ orbit every $193.35875 \pm 0.00034$ days. This makes NGTS-EB-7 AB the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary smaller than $200 M_J$ with the mass and radius constrained to better than $5 \%$. In addition, NGTS-EB-7 is situated near the centre of the proposed LOPS2 southern field of the upcoming PLATO mission, allowing for detection of the secondary eclipse and measurement of the companion`s temperature. With its long-period and well-constrained physical properties - NGTS-EB-7 B will make a valuable addition to the sample of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and help in determining accurate empirical mass/radius relations for later M dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>A study of the frequency and characteristics of stellar companions and Jupiter-like planets in nearby open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of companions of solar-type stars in nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) show that they split into two groups: stellar and brown dwarf companions (mass ratio $q&gt;0.05$) and Jupiter-like (JL) planets ($q&lt;0.02$). The frequency of JL planets in NYMGs appears to be higher than that obtained from radial velocity (RV) surveys. We extended the search for companions to three nearby clusters of intermediate age: Hyades, Coma Berenices, and Ursa Major. They are older and formed in more massive events than the NYMGs. The sample of host stars is complete for the core of the clusters, while we considered only a fraction of the tidal tails. We used the same methods considered for the members of NYMGs. We obtained a fairly complete sample of stellar companions and detected six massive JL planets. We found a lower frequency of equal-mass companions than in the NYMGs; this might be related to how binaries form in these environments. We also observed a concentration of stellar binaries in the cores of Ursa Major and Coma Berenices; we attribute this to the selective loss of low-mass systems. The observed scarcity of wide companions in Hyades can be due to the destruction of binaries in close encounters. The frequency of JL planets is lower than in the NYMGs but similar to that obtained from RV surveys. This extends the correlation with age and mass previously found for NYMGs. Results of this study alone do not indicate whether age or mass are the factors driving the observed correlation. A comparison of the frequencies of free-floating planets from microlenses and in young associations favours mass as the main driving parameter. Once the initial cluster mass function is considered, the frequency of JL planets in NYMGs is consistent with the results obtained using RVs.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports observations of regional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface temperature, as well as various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs), ozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent (SIE). We strikingly found warming trends of 0.77(+/-0.57) and 0.69(+/-0.22) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since 2002. These UST trends provide fingerprints of decreasing and no significant trends in total GHG effect in polar and non-polar regions respectively. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of surface cooling trends in both the Antarctic since 2005 and the Arctic since 2016 once the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes, which causes the recent rise in global mean surface temperature (GMST). These temperature changing patterns are consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven electron reaction (CRE) mechanism of halogen-containing GHGs (halo-GHGs) with larger destruction rates at higher latitudes. Moreover, the no-parameter physics model of warming caused by halo-GHGs reproduces closely the observed GMSTs from 2000 to 2024, including the almost no warming during 2000-2012 and the significant warming by 0.2-0.3 deg C during 2013-2023, of which 0.27 deg C was calculated to arise from the net radiative forcing of aerosols and ozone due to improved air quality. The results also show that the physics model captures 76% of the variance in the observed GMSTs, exhibiting a warming peak in October 2023 and predicting a gradual GMST reversal thereafter. The results from this study may greatly improve our understanding of global climate change and lead to the identifying of the correct major culprit for human contribution to changing the climate.</description>

      <title>The Y Dwarf Population with HST: unlocking the secrets of our coolest neighbours -- II. Parallaxes and Proper Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present astrometric results from a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) campaign aimed at determining precise distances for cold Y-type brown dwarfs. Combining observations from a dedicated HST/WFC3 program with archival data, we derive astrometric solutions for 15 nearby Y dwarfs, by linking the high-precision relative astrometry from Hubble to the high-accuracy Gaia DR3 absolute reference system, using stars present in both to anchor the two frames of reference. We reach uncertainties on parallaxes below the 1-mas level for half of the sample, and down to 3 mas for two thirds of the targets, or relative precisions &lt;1% in most cases and 2-5x improvements over previous measurements. For the remaining targets, we achieved slightly lower precisions on parallaxes (5-12 mas, 5-10%), correlated with the lower signal-to-noise of the faintest targets. The precision reached in our derived proper motions is around 0.1-0.4 mas/yr for most targets, and up to 1-2 mas/yr for less precise cases. Our estimated parallaxes and proper motions are generally in good agreement with literature values, and consistent to 1-2 sigma with recent Spitzer-derived parallaxes in most cases. These new astrometric solutions provide important validation of these objects' distances and sky motions, especially given the large disparities seen in previous estimates. Our results demonstrate the power of HST combined with Gaia to measure highly-precise absolute astrometry for faint brown dwarfs, and highlights the limitations reached for the reddest and coldest objects, for which JWST will certainly provide a favourable platform to improve these results.</description>

      <title>A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Effect in Earth's Dayside Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field strength, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations (correlation coefficient = 0.78). During geospace storms, then, turbulent structuring as well as fast electrodynamics in the dayside polar ionosphere can be driven by wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere.</description>
