      <title>Application of the learning from errors principle in tufting machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle of learning from errors is pedagogically powerful but often impractical in industrial settings due to risks to safety and equipment. This paper presents an integrated training approach specifically designed for tufting machine operators. It uses hybrid digital twins, augmented reality (AR), and Petri Net-based modelling to apply the learning from errors principle effectively. Operator actions and errors are simulated via experimentable digital twins (EDTs), and the consequences of errors are visualized in AR, enabling safe, experiential learning. A Petri Net model formally represents the process, including typical faults and recovery paths, and is implemented in VEROSIM using SOML++. This hybrid framework provides a scalable foundation for AR-guided training systems that reduce risk and accelerate skill acquisition.</description>

      <title>Scalable Data-Driven Reachability Analysis and Control via Koopman Operators with Conformal Coverage Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable reachability-based framework for probabilistic, data-driven safety verification of unknown nonlinear dynamics. We use Koopman theory with a neural network (NN) lifting function to learn an approximate linear representation of the dynamics and design linear controllers in this space to enable closed-loop tracking of a reference trajectory distribution. Closed-loop reachable sets are efficiently computed in the lifted space and mapped back to the original state space via NN verification tools. To capture model mismatch between the Koopman dynamics and the true system, we apply conformal prediction to produce statistically-valid error bounds that inflate the reachable sets to ensure the true trajectories are contained with a user-specified probability. These bounds generalize across references, enabling reuse without recomputation. Results on high-dimensional MuJoCo tasks (11D Hopper, 28D Swimmer) and 12D quadcopters show improved reachable set coverage rate, computational efficiency, and conservativeness over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Time Series Based CO2 Emission Forecasting and Energy Mix Analysis for Net Zero Transitions: A Multi Country Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines long-term CO$_2$ emission trajectories across five major economies: Nigeria, the United States, China, Brazil, and Russia, by integrating national energy-mix characteristics with time-series forecasting models. Annual emissions from 2000-2023 were analyzed alongside energy production data to classify countries into fossil-dependent, transition-phase, or renewable-accelerated profiles. Three forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing) were evaluated using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R$^2$ metrics. Results show that Holt-Winters provided the most accurate forecasts for Nigeria, the United States, China, and Brazil, while SARIMA performed best for Russia due to its relatively stable emissions. Long-term projections from 2024 to 2060 indicate divergent decarbonization pathways. Brazil aligns most closely with a low-emission future owing to its renewable-dominant energy system, whereas Nigeria continues on an upward emissions trajectory driven by fossil dependence. The United States and China maintain moderate declines but require accelerated mitigation to reach their respective net-zero commitments. Russia's emissions remain largely flat under current conditions. These findings highlight the strong influence of energy structures on national decarbonization prospects and underscore the need for targeted energy policy reforms to align with global climate objectives.</description>

      <title>Compensating Star-Trackers Misalignments with Adaptive Multi-Model Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive multi-model framework for jointly estimating spacecraft attitude and star-tracker misalignments in GPS-denied deep-space CubeSat missions. A Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) estimates attitude, angular velocity, and gyro bias, while a Bayesian Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) layer operates on a discrete grid of body-to-sensor misalignment hypotheses. In the single-misalignment case, the MEKF processes gyroscope measurements and TRIAD-based attitude observations, and the MMAE updates a three-dimensional grid over the misalignment vector. For a dual-misalignment configuration, the same MEKF dynamics are retained, and the MMAE bank is driven directly by stacked line-of-sight measurements from two star trackers, forming a six-dimensional grid over the two misalignment quaternions without augmenting the continuous-state dimension. A novel diversity metric, $\Psi$, is introduced to trigger adaptive refinement of the misalignment grid around a weighted-mean estimate, thereby preventing premature collapse of the model probabilities and concentrating computation in the most likely region of the parameter space. Monte Carlo simulations show arcsecond-level misalignment estimation and sub-degree attitude errors for both estimation problems, with estimation errors remaining well-bounded, proving robustness and consistency. These results indicate that the proposed MEKF--MMAE architecture enables accurate, autonomous, and computationally efficient in-flight calibration for resource-constrained spacecraft, and establishes dual star-tracker misalignment estimation as a practical option for deep-space CubeSat missions.</description>

      <title>Tube-based robust nonlinear model predictive control of anaerobic co-digestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To match the growing demand for bio-methane production, anaerobic digesters need to embrace the co-digestion of different feedstocks; in addition, to improve the techno-economic performance, an optimal and time-varying adaptation of the input diet is required. These operation modes constitute a very hard challenge for the limited instrumentation and control equipment typically installed aboard full-scale plants. A model-based predictive approach may be able to handle such control problem, but the identification of reliable predictive models is limited by the low information content typical of the data available from full-scale plants' operations, which entail high parametric uncertainty. In this work, the application of a tube-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed to regulate bio-methane production over a period of diet change in time, while warranting safe operation and dealing with uncertainties. In view of its upcoming validation on a true small pilot-scale plant, the NMPC capabilities are assessed via numerical simulations designed to resemble as much as possible the experimental setup, along with some practical final considerations.</description>

      <title>Transient Power Allocation Control Scheme for Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer-Supercapacitor System with Autonomous Inertia Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid hydrogen electrolyzer-supercapacitor system (HESS) with a novel control strategy for renewable-dominant power grids. The HESS consists of alkaline electrolyzers (AEL), proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMEL), and supercapacitors (SC). The interfacing inverters between HESS and power grid are regulated by an inertia emulation control strategy. From HESS, AEL is with conventional DC power control, whereas PEMEL and SC are designed with the proposed dynamic inertia control and capacitive inertia control, respectively. Benefitting from the coordination of three controls, within the HESS, high-frequency transient power components are autonomously handled by SC, stable frequency power components are regulated by PEMEL, and low-frequency steady-state power is addressed by AEL, characterized by low operational gains and longer lifetimes. SC delivers transient power, significantly alleviating energy losses on electrolyzers and achieving adequate inertia recovery capabilities while requiring no additional communication. Implementing SOC recovery control enables the SC to withstand more than three times more stability discharge cycles compared to an SC without SOC recovery. Furthermore, a large-signal mathematical model based on mixed potential theory is established, providing clear stability boundaries for system parameters. Dynamic analyses theoretically verify system feasibility, and extensive hardware-in-the-loop experimental results fully validate the proposed HESS along with the corresponding transient power allocation controls.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Based Whittle Index Policy for Scheduling Wireless Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Sensor nodes used in remote monitoring applications typically transmit data in a timely manner, often optimising for the Age of Information (AoI). However, this approach focuses solely on keeping updates at the sink fresh without considering the actual value of each update. This method is inefficient for sensor networks, which have limited resources. Transmitting data indiscriminately without evaluating its significance not only increases energy consumption but also raises storage requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning-based scheduling strategy that prioritises sensor transmissions based on the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) using an edge mining technique. This ensures that the most valuable updates are received while reducing energy consumption. We frame the scheduling problem as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) and introduce a Whittle Index-based Q-learning (WIQL) policy to dynamically select the most informative sensors. Additionally, we employ an edge mining technique, where raw sensor data is processed locally before transmission, enhancing state estimation at the sink. Experimental results demonstrate that WIQL achieves near-optimal performance while significantly reducing the number of transmitted packets by up to 70%. This reinforcement learning-based approach provides a scalable and adaptive solution for efficient data scheduling in resource-constrained WSNs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Operational Optimization of Energy Storage Systems in User-Side Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An operational optimization strategy for microgrid energy storage systems (ESSs) is developed to address practical user-oriented application requirements, and its effectiveness is validated using real-world operational data. First, a fundamental ESS model is established to characterize system dynamics and operational constraints, providing a theoretical basis for optimization. Subsequently, a multi-objective operational optimization framework is formulated to simultaneously minimize electricity cost, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance renewable energy utilization. To ensure computational efficiency and scalability, the commercial optimization solver Gurobi is employed. The proposed strategy is evaluated using actual microgrid operational data, demonstrating that the developed ESS model accurately represents real system constraints. Compared with existing user operational strategies, the proposed approach achieves an average reduction of 13.47% in electricity cost. Moreover, by dynamically adjusting the weighting factors of the multi-objective formulation, the strategy enables flexible operational modes and significantly improves adaptability to varying operating scenarios. In addition, the proposed framework provides decision support for user-side microgrids participating in surplus electricity feed-in policies. The main contribution of this work lies in its user-centric optimization design, which enhances operational flexibility and scenario adaptability through multi-objective weight allocation, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world microgrid ESS operation.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Efficient Smart Bus Transport Management System with Blind-Spot Collision Detection Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public bus transport systems in developing countries often suffer from a lack of real-time location updates and for users, making commuting inconvenient and unreliable for passengers. Furthermore, stopping at undesired locations rather than designated bus stops creates safety risks and contributes to roadblocks, often causing traffic congestion. Additionally, issues such as blind spots, along with a lack of following traffic laws, increase the chances of accidents. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a smart public bus system along with intelligent bus stops that enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Our approach includes a deep learning-based blind-spot warning system to help drivers avoid accidents with automated bus-stop detection to accurately identify bus stops, improving transit efficiency. We also introduce IoT-based solar-powered smart bus stops that show real-time passenger counts, along with an RFID-based card system to track where passengers board and exit. A smart door system ensures safer and more organised boarding, while real-time bus tracking keeps passengers informed. To connect all these features, we use an HTTP-based server for seamless communication between the interconnected network systems. Our proposed system demonstrated approximately 99% efficiency in real-time blind spot detection while stopping precisely at the bus stops. Furthermore, the server showed real-time location updates both to the users and at the bus stops, enhancing commuting efficiency. The proposed energy-efficient bus stop demonstrated 12.71kWh energy saving, promoting sustainable architecture.

      <title>Simple yet Effective Anti-windup Techniques for Amplitude and Rate Saturation: An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actuator amplitude and rate saturation (A\&amp;RSat), together with their consequent windup problem, have long been recognised as challenges in control systems. Anti-windup (AW) solutions have been developed over the past decades, which can generally be categorised into two main groups: classical and modern anti-windup (CAW and MAW) approaches. Classical methods have provided simple and effective results, mainly addressing amplitude saturation. In contrast, modern approaches offer powerful and theoretically sound solutions capable of handling both amplitude and rate saturations. However, MAW's derivation process often imposes restrictive conditions and can be complex to apply in practical engineering problems. Nevertheless, the literature has paid limited attention (if not entirely ignored) to the potential of simple yet effective CAW schemes that can operate in the presence of both A\&amp;RSat elements. This paper revisits this issue and proposes modifications to two well-known controllers: PID and LQI. The obtained results, benchmarked on the REMUS AUV yaw control problem and compared with constrained MPC, indicate that these classical techniques can still provide simple yet effective solutions with comparable performance, at least for SISO systems. These findings may stimulate further research into solutions that achieve comparable performance with only one (or a limited number of) additional tuning parameters and straightforward implementation.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-based Self-triggered Observed Platoon Control for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates autonomous vehicle (AV) platoon control under uncertain dynamics and intermittent communication, which remains a critical challenge in intelligent transportation systems. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive consensus tracking control framework for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs). The proposed approach integrates backstepping design, a nonlinear sampled-data observer, radial basis function neural networks, and a self-triggered communication mechanism. The radial basis function neural networks approximate unknown nonlinearities and time-varying disturbances, thereby enhancing system robustness. A distributed observer estimates neighboring states based on limited and intermittent measurements, thereby reducing dependence on continuous communication. Moreover, self-triggered mechanism is developed to determine triggering instants, guaranteeing a strictly positive minimum inter-event time and preventing Zeno behavior. The theoretical analysis proves that all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), and tracking errors converge to a compact set. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high robustness, adaptability, and communication efficiency, making it suitable for real-world networked vehicle systems.</description>

      <title>Sampling Strategy Design for Model Predictive Path Integral Control on Legged Robot Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has emerged as a powerful sampling-based optimal control method for complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional systems. However, directly applying MPPI to legged robotic systems presents several challenges. This paper systematically investigates the role of sampling strategy design within the MPPI framework for legged robot locomotion. Based upon the idea of structured control parameterization, we explore and compare multiple sampling strategies within the framework, including both unstructured and spline-based approaches. Through extensive simulations on a quadruped robot platform, we evaluate how different sampling strategies affect control smoothness, task performance, robustness, and sample efficiency. The results provide new insights into the practical implications of sampling design for deploying MPPI on complex legged systems.</description>

      <title>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework--Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin--that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone.
  Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CAISO TAC-area dataset spanning Nov 2023--Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins.
  We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16, p &lt; 10^{-16}), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest Reserve_{99.5}% margin (14.12%) compared to 16.66% for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Information Transfer via Digital Semantic Communication in UAV-Based Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In smart cities, bandwidth-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) often fail to relay mission-critical data in time, compromising real-time decision-making. This highlights the need for faster and more efficient transmission of only the most relevant information. To address this, we propose DSC-UAV model, leveraging a context-adaptive Digital Semantic Communication (DSC) framework. This model redefines aerial data transmission through three core components: prompt-aware encoding, dynamic UAV-enabled relaying, and user mobility-optimized reinforcement learning. Ground users transmit context-driven visual content. Images are encoded via Vision Transformer combined with a prompt-text encoder to generate semantic features based on the desired context (generic or object-specific). These features are then quantized and transmitted over a UAV network that dynamically relays the data. Joint trajectory and resource allocation are optimized using Truncated Quantile Critic (TQC)-aided reinforcement learning technique, which offers greater stability and precision over standard SAC and TD3 due to its resistance to overestimation bias. Simulations demonstrate significant performance improvement, up to 22\% gain in semantic-structural similarity and 14\% reduction in Age of Information (AoI) compared to digital and prior UAV-semantic communication baselines. By integrating mobility control with context-driven visual abstraction, DSC-UAV advances resilient, information-centric surveillance for next-generation UAV networks in bandwidth-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Full-Time-Scale Power Management Strategy for Hybrid AC/DC/DS Microgrid with Dynamic Concatenation and Autonomous Frequency / Voltage Restorations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid AC/DC microgrids with distributed energy storage (DS) improve power reliability in remote areas. Existing power management methods either focus on steady-state power sharing or transient inertia support, but rarely combine both. They also often ignore frequency and voltage deviations caused by droop control, which can harm sensitive loads. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a full-time-scale (FTS) power management strategy that unifies transient inertia sharing and steady-state power allocation through a novel dynamic concatenator. It also introduces autonomous frequency/voltage restoration to eliminate steady-state deviations in each subgrid. Additionally, a global equivalent circuit model (GECM) is developed to simplify system analysis and design. Experiments confirm that the approach maintains nominal frequency and voltage in steady state while enabling seamless transition between transient inertia support and proportional power sharing across all time scales.</description>

      <title>Cross-Directional Modelling and Control of Slot-Die Battery Electrode Coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global battery demand increases, real-time process control becomes increasingly important for battery electrode manufacturing, yet slot-die lines are still mostly manually operated in open loop. This paper develops a physics-based modelling-and-control pipeline for film-thickness regulation. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations provide the data from which a low-order cross-directional model is identified and calibrated. Numerical simulations demonstrate close agreement between the CFD and the cross-directional model, which is used to design a controller that can be used in both real-time, automated feedback operation and manual feedforward operation during line commissioning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybergenetic gene expression control in bacteria enables applications in engineering biology, drug development, and biomanufacturing. AI-based controllers offer new possibilities for real-time, single-cell-level regulation but typically require large datasets and re-training for new systems. Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) offers better sample efficiency without prior modelling. We apply DeePC to a system with two inputs, optogenetic control and media concentration, and two outputs, expression of gene of interest and host growth rate. Using basis functions to address nonlinearities, we demonstrate that DeePC remains robust to parameter variations and performs among the best control strategies while using the least data.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization with Differentiable MPC: Convergence Analysis under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based policy optimization is a well-established framework for designing reliable and high-performance controllers across a wide range of control applications. Recently, this approach has been extended to model predictive control policies, where explicit dynamical models are embedded within the control law. However, the performance of the resulting controllers, and the convergence of the associated optimization algorithms, critically depends on the accuracy of the models. In this paper, we demonstrate that combining gradient-based policy optimization with recursive system identification ensures convergence to an optimal controller design and showcase our finding in several control examples.</description>

      <title>Finite-State Decentralized Policy-Based Control With Guaranteed Ground Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a finite-state, decentralized decision and control framework for multi-agent ground coverage. The approach decomposes the problem into two coupled components: (i) the structural design of a deep neural network (DNN) induced by the reference configuration of the agents, and (ii) policy-based decentralized coverage control. Agents are classified as anchors and followers, yielding a generic and scalable communication architecture in which each follower interacts with exactly three in-neighbors from the preceding layer, forming an enclosing triangular communication structure. The DNN training weights implicitly encode the spatial configuration of the agent team, thereby providing a geometric representation of the environmental target set. Within this architecture, we formulate a computationally efficient decentralized Markov decision process (MDP) whose components are time-invariant except for a time-varying cost function defined by the deviation from the centroid of the target set contained within each agent communication triangle. By introducing the concept of Anyway Output Controllability (AOC), we assume each agent is AOC and establish decentralized convergence to a desired configuration that optimally represents the environmental target.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dispatch of Electricity and Water in Renewable-Integrated Desalination Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for the optimal dispatch of flexible water desalination plants (WDPs) as hybrid generator-load resources. WDPs integrate thermal generation, membrane-based controllable loads, and renewable energy sources, offering unique operational flexibility for power system operations. They can simultaneously participate in two markets: selling desalinated water to a water utility, and bidirectionally transacting electricity with the grid based on their net electricity demand. We formulate the dispatch decision problem of a profit-maximizing WDP, capturing operational, technological, and market-based coupling between water and electricity flows. The threshold-based structure we derive provides computationally tractable coordination suitable for large-scale deployment, offering operational insights into how thermal generation and membrane-based loads complementarily provide continuous bidirectional flexibility. The thresholds are analytically characterized in closed form as explicit functions of technology and tariff parameters. We examine how small changes in the exogenous tariff and technology parameters affect the WDP's profit. Extensive simulations illustrate the optimal WDP's operation, profit, and water-electricity exchange, demonstrating significant improvements relative to benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Characterizing All Locally Exponentially Stabilizing Controllers as a Linear Feedback Plus Learnable Nonlinear Youla Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a state-space characterization of all dynamic state-feedback controllers that make an equilibrium of a nonlinear input-affine continuous-time system locally exponentially stable. Specirically, any controller obtained as the sum of a linear state-feedback $u=Kx$, with $K$ stabilizing the linearized system, and the output of internal locally exponentially stable controller dynamics is itself locally exponentially stabilizing. Conversely, every dynamic state-feedback controller that locally exponentially stabilizes the equilibrium admits such a decomposition. The result can be viewed as a state-space nonlinear Youla-type parametrization specialized to local, rather than global, and exponential, rather than asymptotic, closed-loop stability. The residual locally exponentially stable controller dynamics can be implemented with stable recurrent neural networks and trained as neural ODEs to achieve high closed-loop performance in nonlinear control tasks.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Guided Cooling Optimization for Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective data center cooling is crucial for reliable operation; however, cooling systems often exhibit inefficiencies that result in excessive energy consumption. This paper presents a three-stage, physics-guided machine learning framework for identifying and reducing cooling energy waste in high-performance computing facilities. Using one year of 10-minute resolution operational data from the Frontier exascale supercomputer, we first train a monotonicity-constrained gradient boosting surrogate that predicts facility accessory power from coolant flow rates, temperatures, and server power. The surrogate achieves a mean absolute error of 0.026 MW and predicts power usage effectiveness within 0.01 of measured values for 98.7% of test samples. In the second stage, the surrogate serves as a physics-consistent baseline to quantify excess cooling energy, revealing approximately 85 MWh of annual inefficiency concentrated in specific months, hours, and operating regimes. The third stage evaluates guardrail-constrained counterfactual adjustments to supply temperature and subloop flows, demonstrating that up to 96% of identified excess can be recovered through small, safe setpoint changes while respecting thermal limits and operational constraints. The framework yields interpretable recommendations, supports counterfactual analyses such as flow reduction during low-load periods and redistribution of thermal duty across cooling loops, and provides a practical pathway toward quantifiable reductions in accessory power. The developed framework is readily compatible with model predictive control and can be extended to other liquid-cooled data centers with different configurations and cooling requirements.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Fault Diagnosis Datasets of Three-phase Asynchronous Motor Under Variable Working Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-phase asynchronous motor are fundamental components in industrial systems, and their failure can lead to significant operational downtime and economic losses. Vibration and current signals are effective indicators for monitoring motor health and diagnosing faults. However, motors in real applications often operate under variable conditions such as fluctuating speeds and loads, which complicate the fault diagnosis process. This paper presents a comprehensive dataset collected from a three-phase asynchronous motor under various fault types and severities, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. The dataset includes both single faults and mechanical-electrical compound faults, such as rotor unbalance, stator winding short circuits, bearing faults, and their combinations. Data were acquired under both steady and transitional conditions, with signals including triaxial vibration, three-phase currents, torque, and key-phase signals. This dataset supports the development and validation of robust fault diagnosis methods for electric motors under realistic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>AFDM for LEO Inter-Satellite Links: Path-Level CSI Prediction and CRLB-Guided Pre-Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) inter-satellite links must cope with strongly doubly selective channels and aged channel state information (CSI). In this paper, the term ``sensing'' refers to the receiver-side identifiability of a small set of dominant delay--Doppler path parameters, quantified via CRLB-type proxies, rather than a full-fledged target-sensing pipeline. Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) provides a sparse delay--Doppler (DD) representation well suited to such channels, yet most existing AFDM designs assume ideal CSI, operate on grid-based channel coefficients, and optimize only communication performance. This paper proposes a two-stage AFDM-based ISAC framework for mobile LEO ISLs that explicitly operates under predicted CSI. In Stage~I, we model the channel by a small number of dominant specular paths and perform sequence prediction directly on their complex gains, delays, and Dopplers, from which we reconstruct the AFDM DD-domain kernel used as the sole instantaneous CSI at the transmitter. In Stage~II, we design a sensing-aware AFDM pre-equalizer by augmenting the classical minimum mean-square error (MMSE) solution with a term obtained from Cram\'er--Rao-type sensitivity measures evaluated under the predicted channel model, leading to a first-order surrogate of a CRLB-regularized pre-equalizer with a single tuning parameter that controls the communication--sensing tradeoff. Simulation results for representative LEO ISL trajectories show that the proposed path-level predictor improves effective-kernel reconstruction over AFDM-unaware baselines, and that, under predicted CSI, the sensing-aware pre-equalizer significantly improves sensing-oriented metrics over outdated-CSI baselines while keeping symbol error rates close to a communication-oriented MMSE design with only modest additional complexity.</description>

      <title>Environment-to-Link ISAC with Space-Weather Sensing for Ka-Band LEO Downlinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ka-band low-Earth-orbit (LEO) downlinks can suffer second-scale reliability collapses during flare-driven ionospheric disturbances, where fixed fade margins and reactive adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) are either overly conservative or too slow. This paper presents a GNSS-free, link-internal predictive controller that senses the same downlink via a geometry-free dual-carrier phase observable at 10~Hz: a high-pass filter and template-based onset detector, followed by a four-state nearly-constant-velocity Kalman filter, estimate $\Delta$VTEC and its rate, and a short look-ahead (60~s) yields an endpoint outage probability used as a risk gate to trigger one-step discrete MCS down-switch and pilot-time update with hysteresis. Evaluation uses physics-informed log replay driven by real GOES X-ray flare morphologies under a disjoint-day frozen-calibration protocol, with uncertainty reported via paired moving-block bootstrap. Across stressed 60~s windows, the controller reduces peak BLER by 25--30\% and increases goodput by 0.10--0.15~bps/Hz versus no-adaptation baselines under a unified link-level abstraction. The loop runs in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ per 0.1~s epoch (about 0.042~ms measured), making on-board implementation feasible, and scope and deployment considerations for dispersion-dominated events are discussed.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Routing to Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have heterogeneous inference energy costs based on which model is used and how much it reasons. To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs.</description>

      <title>Simulations of MRI Guided and Powered Ferric Applicators for Tetherless Delivery of Therapeutic Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well-established modality for pre-operative planning and is also explored for intra-operative guidance of procedures such as intravascular interventions. Among the experimental robot-assisted technologies, the magnetic field gradients of the MRI scanner are used to power and maneuver ferromagnetic applicators for accessing sites in the patient's body via the vascular network. In this work, we propose a computational platform for preoperative planning and modeling of MRI-powered applicators inside blood vessels. This platform was implemented as a two-way data and command pipeline that links the MRI scanner, the computational core, and the operator. The platform first processes multi-slice MR data to extract the vascular bed and then fits a virtual corridor inside the vessel. This corridor serves as a virtual fixture (VF), a forbidden region for the applicators to avoid vessel perforation or collision. The geometric features of the vessel centerline, the VF, and MRI safety compliance (dB/dt, max available gradient) are then used to generate magnetic field gradient waveforms. Different blood flow profiles can be user-selected, and those parameters are used for modeling the applicator's maneuvering. The modeling module further generates cues about whether the selected vascular path can be safely maneuvered. Given future experimental studies that require a real-time operation, the platform was implemented on the Qt framework (C/C++) with software modules performing specific tasks running on dedicated threads: PID controller, generation of VF, generation of MR gradient waveforms.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the training process and inference improvements of deep neural networks (DNNs), specifically Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), using Random Fourier Transformation (RFT). We further explore the role of RFT in model training behavior using Frequency Principle (F-Principle) analysis and show that models with RFT turn to learn low frequency and high frequency at the same time, whereas conventional DNNs start from low frequency and gradually learn (if successful) high-frequency features. We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection. The results indicate the superiority of models with Fourier transformation compared to the conventional counterpart and remain inconclusive regarding the benefits of using trainable Fourier transformation in contrast to the Random variant.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Coupled Network RNA Velocities: A Control-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA velocity is an important model that combines cellular spliced and unspliced RNA counts to infer dynamical properties of various regulatory functions. Despite its wide applicability and many variants used in practice, the model has not been adequately designed to directly account for both intracellular gene regulatory network interactions and spatial intercellular communications. Here, we propose a new RNA velocity approach that jointly and directly captures two new network structures: an intracellular gene regulatory network (GRN) and an intercellular interaction network that captures interactions between (neighboring) cells, with relevance to spatial transcriptomics. We theoretically analyze this two-level network system through the lens of control and consensus theory. In particular, we investigate network equilibria, stability, cellular network consensus, and optimal control approaches for targeted drug intervention.</description>

      <title>Tiny Machine Learning for Real-Time Aquaculture Monitoring: A Case Study in Morocco</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aquaculture, the farming of aquatic organisms, is a rapidly growing industry facing challenges such as water quality fluctuations, disease outbreaks, and inefficient feed management. Traditional monitoring methods often rely on manual labor and are time consuming, leading to potential delays in addressing issues. This paper proposes the integration of low-power edge devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) into aquaculture systems to enable real-time automated monitoring and control, such as collecting data and triggering alarms, and reducing labor requirements. The system provides real-time data on the required parameters such as pH levels, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to control water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions enabling better maintenance, efficient resource utilization, and optimal management of the enclosed aquaculture space. The system enables alerts in case of anomaly detection. The data collected by the sensors over time can serve for important decision-making regarding optimizing water treatment processes, feed distribution, feed pattern analysis and improve feed efficiency, reducing operational costs. This research explores the feasibility of developing TinyML-based solutions for aquaculture monitoring, considering factors such as sensor selection, algorithm design, hardware constraints, and ethical considerations. By demonstrating the potential benefits of TinyML in aquaculture, our aim is to contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient farming practices.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Functions can Exactly Quantify Rate Performance of Nonlinear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pointwise-in-time stability notions for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) provide quantitative metrics for system performance by establishing bounds on the rate of decay of the system state in terms of initial condition -- allowing stability to be quantified by e.g. the maximum provable decay rate. Such bounds may be obtained by finding suitable Lyapunov functions using, e.g. Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization. While Lyapunov tests have been proposed for numerous pointwise-in-time stability notions, including exponential, rational, and finite-time stability, it is unclear whether these characterizations are able to provide accurate bounds on system performance.
  In this paper, we start by proposing a generalized notion of rate performance -- with exponential, rational, and finite-time decay rates being special cases. Then, for any such notion and rate, we associate a Lyapunov condition which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for a system to achieve that rate. Finally, we show how the proposed conditions can be enforced using SOS programming in the case of exponential, rational, and finite-time stability. Numerical examples in each case demonstrate that the corresponding SOS test can achieve tight bounds on the rate performance with accurate inner bounds on the associated regions of performance.</description>

      <title>CONSENT: A Negotiation Framework for Leveraging User Flexibility in Vehicle-to-Building Charging under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a robotic system that functions effectively within the specific environment of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner requires solving numerous technical issues, such as maintaining the robot's precision and stability under strong magnetic fields. This research focuses on enhancing MRI's role in medical imaging, especially in its application to guide intravascular interventions using robot-assisted devices. A newly developed computational system is introduced, designed for seamless integration with the MRI scanner, including a computational unit and user interface. This system processes MR images to delineate the vascular network, establishing virtual paths and boundaries within vessels to prevent procedural damage. Key findings reveal the system's capability to create tailored magnetic field gradient patterns for device control, considering the vessel's geometry and safety norms, and adapting to different blood flow characteristics for finer navigation. Additionally, the system's modeling aspect assesses the safety and feasibility of navigating pre-set vascular paths. Conclusively, this system, based on the Qt framework and C/C++, with specialized software modules, represents a major step forward in merging imaging technology with robotic aid, significantly enhancing precision and safety in intravascular procedures.</description>

      <title>EdgeSSVEP: A Fully Embedded SSVEP BCI Platform for Low-Power Real-Time Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) enable users to interact with machines directly via neural activity, yet their real-world deployment is often hindered by bulky and powerhungry hardware. We present EdgeSSVEP, a fully embedded microcontroller-based Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) BCI platform that performs real-time EEG acquisition, zero-phase filtering, and on-device classification within a lowpower 240 MHz MCU operating at only 222 mW. The system incorporates an 8-channel EEG front end, supports 5-second stimulus durations, and executes the entire SSVEP decoding pipeline locally, eliminating dependence on PC-based processing. EdgeSSVEP was evaluated using six stimulus frequencies (7, 8, 9, 11, 7.5, and 8.5 Hz) with 10 participants. The device achieved 99.17% classification accuracy and 27.33 bits/min Information Transfer Rate (ITR), while consuming substantially less power than conventional desktop-based systems. The system integrates motion sensing to support artifact detection and improve robustness and signal stability in practical environments. For development and debugging, the system also provides optional TCP data streaming to external clients. Overall, EdgeSSVEP offers a scalable, energy-efficient, and secure embedded BCI platform suitable for assistive communication and neurofeedback applications, with potential extensions to accelerometer-based artifact mitigation and broader real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Applications of Quantum Computing for Unit Commitment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unit Commitment (UC) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and electricity market scheduling. It determines the optimal on/off status and dispatch of generating units while satisfying system, operational, and market constraints. Traditionally, UC has been solved using mixed-integer programming, dynamic programming, or metaheuristic methods, all of which face scalability challenges as systems grow in size and uncertainty. Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem. The reviewed works are categorized based on the employed quantum paradigms, including annealing-based, variational hybrid, quantum machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods. Key modeling strategies, hardware implementations, and computational trade-offs are discussed, highlighting the current progress, limitations, and potential future directions for large-scale quantum-enabled UC.</description>

      <title>Distributed Federated Learning by Alternating Periods of Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a privacy-focused approach towards machine learning where models are trained on client devices with locally available data and aggregated at a central server. However, the dependence on a single central server is challenging in the case of a large number of clients and even poses the risk of a single point of failure. To address these critical limitations of scalability and fault-tolerance, we present a distributed approach to federated learning comprising multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities. While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers. We show that the DFL algorithm, under a suitable choice of parameters, ensures that all the servers converge to a common model value within a small tolerance of the ideal model, thus exhibiting effective integration of local and global training models. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical claims through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Ageing Monitoring for Commercial Microcontrollers Based on Timing Windows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microcontrollers are increasingly present in embedded deployments and dependable applications, for which malfunctions due to hardware ageing can have severe impact. The lack of deployable techniques for ageing monitoring on these devices has spread the application of guard bands to prevent timing errors due to degradation. Applying this static technique can limit performance and lead to sudden failures as devices age. In this paper, we follow a software-based self-testing approach to design monitoring of hardware degradation for microcontrollers. Deployable in the field, our technique leverages timing windows of variable lengths to determine the maximum operational frequency of the devices. We empirically validate the method on real hardware and find that it consistently detects temperature-induced degradations in maximum operating frequency of up to 13.79 % across devices for 60 {\deg}C temperature increase.</description>

      <title>Sufficient and Necessary Barrier-like Conditions for Safety and Reach-avoid Verification of Stochastic Discrete-time Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions for infinite-horizon safety and reach-avoid verification of stochastic discrete-time systems, derived via a relaxation of the Bellman equations. Unlike prior approaches that primarily focus on sufficient conditions, our work rigorously establishes both necessity and sufficiency for infinite-horizon properties. Safety verification concerns certifying that, starting from a given initial state, the system remains within a safe set at all future time steps with probability at least equal to a specified threshold. For this purpose, we formulate a necessary and sufficient barrier-like condition that captures this infinite-time safety property. In contrast, reach-avoid verification generalizes safety verification by also incorporating reachability. Specifically, it aims to ensure that the probability of the system, starting from a given initial state, eventually reaching a target set while remaining within the safe set until the first hit of the target is no less than a prescribed bound. Under suitable assumptions, we establish two necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions for this reach-avoid specification.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Input Mapping Inversion to Eliminate Algebraic Loops in Hydraulic Actuator Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of nonlinear control schemes to electro-hydraulic actuators often requires several alterations in the design of the controllers during their implementation. This is to overcome challenges that frequently arise in such control algorithms owing to model nonlinearities. Moreover, advanced control solutions for this type of systems often introduce input algebraic loops that pose significant design and tuning difficulties. Conventional methods to avoid such loops introduce chatter, which considerably degrade tracking performance and has oil degradation and wear as side effects. This study presents a nonlinear control architecture for hydraulic actuators that comprises low-complexity modules that facilitate robust high performance in tracking and avoids the drawbacks of chatter. The salient feature is a dynamic input-mapping inversion module that avoids algebraic loops in the control input and is followed by dedicated position control. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using arguments from Lyapunov theory for cascaded non-autonomous nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is evaluated on a high-fidelity simulator of a wind turbine pitch system, and validated on a full-scale laboratory setup that includes a hydraulic pitch system and blade bearing. Appropriate quantitative metrics are used to evaluate the closed-loop system performance in comparison to a state-of-the-art nonlinear design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective parking management is essential for ensuring safety and convenience in master-planned communities, particularly in active adult neighborhoods experiencing rapid growth. Accurately assessing parking utilization is a crucial first step in planning for future demand, but data collection methods can be costly and labor-intensive. This paper presents a low-cost yet highly accurate methodology for measuring parking utilization using pneumatic road tubes connected to portable traffic counters from JAMAR Technologies, Inc. By integrating results from JAMAR's analysis tool with custom Python scripting, the methodology enables precise parking lot counts through automated parameter optimization and error correction. The system's efficiency allows for scalable deployment without significant manual observation, reducing both costs and disruptions to daily operations. Using Tellico Village as a case study, this effort demonstrates that community planners can obtain actionable parking insights on a limited budget, empowering them to make informed decisions about capacity expansion and facility scheduling.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Attention-Based Attack Diagnosis Mechanism for Parallel Cyber-Physical Attacks in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallel cyber--physical attacks (PCPA) can simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and disrupt measurement data transmission in power grids, severely impairing system situational awareness and attack diagnosis. This paper investigates the attack diagnosis problem for linearized AC/DC power flow models under PCPA, where physical attacks include not only line disconnections but also admittance modifications, such as those caused by compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-assisted attack diagnosis framework based on meta--mixed-integer programming (MMIP), which integrates a convolutional graph cross-attention attack localization (CGCA-AL) model. First, sufficient conditions for measurement reconstruction are derived, enabling the recovery of unknown measurements in attacked areas using available measurements and network topology information. Based on these conditions, the attack diagnosis problem is formulated as an MMIP model. The proposed CGCA-AL employs a multi-scale attention mechanism to predict a probability distribution over potential physical attack locations, which is incorporated into the MMIP as informative objective coefficients. By solving the resulting MMIP, both the locations and magnitudes of physical attacks are optimally estimated, and system states are subsequently reconstructed. Simulation results on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed attack diagnosis framework under complex PCPA scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a framework grounded in the theory of describing function (DF) and incremental-input DF to theoretically analyze the nonlinear oscillatory response of automated vehicles (AVs) car-following (CF) amidst traffic oscillations, considering the limits of traffic state and control input. While prevailing approaches largely ignore these limits (i.e., saturation of acceleration/deceleration and speed) and focus on linear string stability analysis, this framework establishes a basis for theoretically analyzing the frequency response of AV systems with nonlinearities imposed by these limits. To this end, trajectories of CF pairs are decomposed into nominal and oscillatory trajectories, subsequently, the controlled AV system is repositioned within the oscillatory trajectory coordinates. Built on this base, DFs are employed to approximate the frequency responses of nonlinear saturation components by using their first harmonic output, thereby capturing the associated amplification ratio and phase shift. Considering the closed-loop nature of AV control systems, where system states and control input mutually influence each other, amplification ratios and phase shifts are balanced within the loop to ensure consistency. This balancing process may render multiple solutions, hence the incremental-input DF is further applied to identify the reasonable ones. The proposed method is validated by estimations from Simulink, and further comparisons with prevailing methods are conducted. Results confirm the alignment of our framework with Simulink results and exhibit its superior accuracy in analysis compared to the prevailing methods. Furthermore, the framework proves valuable in string stability analysis, especially when conventional linear methods offer misleading insights.</description>

      <title>The Frequency Response of Networks as Open Systems</title>

Abstract: Many biological, technological, and social systems can be effectively described as networks of interacting subsystems. Typically, these networks are not isolated objects, but interact with their environment through both signals and information that is received by specific nodes with an input function or released to the environment by other nodes with an output function. An important question is whether the structure of different networks, together with the particular selection of input and output nodes, is such that it favors the passing or blocking of such signals. For a given network and a given choice of the input and output nodes, the H2-norm provides a natural and general quantification of the extent to which input signals, whether deterministic or stochastic, periodic or arbitrary, are amplified. We analyze a diverse set of empirical networks and find that many naturally occurring systems, such as food webs, signaling pathways, and gene regulatory circuits, are structurally organized to enhance the passing of signals; in contrast, the structure of engineered systems like power grids appears to be intentionally designed to suppress signal propagation.</description>

      <title>Robust Control Design and Analysis Based on Lifting Linearization of Nonlinear Systems Under Uncertain Initial Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust control synthesis and analysis framework for nonlinear systems with uncertain initial conditions. First, a deep learning-based lifting approach is proposed to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems with linear parameter-varying (LPV) state-space models in higher-dimensional spaces while simultaneously characterizing the uncertain initial states within the lifted state space. Then, convex synthesis conditions are provided to generate full-state feedback nonstationary LPV (NSLPV) controllers for the lifted LPV system. A performance measure similar to the l2-induced norm is used to provide robust performance guarantees in the presence of exogenous disturbances and uncertain initial conditions. The paper also includes results for synthesizing full-state feedback linear time-invariant controllers and output feedback NSLPV controllers. Additionally, a robustness analysis approach based on integral quadratic constraint (IQC) theory is developed to analyze and tune the synthesized controllers while accounting for noise associated with state measurements. This analysis approach characterizes model parameters and disturbance inputs using IQCs to reduce conservatism. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through two illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Pricing Short-Circuit Current via a Primal-Dual Formulation for Preserving Integrality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronous Generators (SGs) currently provide important levels of Short-Circuit Current (SCC), a critical ancillary service that ensures line protections trip during short-circuit faults. Given the ongoing replacement of SGs by power-electronics-based generation, which have a hard limit for current injection, it has become relevant to optimize the procurement of SCC provided by remaining SGs. Pricing this service is however challenging due to the integrality constraints in Unit Commitment (UC). Existing methods, e.g., dispatchable pricing, restricted pricing and marginal unit pricing, attempt to address this issue but exhibit limitations in handling binary variables, resulting in SCC prices that either fail to cover the operating costs of units or lack interpretability. To overcome these pitfalls, we propose a primal-dual formulation of the SCC-constrained dispatch that preserves the binary nature of UC while effectively computing shadow prices of SCC services. Using a modified IEEE 30-bus system, a comparison is carried out between the proposed approach and the state-of-the-art pricing schemes, highlighting the advantages of the primal-dual method in preserving UC integrality for SCC pricing.</description>

      <title>Distributed Koopman Operator Learning for Perception and Safe Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and scalable framework for predictive and safe autonomous navigation in dynamic transportation environments by integrating model predictive control (MPC) with distributed Koopman operator learning. High-dimensional sensory data are employed to model and forecast the motion of surrounding dynamic obstacles. A consensus-based distributed Koopman learning algorithm enables multiple computational agents or sensing units to collaboratively estimate the Koopman operator without centralized data aggregation, thereby supporting large-scale and communication-efficient learning across a networked system. The learned operator predicts future spatial densities of obstacles, which are subsequently represented through Gaussian mixture models. Their confidence ellipses are approximated by convex polytopes and embedded as linear constraints in the MPC formulation to guarantee safe and collision-free navigation. The proposed approach not only ensures obstacle avoidance but also scales efficiently with the number of sensing or computational nodes, aligning with cooperative perception principles in autonomous navigation applications. Theoretical convergence guarantees and predictive constraint formulations are established, and extensive simulations demonstrate reliable, safe, and computationally efficient navigation performance in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks have become a dominant computational workload across cloud and edge platforms, but rapid growth in model size and deployment diversity has exposed hardware bottlenecks increasingly dominated by memory movement, communication, and irregular operators rather than peak arithmetic throughput. This survey reviews the technology landscape for hardware acceleration of deep learning, spanning GPUs and tensor-core architectures; domain-specific accelerators (e.g., TPUs/NPUs); FPGA-based designs; ASIC inference engines; and emerging LLM-serving accelerators such as LPUs (language processing units), alongside in-/near-memory computing and neuromorphic/analog approaches. We organize the space using a unified taxonomy across (i) workloads (CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers/LLMs), (ii) execution settings (training vs.\ inference; datacenter vs.\ edge), and (iii) optimization levers (reduced precision, sparsity and pruning, operator fusion, compilation and scheduling, and memory-system/interconnect design). We synthesize key architectural ideas including systolic arrays, vector and SIMD engines, specialized attention and softmax kernels, quantization-aware datapaths, and high-bandwidth memory, and we discuss how software stacks and compilers bridge model semantics to hardware. Finally, we highlight open challenges -- including efficient long-context LLM inference (KV-cache management), robust support for dynamic and sparse workloads, energy- and security-aware deployment, and fair benchmarking -- and point to promising directions for the next generation of neural acceleration.</description>

      <title>From Optimization to Control: Quasi Policy Iteration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent control algorithms for Markov decision processes (MDPs) have been designed using an implicit analogy with well-established optimization algorithms. In this paper, we adopt the quasi-Newton method (QNM) from convex optimization to introduce a novel control algorithm coined as quasi-policy iteration (QPI). In particular, QPI is based on a novel approximation of the ``Hessian'' matrix in the policy iteration algorithm, which exploits two linear structural constraints specific to MDPs and allows for the incorporation of prior information on the transition probability kernel. While the proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as value iteration, it exhibits an empirical convergence behavior similar to that of QNM with a low sensitivity to the discount factor.</description>

      <title>Any-Time Regret-Guaranteed Algorithm for Control of Linear Quadratic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves anytime regret of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{t})$, with explicit dependence on the system dimensions and on the solution of the Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE). Our approach builds on the SDP-based framework of \cite{cohen2019learning}, using an appropriately tuned regularization and a sufficiently accurate initial estimate to construct confidence ellipsoids for control design. A carefully designed input-perturbation mechanism is incorporated to ensure anytime performance. We develop two variants of the algorithm. The first enforces a notion of strong sequential stability, requiring each policy to be stabilizing and successive policies to remain close. However, enforcing this notion results in a suboptimal regret scaling. The second removes the sequential-stability requirement and instead requires only that each generated policy be stabilizing. Closed-loop stability is then preserved through a dwell-time-inspired policy-update rule, adapting ideas from switched-systems control to carefully balance exploration and exploitation. This class of algorithms also addresses key shortcomings of most existing approaches including certainty-equivalence-based methods which typically guarantee stability only in the Lyapunov sense and lack explicit uniform high-probability bounds on the state trajectory expressed in system-theoretic terms. Our analysis explicitly characterizes the trade-off between state amplification and regret, and shows that partially relaxing the sequential-stability requirement yields optimal regret. Finally, our method eliminates the need for any a priori bound on the norm of the DARE solution, an assumption required by all existing computationally efficient optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) based algorithms, and thereby removes the reliance of regret guarantees on such external inputs.</description>

      <title>No Minima, No Collisions: Combining Modulation and Control Barrier Function Strategies for Feasible Dynamic Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs) have become a central tool for real-time safety-critical control due to their applicability to general control-affine systems and their ability to enforce constraints through optimization. Yet, they often generate trajectories with undesirable local minima that prevent convergence to goals. On the other hand, Modulation of Dynamical Systems (Mod-DS) methods (including normal, reference, and on-manifold variants) reshape nominal vector fields geometrically and achieve obstacle avoidance with few or even no local minima. However, Mod-DS provides no straightforward mechanism for handling input constraints and remains largely restricted to fully actuated systems. In this paper, we revisit the theoretical foundations of both approaches and show that, despite their seemingly different constructions, the normal Mod-DS is a special case of the CBF-QP, and the reference Mod-DS is linked to the CBF-QP through a single shared equation. These connections motivate our Modulated CBF-QP (MCBF-QP) framework, which introduces reference and on-manifold modulation variants that reduce or fully eliminate the spurious equilibria inherent to CBF-QPs for general control-affine systems operating in dynamic, cluttered environments. We validate the proposed controllers in simulated hospital settings and in real-world experiments on fully actuated Ridgeback robots and underactuated Fetch platforms. Across all evaluations, Modulated CBF-QPs consistently outperform standard CBF-QPs on every performance metric.</description>

      <title>AdGT: Decentralized Gradient Tracking with Tuning-free Per-Agent Stepsize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In decentralized optimization, the choice of stepsize plays a critical role in algorithm performance. A common approach is to use a shared stepsize across all agents to ensure convergence. However, selecting an optimal stepsize often requires careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and may lead to slow convergence, especially when there is significant variation in the smoothness (L-smoothness) of local objective functions across agents. Individually tuning stepsizes per agent is also impractical, particularly in large-scale networks. To address these limitations, we propose AdGT, an adaptive gradient tracking method that enables each agent to adjust its stepsize based on the smoothness of its local objective. We prove that AdGT achieves linear convergence to the global optimal solution. Through numerical experiments, we compare AdGT with fixed-stepsize gradient tracking methods and demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we compare AdGT with adaptive gradient descent (AdGD) in a centralized setting and observe that fully adaptive stepsizes offer greater benefits in decentralized networks than in centralized ones.</description>

      <title>Convergence Filters for Efficient Economic MPC of Non-dissipative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note presents a novel and efficient Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) scheme specifically designed for non-dissipative systems subject to state and input constraints. To address the stability challenge of EMPC for constrained non-dissipative systems, a new concept of convergence filters is introduced. Three alternative convergence filters are designed accordingly to be incorporated into the receding horizon optimization problem of EMPC. To improve online computational efficiency, the variable horizon approach without explicit terminal state constraints is adopted. This design allows for a flexible trade-off among convergence speed, economic performance, and computational burden via simple parameter adjustment. Moreover, sufficient conditions are rigorously derived to guarantee recursive feasibility and stability. The advantages of the proposed EMPC are validated through simulations on a classical non-dissipative continuous stirred-tank reactor.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Linear Behavior in Large-Scale Dynamical Systems via Spatial Averaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, can be described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. These systems are similar in being comprised of a large number of microscopic subsystems, each with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions, that collectively give rise to different forms of macroscopic dynamics. Despite significant research, why and how various forms of macroscopic dynamics emerge from underlying micro-dynamics remains largely unknown. In this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics. By extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that \textit{in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that, in addition to technical assumptions, pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity}. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked dynamical systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Spine with Prismatic and Revolute Compliance for Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three torque-controlled actuators, a 1~kHz control board, and protected power electronics in a 1.26~kg package. A floating-base impedance controller with dynamics compensation renders tunable spring-damper behavior along horizontal, vertical, and rotational axes. Benchtop experiments validate the approach: quasi-static tests demonstrate linear force-displacement characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300--700~N/m ($\leq 1.5\%$ error, $R^2 \geq 0.992$), while dynamic trials confirm predictable damping behavior across multiple settings. Furthermore, simulation studies reveal that adapting spine stiffness based on terrain slope and stride length significantly reduces the cost of transport. SPARC provides an open-source platform for systematic studies of spine compliance in legged locomotion, with complete hardware and firmware resources available for community use.

      <title>Towards a Multi-Layer Defence Framework for Securing Near-Real-Time Operations in Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.</description>

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making is often compromised by cognitive biases and outcome dependency. Current AI models typically mimic historical human behavior, inheriting these biases and limiting their utility for normative improvement. Here, we introduce a Prescriptive AI framework designed to audit, rather than automate, human judgment in real-time environments. By decoupling decision quality from stochastic outcomes, we quantify "decision latency" and status quo bias in elite soccer management - a high-pressure adversarial domain. Analyzing 2018 FIFA World Cup data, our system exposes critical risk states, such as performance collapse following salient positive events (e.g., an assist), which human experts systematically overlook due to outcome bias. These findings demonstrate that interpretable auditing systems can reveal structural flaws in human reasoning that predictive models obscure. This approach establishes a paradigm for Human-AI interaction prioritizing epistemic accountability over predictive mimicry in safety-critical domains.</description>
