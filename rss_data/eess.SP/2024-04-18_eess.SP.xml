      <title>AI-Empowered RIS-Assisted Networks: CV-Enabled RIS Selection and DNN-Enabled Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates artificial intelligence (AI) empowered schemes for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted networks from the perspective of fast implementation. We formulate a weighted sum-rate maximization problem for a multi-RIS-assisted network. To avoid huge channel estimation overhead due to activate all RISs, we propose a computer vision (CV) enabled RIS selection scheme based on a single shot multi-box detector. To realize real-time resource allocation, a deep neural network (DNN) enabled transmit design is developed to learn the optimal mapping from channel information to transmit beamformers and phase shift matrix. Numerical results illustrate that the CV module is able to select of RIS with the best propagation condition. The well-trained DNN achieves similar sum-rate performance to the existing alternative optimization method but with much smaller inference time.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Wireless Networks: Graph Representation, Architecture and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been regarded as the basic model to facilitate deep learning (DL) to revolutionize resource allocation in wireless networks. GNN-based models are shown to be able to learn the structural information about graphs representing the wireless networks to adapt to the time-varying channel state information and dynamics of network topology. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of applying GNNs to optimize wireless networks via answering three fundamental questions, i.e., how to input the wireless network data into GNNs, how to improve the performance of GNNs, and how to evaluate GNNs. Particularly, two graph representations are given to transform wireless network parameters into graph-structured data. Then, we focus on the architecture design of the GNN-based models via introducing the basic message passing as well as model improvement methods including multi-head attention mechanism and residual structure. At last, we give task-oriented evaluation metrics for DL-enabled wireless resource allocation. We also highlight certain challenges and potential research directions for the application of GNNs in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>sEMG-based Fine-grained Gesture Recognition via Improved LightGBM Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface electromyogram (sEMG), as a bioelectrical signal reflecting the activity of human muscles, has a wide range of applications in the control of prosthetics, human-computer interaction and so on. However, the existing recognition methods are all discrete actions, that is, every time an action is executed, it is necessary to restore the resting state before the next action, and it is unable to effectively recognize the gestures of continuous actions. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved fine gesture recognition model based on LightGBM algorithm. A sliding window sample segmentation scheme is adopted to replace active segment detection, and a series of innovative schemes such as improved loss function, Optuna hyperparameter search and Bagging integration are adopted to optimize LightGBM model and realize gesture recognition of continuous active segment signals. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we used the NinaproDB7 dataset to design the normal data recognition experiment and the disabled data transfer experiment. The results showed that the recognition rate of the proposed model was 89.72% higher than that of the optimal model Bi-ConvGRU for 18 gesture recognition tasks in the open data set, it reached 90.28%. Compared with the scheme directly trained on small sample data, the recognition rate of transfer learning was significantly improved from 60.35% to 78.54%, effectively solving the problem of insufficient data, and proving the applicability and advantages of transfer learning in fine gesture recognition tasks for disabled people.</description>

      <title>Semantic Satellite Communications Based on Generative Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite communications can provide massive connections and seamless coverage, but they also face several challenges, such as rain attenuation, long propagation delays, and co-channel interference. To improve transmission efficiency and address severe scenarios, semantic communication has become a popular choice, particularly when equipped with foundation models (FMs). In this study, we introduce an FM-based semantic satellite communication framework, termed FMSAT. This framework leverages FM-based segmentation and reconstruction to significantly reduce bandwidth requirements and accurately recover semantic features under high noise and interference. Considering the high speed of satellites, an adaptive encoder-decoder is proposed to protect important features and avoid frequent retransmissions. Meanwhile, a well-received image can provide a reference for repairing damaged images under sudden attenuation. Since acknowledgment feedback is subject to long propagation delays when retransmission is unavoidable, a novel error detection method is proposed to roughly detect semantic errors at the regenerative satellite. With the proposed detectors at both the satellite and the gateway, the quality of the received images can be ensured. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce bandwidth requirements, adapt to complex satellite scenarios, and protect semantic information with an acceptable transmission delay.</description>

      <title>Environment-aware UAV Communications: CKM Construction and Predictive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive millimeter-wave (mmWave) beamforming is a promising technique to enable low-latency and high-rate ground-air communications for cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the high vulnerability of mmWave to blockages poses practical challenges to the implementation of such a technology. In this paper, we tackle the challenges by proposing a channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted predictive beamforming approach based on the echoed joint communication and sensing signal, whereby the line-of-sight (LoS) link identification is performed via hypothesis testing using prior information provided by CKM. Depending on the identification result, extended Kalman filtering (EKF) is adopted to reliably track the target UAV. Furthermore, if the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) state is identified, the target UAV will be immediately connected to a candidate base station (BS), namely a handover will be triggered to alleviate the communication outage. The simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly enhance the UAV tracking and mmWave communication performance compared to the benchmarking schemes without using CKM or LoS identification.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Electromagnetic Illusions: Empowering Smart Environments with Reconfigurable Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the innovative landscape of metasurfaces, with a particular focus on their role in achieving EM illusion (EMI) a facet of paramount significance. The control of EM waves assumes a pivotal role in mitigating issues such as signal degradation, interference, and reduced communication range. Furthermore, the engineering of waves serves as a foundational element in achieving invisibility or minimized detectability. This survey unravels the theoretical underpinnings and practical designs of EMI coatings, which have been harnessed to develop functional metasurfaces. EMI, practically achieved through engineered coatings, confers a strategic advantage by either reducing the radar cross-section of objects or creating misleading footprints. In addition to illustrating the outstanding achievements in reconfigurable cloaking, this study culminates in the proposal of a novel approach, suggesting the emergence of EMI without the need for physically coating the device to conceal and thus proposing the concept of a smart EMI environment. This groundbreaking work opens a new way for engineers and researchers to unlock exotic and versatile designs that build on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). Crucially the designs enabled by the proposed approach, present a wide array of applications, encompassing camouflaging, deceptive sensing, radar cognition control, and defence security, among others. In essence, this research stands as a beacon guiding the exploration of uncharted territories in wave control through smart EMI environments, with profound implications spanning basic academic research in RIS through advanced security technologies and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Unknown Interference Modeling for Rate Adaptation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-channel interference poses a challenge in any wireless communication network where the time-frequency resources are reused over different geographical areas. The interference is particularly diverse in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, where a large number of user equipments (UEs) are multiplexed by a multitude of access points (APs) on the same time-frequency resources. For realistic and scalable network operation, only the interference from UEs belonging to the same serving cluster of APs can be estimated in real-time and suppressed by precoding/combining. As a result, the unknown interference arising from scheduling variations in neighboring clusters makes the rate adaptation hard and can lead to outages. This paper aims to model the unknown interference power in the uplink of a cell-free massive MIMO network. The results show that the proposed method effectively describes the distribution of the unknown interference power and provides a tool for rate adaptation with guaranteed target outage.</description>

      <title>Secure Semantic Communication for Image Transmission in the Presence of Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a key technology for the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) network, attributed to its enhanced communication efficiency and robustness against channel noise. However, the open nature of wireless channels renders them vulnerable to eavesdropping, posing a serious threat to privacy. To address this issue, we propose a novel secure semantic communication (SemCom) approach for image transmission, which integrates steganography technology to conceal private information within non-private images (host images). Specifically, we propose an invertible neural network (INN)-based signal steganography approach, which embeds channel input signals of a private image into those of a host image before transmission. This ensures that the original private image can be reconstructed from the received signals at the legitimate receiver, while the eavesdropper can only decode the information of the host image. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains comparable reconstruction quality of both host and private images at the legitimate receiver, compared to scenarios without any secure mechanisms. Experiments also show that the eavesdropper is only able to reconstruct host images, showcasing the enhanced security provided by our approach.</description>

      <title>Constrained Stochastic Recursive Momentum Successive Convex Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization problems with functional constraints. If the objective and constraint functions are not convex, the classical stochastic approximation algorithms such as the proximal stochastic gradient descent do not lead to efficient algorithms. In this work, we put forth an accelerated SCA algorithm that utilizes the recursive momentum-based acceleration which is widely used in the unconstrained setting. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm also achieves the optimal SFO complexity, at par with that achieved by state-of-the-art (unconstrained) stochastic optimization algorithms and match the SFO-complexity lower bound for minimization of general smooth functions. At each iteration, the proposed algorithm entails constructing convex surrogates of the objective and the constraint functions, and solving the resulting convex optimization problem. A recursive update rule is employed to track the gradient of the objective function, and contributes to achieving faster convergence and improved SFO complexity. A key ingredient of the proof is a new parameterized version of the standard Mangasarian-Fromowitz Constraints Qualification, that allows us to bound the dual variables and hence establish that the iterates approach an $\epsilon$-stationary point. We also detail a obstacle-avoiding trajectory optimization problem that can be solved using the proposed algorithm, and show that its performance is superior to that of the existing algorithms. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also compared against that of a specialized sparse classification algorithm on a binary classification problem.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmitter and Receiver Design for Movable Antenna Enhanced Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology that utilizes localized antenna movement to pursue better channel conditions for enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we study the MA-enhanced multicast transmission from a base station equipped with multiple MAs to multiple groups of single-MA users. Our goal is to maximize the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users by jointly optimizing the position of each transmit/receive MA and the transmit beamforming. To tackle this challenging problem, we first consider the single-group scenario and propose an efficient algorithm based on the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Particularly, when optimizing transmit or receive MA positions, we construct a concave lower bound for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each user by applying only the second-order Taylor expansion, which is more effective than existing works utilizing two-step approximations. The proposed design is then extended to the general multi-group scenario. Simulation results demonstrate that significant performance gains in terms of achievable max-min SNR/SINR can be obtained by our proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can notably reduce the required amount of transmit power or antennas for achieving a target level of max-min SNR/SINR performance compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>On Target Detection in the Presence of Clutter in Joint Communication and Sensing Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works on joint communication and sensing (JCAS) cellular networks have proposed to use time division mode (TDM) and concurrent mode (CM), as alternative methods for sharing the resources between communication and sensing signals. While the performance of these JCAS schemes for object tracking and parameter estimation has been studied in previous works, their performance on target detection in the presence of clutter has not been analyzed. In this paper, we propose a detection scheme for estimating the number of targets in JCAS cellular networks that employ TDM or CM resource sharing. The proposed detection method allows for the presence of clutter and/or temporally correlated noise. This scheme is studied with respect to the JCAS trade-off parameters that allow to control the time slots in TDM and the power resources in CM allocated to sensing and communications. The performance of two fundamental transmit beamforming schemes, typical for JCAS, is compared in terms of the receiver operating characteristics curves. Our results indicate that in general the TDM scheme gives a somewhat better detection performance compared to the CM scheme, although both schemes outperform existing approaches provided that their respective trade-off parameters are tuned properly.</description>

      <title>Warped Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting time series outliers, focusing on systems with repetitive behavior, such as industrial robots operating on production lines.Notable challenges arise from the fact that a task performed multiple times may exhibit different duration in each repetition and that the time series reported by the sensors are irregularly sampled because of data gaps. The anomaly detection approach presented in this paper consists of three stages.The first stage identifies the repetitive cycles in the lengthy time series and segments them into individual time series corresponding to one task cycle, while accounting for possible temporal distortions.The second stage computes a prototype for the cycles using a GPU-based barycenter  algorithm, specifically tailored for very large time series.The third stage uses the prototype to detect abnormal cycles by computing an anomaly score for each cycle.The overall approach, named WarpEd Time Series ANomaly Detection (WETSAND), makes use of the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and its variants because they are suited to the distorted nature of the time series.The experiments show that \wetsand scales to large signals, computes human-friendly prototypes, works with very little data, and outperforms some general purpose anomaly detection approaches such as autoencoders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roughly 1/3 of adults older than 65 fall each year, resulting in more than 3 million emergency room visits, thousands of deaths, and over $50 Billion in direct costs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 1/3 of falls are preventable with effective mitigation strategies, particularly for imbalance. Therefore, quantification of imbalance is being studied extensively in recent years. In this study we investigate the feasibility of plantar pressure mapping in balance assessment through a healthy human subject study. We used an in-house plantar pressure mapping device with high precision based on Frustrated Total Internal Reflection to measure subjects sway during the Romberg test. Through the measurements obtained from all subjects, we measured the minimum spatial resolution required for plantar pressure mapping devices in assessment of balance. We conclude that most of the current devices in the market lack the requirements for imbalance measurements.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition using Advanced Deep Learning Approaches: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have posed a significant challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR). ASR relies on extensive training datasets, including confidential ones, and demands substantial computational and storage resources. Enabling adaptive systems improves ASR performance in dynamic environments. DL techniques assume training and testing data originate from the same domain, which is not always true. Advanced DL techniques like deep transfer learning (DTL), federated learning (FL), and reinforcement learning (RL) address these issues. DTL allows high-performance models using small yet related datasets, FL enables training on confidential data without dataset possession, and RL optimizes decision-making in dynamic environments, reducing computation costs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of DTL, FL, and RL-based ASR frameworks, aiming to provide insights into the latest developments and aid researchers and professionals in understanding the current challenges. Additionally, transformers, which are advanced DL techniques heavily used in proposed ASR frameworks, are considered in this survey for their ability to capture extensive dependencies in the input ASR sequence. The paper starts by presenting the background of DTL, FL, RL, and Transformers and then adopts a well-designed taxonomy to outline the state-of-the-art approaches. Subsequently, a critical analysis is conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each framework. Additionally, a comparative study is presented to highlight the existing challenges, paving the way for future research opportunities.</description>
