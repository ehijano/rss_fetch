      <title>Superconductivity in Ternary Germanite TaAl$_{x}$Ge$_{2-x}$ with a C40 chiral structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new family of chiral intermetallic superconductors TaAl$_{x}$Ge$_{2-x}$. The mother compound TaGe$_2$ has a C40-type chiral hexagonal crystal structure with a pair of enantiomorphic space groups of $P6{_2}22$ and $P6{_4}22$. By substituting Ge with Al, TaAl$_{x}$Ge$_{2-x}$ polycrystals with the C40 structure were synthesized with Al substitution $x$ from 0 to 0.8. Magnetic susceptibility, magnetization curves and electrical resistivity revealed that TaAl$_{x}$Ge$_{2-x}$ with $x$ of 0.2 to 0.4 was a type-II superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ of 2.0 to 2.2 K. The superconductivity disappeared or was largely suppressed at $x$ less than 0.2 and more than 0.4, although all the measurements were performed at temperatures above 1.8 K. An emergence of superconductivity is discussed in terms of the lattice constants changes with the Al substitution.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface reconstruction in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ on LaAlO$_3$(001) and SrTiO$_3$(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the structural and electronic properties of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 on LaAlO3(001) and SrTiO3(001) by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. For La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/LaAlO$_3$(001), we find that compressive strain and electron doping across the interface result in the unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states. In sharp contrast, no charge transfer is observed for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/SrTiO$_3$(001). Surprisingly, tensile strain drives a metallization of the bonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, rendering a Fermi surface topology resembling the superconducting bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under high pressure. Concomitantly, significant octahedral rotations are retained. We discuss the fundamental differences between hydrostatic pressure and epitaxial strain regarding the crystal geometry and Ni $3d$ orbital occupation, and establish that strain provides a much stronger control over the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization. The results suggest epitaxial La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under tensile strain as interesting system to provide novel insights into the physics of bilayer nickelates and possibly induce superconductivity without external pressure.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective superconductivity in $\gamma$-BiPd: An {\it ab initio} study}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting (SC) properties of experimentally realized $\gamma$-BiPd by solving the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. Our study includes calculations of the SC gap $\Delta_{{\bf{k}}}$, the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda_{{\bf{k}}}$, the superconducting quasiparticle density of states ($N_{s}$), and the critical temperature $T_{c}$. $\gamma$-BiPd posses a complex FS, consisting of four Fermi sheets: two electron pockets and two hole pockets, each characterized by distinct atomic orbitals. Our key finding is that superconductivity in $\gamma$-BiPd is primarily orbital-selective, with significant contributions in $\Delta_{{\bf{k}}}$ and $\lambda_{{\bf{k}}}$ from the Bi $p_z$-orbital at the $K$-point, associated with the neck of electron pocket $E2$ on the FS. While our results reveal an anisotropic nature of $\Delta_{{\bf{k}}}$ and $\lambda_{{\bf{k}}}$ across the FS, we observe a single peak in $N_s$, consistent with experimental observations of single-gapped BCS superconductivity in this material. We also examine the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and find strong impact on both normal and superconducting properties, despite $\gamma$-BiPd being centrosymmetric. Including SOC results in the disappearance of the hole pocket $H2$ from the FS, leading to modification of $\lambda_{{\bf{k}}}$, $\Delta$ and $T_c$. Our calculated $T_c$ values are $\sim$1.26 K without SOC and 0.8 K with SOC, aligning well in order of magnitude with the experimental value of about 3.3 K.</description>

      <title>Collective mode across the BCS-BEC crossover in Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of the collective mode in the phonon spectra of the superconducting state within the Holstein model by varying the electron-phonon coupling. Using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) combined with the numerical renormalization group (NRG) technique, we calculate the phonon spectra. In the superconducting state with a pairing gap ($\Delta_P$), the peak position of the collective mode ($\omega_{col}$) evolves from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) regime, manifesting near $2\Delta_P$ and increasing with coupling, to the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) regime, where $\omega_{col}$ decreases with increasing coupling. The decrease of $\omega_{col}$ matches well with the reduction of superfluid stiffness, which originates from the increasing phase fluctuations of local pairs with coupling strength. In the crossover regime with intermediate coupling, $\omega_{col}$ aligns with the soft phonon mode ($\omega_s$) of the normal state and decreases with increasing coupling when $\omega_s &lt; 2\Delta_P$. Additionally, comparing the collective mode weight to $\Delta_P$ suggests that the collective mode predominantly stems from U(1) gauge symmetry breaking across all coupling strengths.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of vortex and corner zero-energy excitations in the 2D second-order topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the appearance of vortex zero-energy modes in first-order 2D topological superconductors is well known, their possibility to appear in higher-order topological phase of 2D systems has not been completely uncovered yet. Here we demonstrate the coexistence of the zero-energy vortex modes and topological corner modes in the model of 2D second-order topological superconductor. The model describes an interface between a normal layer supporting the topological insulating phase and a superconducting layer, for which different symmetries of the superconducting order parameter are considered: $s_{\pm}$-wave, $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave, as well as $s+d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave. The conditions of coexistence of vortex and corner zero-energy excitations are established and the interaction of vortex modes with the edge and topological corner modes is studied.</description>

      <title>Resonant escape in Josephson tunnel junctions under millimeter-wave irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microwave-driven dynamics of the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson junction is now widely employed in superconducting qubits and quantum circuits. With the typical energy level separation frequency of several GHz, cooling these quantum devices to the ground state requires temperatures below 100 mK. Pushing the operation frequency of superconducting qubits up may allow for operation of superconducting qubits at 1 K and even higher temperatures. Here we present measurements of the switching currents of niobium/aluminum-aluminum oxide/niobium Josephson junctions in the presence of millimeter-wave radiation at frequencies above 100 GHz. The observed switching current distributions display clear double-peak structures, which result from the resonant escape of the Josephson phase from a stationary state. We show that the data can be well explained by the strong-driving model including the irradiation-induced suppression of the potential barrier. While still being measured in the quasi-classical regime, our results point towards a feasibility of operating phase qubits around 100 GHz.</description>

      <title>Surface topological quantum criticality: Conformal manifolds and Discrete Strong Coupling Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum critical phenomena in surfaces of symmetry-protected topological matter, i.e. surface topological quantum criticality. A generic phase boundary of gapless surfaces in a symmetry-protected state shall be a co-dimension one manifold in an interaction parameter space of dimension $D_p$ (where $p$ refers to the parameter space) where the value of $D_p$ further depends on bulk topologies. In the context of fermionic topological insulators that we focus on, $D_p$ depends on the number of half-Dirac cones $\mathcal{N}$. We construct such manifolds explicitly for a few interaction parameter spaces with various $D_p$ values. Most importantly, we further illustrate that in cases with $D_p=3$ and $6$, there are sub-manifolds of fixed points that dictate the universalities of surface topological quantum criticality. These infrared stable manifolds are associated with emergent symmetries in the renormalization-group-equation flow naturally appearing in the loop expansion. Unlike in the usual order-disorder quantum critical phenomena, typically governed by an isolated Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find in the one-loop approximation surface topological quantum criticalities are naturally captured by conformal manifolds where the number of marginal operators uniquely determines their co-dimensions. Isolated strong coupling fixed points also appear, usually as the endpoints in the phase boundary of surface topological quantum phases. However, their extreme infrared instabilities along multiple directions suggest that they shall be related to multi-critical surface topological quantum critical phenomena rather than generic surface topological quantum criticality. We also discuss and classify higher-loop symmetry-breaking effects, which can either distort the conformal manifolds or further break the conformal manifolds down to a few distinct fixed points.</description>

      <title>Non-Majorana-origin of the half-integer conductance quantization elucidated by multi-terminal superconductor-quantum anomalous Hall insulator heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.</description>

      <title>Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We proposed and tested a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. We have measured a Fabry-P\'erot cavity with superconducting mirrors at 10 mK and found out that the quality of a signal transmitted through the dielectric waveguides is sufficient to measure resonator quality factors over one million at 110 GHz.</description>

Abstract: Bogoliubov quasiparticles play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of a superconductor, and in achieving reliable operations of superconducting quantum circuits. Diagnosis of quasiparticle poisoning at the nanoscale provides invaluable benefits in designing superconducting qubits. Here, we use scanning tunneling noise microscopy to locally quantify quasiparticles by measuring the effective charge. Using the vortex lattice as a model system, we directly visualize the spatial variation of the quasiparticle concentration around superconducting vortices, which can be described within the Ginzburg-Landau framework. This shows a direct, noninvasive approach for the atomic-scale detection of relative quasiparticle concentration as small as 10^-4 in various superconducting qubit systems. Our results alert of a quick increase in quasiparticle concentration with decreasing intervortex distance in vortex-based Majorana qubits.</description>

Abstract: We investigate supercurrent nonreciprocal effects in a superconducting weak-link hosting distinct types of vortices. We demonstrate how the winding number of the vortex, its spatial configuration, and the shape of the superconducting lead can steer the sign and amplitude of the supercurrent rectification. We find a general criterion for the vortex pattern to maximize the rectification amplitude of the supercurrent. The underlying strategy is the search for specific vortex core positions yielding a vanishing amplitude of the supercurrent first harmonic. We also prove that supercurrent nonreciprocal effects can be used to diagnose high-winding vortex and to distinguish between different types of vorticity. Our results thus provide a toolkit to control the supercurrent rectification by means of vortex phase textures and nonreciprocal signatures to detect vortex states with nonstandard phase patterns.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of the origin of the double-well band dispersion in the CuO double chains of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ and its impact on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ is a unique member of cuprate superconductors where many studies suggest that CuO double chains are responsible for superconductivity. One characteristic and non-trivial feature of its electronic structure is a relatively large electron hopping $t$ between nearest neighbor Cu sites with a Cu-O-Cu angle of around 90 degrees. In this study, we have theoretically pinned down the origin of a large $|t|$ in the double-chain structure of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ using first-principles calculation and tight-binding-model analysis. We have found that, in the nearest neighbor hopping $t$, $d$-$d$ and $d$-$p$-$p$-$d$ contributions roughly cancel each other out and the $d$-$p$-$d$ hopping path enhanced by the local distortion of the double chain is a key to get the large $|t|$. Double-well band dispersion arising from the relatively large $|t/t'|$ allows the enhancement of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity by the incipient-band mechanism, where the one band bottom plays a role of the incipient valley. Our study provides the important knowledge to understand the unique superconductivity in Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting the spin-valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials is a promising avenue for energy-efficient information storage and quantum computing. A key challenge in utilizing spin-valley polarization is the realization of spin-valley locking in bulk systems. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the noncentrosymmetric bulk misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$), showing a strong spin-valley locking. Our investigation reveals Ising superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.14 K, closely matching that of a monolayer of TaS$_2$. Notably, the absence of charge density wave (CDW) signatures in transport measurements suggests that the PbS layers primarily act as spacers between the dichalcogenide monolayers.
  This is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which shows negligible interlayer coupling, a lack of dispersion along the $k_{\perp}$ direction and significant charge transfer from the PbS to the TaS$_2$ layers. Spin resolved ARPES shows strong spin-valley locking of the electronic bands.
  Muon spin rotation experiments conducted in the vortex phase reveal an isotropic superconducting gap. However, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field and low-temperature specific heat measurements suggest the possibility of multigap superconductivity.
  These findings underscore the potential of misfit compounds as robust platforms for both realizing and utilizing spin-valley locking in bulk materials, as well as exploring proximity effects in two-dimensional structures.</description>

Abstract: The quest for topological superconductors triggers revived interests in resolving non-s-wave pairing channels mediated by phonons. While density functional theory and denstify functional perturbtaion theory have established a powerful framework to calculate electron-phonon couplings in real materials in a first-principles way, its application is largely limited to conventional s-wave superconductivity. Here, we formulate an efficient and simple-to-use algorithm for first-principles pairing channel analysis, and apply it to several representative material systems.</description>
