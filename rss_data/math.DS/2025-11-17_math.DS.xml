      <title>A simple model for the population dynamics in OTC wholesale fresh product markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the combined evidences of bounded rationality, limited information and short-term optimization, over-the-counter (OTC) fresh product markets provide a perfect instance where to develop a behavioural approach to the analysis of micro-economic systems. Aiming at characterizing via a rigorous mathematical analysis, the main features of the spontaneous organization and functioning of such markets, we introduce and we study a stylized dynamical model for the time evolution of buyers populations and prices/attractiveness at each wholesaler. The dynamics is governed by immediate reactions of the actors to changes in basic indicators. Buyers are influenced by some degree of loyalty to their regular suppliers. Yet, at times, they also prospect for potential better offers. On the other hand, sellers primarily aim at maximising their profit. Yet, they can be also prone to improving their competitiveness in case of clientele deficit.
  Our results reveal that, in spite of being governed by simple and immediate rules, the competition between sellers self-regulates in time, as it constrains to bounded ranges the dispersion of both prices and clientele volumes, does similarly for the mean clientele volume, and it generates oscillatory behaviours that prevent any seller to dominate permanently its competitors (and to be dominated forever). Long-term behaviours are also investigated, with focus on asymptotic convergence to an equilibrium, as can be expected for a standard functioning mode. In particular, in the simplest case of 2 competing sellers, a normal-form-like analysis proves that such convergence holds, provided that the buyer's loyalty is sufficiently high or the sellers' reactivity is sufficiently low. In other words, this result identifies and proves those characteristics of the system that are responsible for long term stability and asymptotic damping of the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Region of Attraction Estimate Learning and Verification for Nonlinear Systems using Neural-Network-based Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the Region of Attraction (RoA) for nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental problem in control theory, with direct implications for stability analysis and safe controller design. Traditional approaches rely on analytically derived Lyapunov functions, which are often conservative and challenging to construct for high-dimensional or highly nonlinear systems. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for learning and verifying RoA estimates for nonlinear systems using neural-network-based Lyapunov functions. Our method employs a composite Lyapunov function that combines a quadratic term with a neural-network-based component, providing both structure and flexibility. We introduce a novel homogeneous loss function for training, which removes the imbalance typically caused by the two non-homogeneous Lyapunov conditions. Together, these two aspects enable efficient training of the Lyapunov candidate. To guarantee the correctness of the learned Lyapunov function, we employ a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to formally verify the stability results. Lastly, we perform a deeper analysis near the origin to overcome numerical artifacts, ensuring strict asymptotic stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark nonlinear systems, showing that it significantly reduces conservatism compared to traditional Lyapunov methods while maintaining verifiability. This framework bridges the gap between function approximation and stability certification, paving the way for scalable safety analysis in learning-based control and safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Smoothness and Dynamics in an SEIR$^{\text{T}}$R$^{\text{P}}$D Endemic Model with Distributed Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the properties of an SEIR$^{\text{T}}$R$^{\text{P}}$D endemic model expressed through delay-differential equations with distributed delays for latency and temporary immunity. Our research delves into the variability of latent periods and immunity durations across diseases, in particular, we introduce a class of delays defined by continuous integral kernels with compact support. The main result of the paper is a kind of smoothening property which the solution function posesses under mild conditions of the system parameter functions. Also, boundedness and non-negativity is proved. Numerical simulations indicates that the continuous model can be approximated with a discrete lag endemic models. The study contributes to understanding infectious disease dynamics and provides insights into the numerical approximation of exact solution for different delay scenarios.</description>

      <title>Risk averse deterministic Kalman filters for uncertain dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking a deterministic viewpoint this work investigates extensions of the Kalman-Bucy filter for state reconstruction to systems containing parametric uncertainty in the state operator. The emphasis lies on risk averse designs reducing the probability of large reconstruction errors. In a theoretical analysis error bounds in terms of the variance of the uncertainties are derived. The article concludes with a numerical implementation of two examples allowing for a comparison of risk neutral and risk averse estimators.</description>

      <title>Global attractor for a Cahn-Hilliard-chemotaxis model with logistic degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a mathematical model coupling the Cahn-Hilliard system for phase separation with an additional equation describing the diffusion process of a chemical quantity whose concentration influences the physical process. The main application of the model refers to tumor progression, where the phase variable denotes the local proportion of active cancer cells and the chemical concentration may refer to a nutrient transported by the blood flow or to a drug administered to the patient. The resulting system is characterized by cross-diffusion effects similar to those appearing in the Keller-Segel model for chemotaxis; in particular, the nutrient tends to be attracted towards the regions where more active tumor cells are present (and consume it in a quickier way). Complementing various recent results on related models, we investigate here the long-time behavior of solutions under the perspective of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. To this aim, we first identify a regularity setting in which the system is well posed and generates a closed semigroup according to the terminology introduced by Pata and Zelik. Then, partly based on the approach introduced by Rocca and the first author for the Cahn-Hilliard system with singular potential, we prove that the semigroup is strongly dissipative and asymptotically compact so guaranteeing the existence of the global attractor in a suitable phase space. Finally, we discuss the sign properties of the nutrient and prove that, under additional assumptions on the initial data, its concentration is uniformly larger than some strictly positive constant at least on finite time intervals.</description>

      <title>Multistability of Self-Attention Dynamics in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.</description>

      <title>On the stability of Rotating States in Second-Order Self-Propelled Multi-Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of a system of $n$ coupled, self-propelled particles: $\ddot r_k = (\alpha-\beta |\dot r_k|^2)\dot r_k - \frac{\gamma}{n}\sum_{m=1}^n(r_k-r_m)$, $r_k\in \mathbb R^2.$ Numerical experiments indicate that, for a large set of initial conditions, after an initial drift, the center of mass converges to a stationary point, with each particle eventually rotating around it with constant angular velocity. The distribution of particles on the circle need not be uniform. These limit configurations, where all particles rotate in the same direction, are termed {\it rotating states} . We prove that rotating states are stable and that every solution that starts sufficiently close, asymptotically approaches a rotating state, exponentially fast if $n$ is odd, or at a rate that may be exponential or $\frac{1}{\sqrt t} $ if $n$ is even. The proof uses a new approximation technique for the flow on the center manifold in the presence of non-isolated fixed points.</description>

      <title>A Flat Triangular Structure Based on a Multi-Chained Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining whether a nonlinear multi-input system is differentially flat remains challenging. One way to obtain computationally tractable sufficient conditions is to give complete characterizations of flat normal forms. We introduce a structurally flat triangular form for control-affine systems with at least three inputs that is based on a multi-chained form. For two specific instances of this structure, we provide complete geometric characterizations, i.e., necessary and sufficient conditions under which a control-affine system is static-feedback equivalent to the respective triangular form. These characterizations yield sufficient conditions for differential flatness and, in turn, constructive procedures for computing flat outputs.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{S}$ be an iterated function system in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with full support and some restrictions on the allowable rotations. We show that $\mathcal{S}$ satisfies the weak separation condition if and only if it satisfies the generalized finite-type condition. With this in mind, we extend the notion of net intervals from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also use net intervals to calculate the local dimension of a self-similar measure with the finite-type condition and full support.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of hyperbolic Busemann functions in the Newtonian N-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the N-body problem we prove that any two hyperbolic rays having the same limit shape define the same Busemann function. We localize a region of differentiability for these functions, of which we know that they are viscosity solutions of the stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation. As a first corollary, we deduce that every hyperbolic motion of the $N$-body problem must become, after some time, a calibrating curve for the Busemann function associated to its limit shape. This implies that every hyperbolic motionof the $N$-body problem is eventually a minimizer, that is, it must contain a geodesic ray of the Jacobi-Maupertuis metric. Since the viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation are almost everywhere differentiable, we also deduce the generic uniqueness of geodesic rays with a given limit shape without collisions. That is to say, if the limit shape is given, then for almost every initial configuration the geodesic ray is unique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k\leq n/2$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension \(n\), then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This result addresses a longstanding question by Baum and Bott regarding the functoriality of residues. Also, This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville-Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $ r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2 $</description>

      <title>Plankton-Oxygen Dynamics in the Context of Climate Change: A Fractional Model with A Probability Density Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze how climate change affects marine oxygen production by modeling plankton--oxygen dynamics with a fractional-order nonlinear system and establishing rigorous conditions for the model's well-posedness. We formulate a three-dimensional system $d^\alpha x(t)/dt^\alpha = A x(t) + f(x(t))$, where $A$ is a diagonal $3\times 3$ matrix and $f$ is nonlinear. We (i) rigorously state the model, (ii) derive a Lipschitz constant for $f$ under suitable assumptions, and (iii) prove existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data using a fractional formula with a probability density kernel and a generalized Gr"onwall inequality. Under the stated conditions, $f$ satisfies a computable Lipschitz bound that yields existence and uniqueness of solutions for the fractional system, and the solutions depend continuously on initial conditions, establishing the well-posedness of the plankton--oxygen model. We introduce a fractional, PDF-kernel--based framework for plankton--oxygen dynamics and provide general proofs of well-posedness via a generalized Gr"onwall approach, capturing memory effects that classical integer-order models miss. These results justify numerical simulations and sensitivity analyses of fractional marine-ecosystem models, providing a sound basis for testing mitigation and management strategies affecting oxygen dynamics and supporting evidence-based policies for protecting marine ecosystems under global warming.</description>
