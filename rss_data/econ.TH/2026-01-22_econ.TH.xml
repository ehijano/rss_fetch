      <title>An $\Omega(\log(N)/N)$ Lookahead is Sufficient to Bound Costs in the Overloaded Loss Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14538v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the simplest model of revenue management with reusable resources: admission control of two customer classes into a loss queue. This model's long-run average collected reward has two natural upper bounds: the deterministic relaxation and the full-information offline problem. With these bounds, we can decompose the costs faced by the online decision maker into (i) the \emph{cost of variability}, given by the difference between the deterministic value and the offline value, and (ii) the \emph{cost of uncertainty}, given by the difference between the offline value and the online value. \cite{Xie2025} established that the sum of these two costs is $\Theta(\log N)$, as the number of servers, $N$, goes to infinity. I show that we can entirely attribute this $\Theta(\log N)$ rate to the cost of uncertainty, as the cost of variability remains $O(1)$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. In other words, I show that anticipating future fluctuations is sufficient to bound operating costs -- smoothing out these fluctuations is unnecessary. In fact, I show that an $\Omega(\log(N)/N)$ lookahead window is sufficient to bound operating costs.</description>

      <title>Economic feasibility of virtual operators in 5G via network slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The provision of services by more than one operator over a common network infrastructure, as enabled by 5G network slicing, is analyzed. Two business models to be implemented by a network operator, who owns the network, and a virtual operator, who does not, are proposed. In one business model, named \emph{strategic}, the network operator provides service to its user base and the virtual operator provides service to its user base and pays a per-subscriber fee to the network operator. In the other business model, named \emph{monopolistic}, the network operator provides service to both user bases. The two proposals are analyzed by means of a model that captures both system and economic features. As regards the systems features, the slicing of the network is modeled by means of a Discriminatory Processor Sharing queue. As regards the economic features, the incentives are modeled by means of the user utilities and the operators' revenues; and game theory is used to model the strategic interaction between the users' subscription decision and the operators' pricing decision. In both business models, it is shown that the network operator can be provided with the appropriate economic incentives so that it acquiesces in serving the virtual operator's user base (monopolistic model) and in allowing the virtual operator to provide service over the network operator's infrastructure (strategic model). From the point of view of the users, the strategic model results in a higher subscription rate than the monopolistic model.</description>

      <title>Smart contracts and reaction-function games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain-based smart contracts offer a new take on credible commitment, where players can commit to actions in reaction to actions of others. Such reaction-function games extend on strategic games with players choosing reaction functions instead of strategies. We formalize a solution concept in terms of fixed points for such games, akin to Nash equilibrium, and prove equilibrium existence. Reaction functions can mimic "trigger" strategies from folk theorems on infinitely repeated games -- but now in a one-shot setting -- for instance to support Pareto-improvements on Nash equilibrium outcomes. In some games, this can even be done through risk-free, safe reaction functions. We apply our theoretical framework to symmetric investment games, which includes two prominent classes of games, namely weakest-link and public-good games. In both cases, we highlight a particular safe and optimal reaction function. In this way, our findings highlight how blockchain-based commitment can help overcome trust and free-riding barriers.</description>
