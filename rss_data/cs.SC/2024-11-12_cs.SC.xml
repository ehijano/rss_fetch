      <title>Case Frames and Case-Based Arguments in Statutory Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel conceptual Case Frame model that represents the content of cases involving statutory interpretation within civil law frameworks, accompanied by an associated argument scheme enriched with critical questions. By validating our approach with a modest dataset, we demonstrate its robustness and practical applicability. Our model not only provides a structured method for analyzing statutory interpretation but also highlights the distinct needs of lawyers operating under statutory law compared to those reasoning with common law precedents. The model presented here is a step towards developing a hybrid Machine Learning and Argumentation system that includes a module for constructing well-structured arguments from textual datasets.</description>

      <title>Guiding Genetic Programming with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In evolutionary computation, it is commonly assumed that a search algorithm acquires knowledge about a problem instance by sampling solutions from the search space and evaluating them with a fitness function. This is necessarily inefficient because fitness reveals very little about solutions -- yet they contain more information that can be potentially exploited. To address this observation in genetic programming, we propose EvoNUDGE, which uses a graph neural network to elicit additional knowledge from symbolic regression problems. The network is queried on the problem before an evolutionary run to produce a library of subprograms, which is subsequently used to seed the initial population and bias the actions of search operators. In an extensive experiment on a large number of problem instances, EvoNUDGE is shown to significantly outperform multiple baselines, including the conventional tree-based genetic programming and the purely neural variant of the method.</description>

      <title>Learning Interpretable Network Dynamics via Universal Neural Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations of complex network dynamics is a fundamental challenge in contemporary science with rich data, which can uncover the mysterious patterns and mechanisms of the formation and evolution of complex phenomena in various fields and assist in decision-making. In this work, we develop a universal computational tool that can automatically, efficiently, and accurately learn the symbolic changing patterns of complex system states by combining the excellent fitting ability from deep learning and the equation inference ability from pre-trained symbolic regression. We conduct intensive experimental verifications on more than ten representative scenarios from physics, biochemistry, ecology, epidemiology, etc. Results demonstrate the outstanding effectiveness and efficiency of our tool by comparing with the state-of-the-art symbolic regression techniques for network dynamics. The application to real-world systems including global epidemic transmission and pedestrian movements has verified its practical applicability. We believe that our tool can serve as a universal solution to dispel the fog of hidden mechanisms of changes in complex phenomena, advance toward interpretability, and inspire more scientific discoveries.</description>
