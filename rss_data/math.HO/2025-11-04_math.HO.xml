      <title>Asymptotics of the Longest Increasing Subsequence in Random Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in a uniformly random permutation of $n$ elements. We rely on the Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence, Young tableaux, and key classical results -- including the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem and the Hook Length Formula -- to demonstrate that the expected LIS length grows as $2\sqrt{n}$. We review the essential variational principles of Logan--Shepp and Vershik--Kerov, which determine the limiting shape of the associated random Young diagrams, and summarize the Baik--Deift--Johansson theorem that links fluctuations of the LIS length to the Tracy--Widom distribution. Our approach focuses on providing conceptual and intuitive explanations of these results, unifying classical proofs into a single narrative and supplying fresh visual examples, while referring the reader to the original literature for detailed proofs and rigorous arguments.</description>

      <title>The Orientalists' Stance Towards Arabic Sciences (Especially Arabic Astronomy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we highlight the influence of Arab/Islamic civilization in the field of the history of astronomy on European historians. We also aim to elucidate the stance of Orientalists toward the study of Arab sciences and to clarify their orientations, with a particular focus on astronomy, while revealing the significant role played by Arab scholars in this domain and the impact of their contributions-especially astronomical tables (zij)-on Western astronomers. Furthermore, we have clarified the mechanisms of transmission of Arab sciences, particularly astronomy, from Arab scholars to Western scholars, and the role of Arab astronomers in Western civilization. In addition, we address the contributions of Arab scholars to the development of astronomy and the perspective of Orientalists, particularly David King, regarding this matter. We also underscore the importance of Orientalists' works in analyzing Arab/Islamic scholarly output, identifying its influence on the West in the field of astronomy, and demonstrating how Western scholars benefited from translations of Arabic books in this discipline. In this paper, we adopt the historical retrieval methodology, by referencing previously documented astronomical information and contributions, with an emphasis on the processes of transmission of these sciences from the Arabs to the West.</description>
