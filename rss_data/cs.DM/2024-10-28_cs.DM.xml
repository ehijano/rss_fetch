      <title>Paths and Intersections: Characterization of Quasi-metrics in Directed Okamura-Seymour Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the following distance realization problem. Given a quasi-metric $D$ on a set $T$ of terminals, does there exist a directed Okamura-Seymour graph that realizes $D$ as the (directed) shortest-path distance metric on $T$? We show that, if we are further given the circular ordering of terminals lying on the boundary, then Monge property is a sufficient and necessary condition. This generalizes previous results for undirected Okamura-Seymour instances.
  With the circular ordering, we give a greedy algorithm for constructing a directed Okamura-Seymour instance that realizes the input quasi-metric. The algorithm takes the dual perspective concerning flows and routings, and is based on a new way of analyzing graph structures, by viewing graphs as \emph{paths and their intersections}. We believe this new understanding is of independent interest and will prove useful in other problems in graph theory and graph algorithms.
  We also design an efficient algorithm for finding such a circular ordering that makes $D$ satisfy Monge property, if one exists. Combined with our result above, this gives an efficient algorithm for the distance realization problem.</description>

      <title>An explicit condition for boundedly supermultiplicative subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study some properties of the growth rate of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$, that is, the language of words over the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ avoiding the set of forbidden factors $\mathcal{F}$. We first provide a sufficient condition on $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ for the growth of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$ to be boundedly supermultiplicative. That is, there exist constants $C&gt;0$ and $\alpha\ge0$, such that for all $n$, the number of words of length $n$ in $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$ is between $\alpha^n$ and $C\alpha^n$. In some settings, our condition provides a way to compute $C$, which implies that $\alpha$, the growth rate of the language, is also computable whenever our condition holds.
  We also apply our technique to the specific setting of power-free words where the argument can be slightly refined to provide better bounds. Finally, we apply a similar idea to $\mathcal{F}$-free circular words and in particular we make progress toward a conjecture of Shur about the number of square-free circular words.</description>

      <title>Decision-Making Frameworks for Network Resilience -- Managing and Mitigating Systemic (Cyber) Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a decision-making framework tailored for the management of systemic risk in networks. This framework is constructed upon three fundamental components: (1) a set of acceptable network configurations, (2) a set of interventions aimed at risk mitigation, and (3) a cost function quantifying the expenses associated with these interventions. While our discussion primarily revolves around the management of systemic cyber risks in digital networks, we concurrently draw parallels to risk management of other complex systems where analogous approaches may be adequate.</description>

      <title>Grand zigzag knight's paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of different classes of grand knight's paths in the plane. In particular, we focus on the subsets of zigzag knight's paths that are subject to constraints. These constraints include ending at $y$-coordinate 0, bounded by a horizontal line, confined within a tube, among other considerations. We present our results using generating functions or direct closed-form expressions. We derive asymptotic results, finding approximations for quantities such as the probability that a zigzag knight's path stays in some area of the plane, or for the average of the altitude of such a path. Additionally, we exhibit some bijections between grand zigzag knight's paths and some pairs of compositions.</description>

      <title>Locally seeded embeddings, and Ramsey numbers of bipartite graphs with sublinear bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seminal result of Lee asserts that the Ramsey number of any bipartite $d$-degenerate graph $H$ satisfies $\log r(H) = \log n + O(d)$. In particular, this bound applies to every bipartite graph of maximal degree $\Delta$. It remains a compelling challenge to identify conditions that guarantee that an $n$-vertex graph $H$ has Ramsey number linear in $n$, independently of $\Delta$. Our contribution is a characterization of bipartite graphs with linear-size Ramsey numbers in terms of graph bandwidth, a notion of local connectivity. We prove that for any $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ with maximal degree at most $\Delta$ and bandwidth $b(H)$ at most $\exp(-C\Delta\log\Delta)\,n$, we have $\log r(H) = \log n + O(1)$. This characterization is nearly optimal: for every $\Delta$ there exists an $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ of degree at most $\Delta$ and $b(H) \leq \exp(-c\Delta)\,n$, such that $\log r(H) = \log n + \Omega(\Delta)$. We also provide bounds interpolating between these two bandwidth regimes.</description>
