      <title>Failure of the comformal-map method for relativistic quantum billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the conformal-map method introduced by Robnik in 1984 for nonrelativistic quantum billiards is not applicable for the quantization of relativistic neutrino billiards (NBs) consisting of a massless non-interacting spin-1/2 particle confined to a two-dimensional domain. To be precise, we demonstrate in this work, that this method does not provide solutions of the associated Weyl (Dirac) equation, nor does it fulfill the boundary conditions imposed on the spinor eigenfunctions to ensure confinement of the particle to the domain of the billiard. We review in detail the wave equation, boundary conditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to make the proof comprehensible for the general reader. Our results are corroborated with numerical results for non-relativistic and relativistic quantum billiards whose shapes depend on a parameter, which allows the study of the properties of their eigenstates as the classical dynamics experiences a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Metastable Turbulence in Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The onset of turbulence in pipe flow has been a fundamental challenge in physics, applied mathematics, and engineering for over 140 years. To date, the precursor of this laminar-turbulent transition is recognized as transient turbulent spots or puffs, but their defining characteristics - longevity, abrupt relaminarization, and super-exponential lifetime scaling - have been lack of first-principles explanations. By combining extensive computer simulations, theory, and verifications with experimental data, we identify distinct puff relaminarizations separated by a critical Reynolds number, which are defined by a noisy saddle-node bifurcation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Below the critical number, the mean lifetime of puff follows a square-root scaling law, representing an intrinsically deterministic decay dominated by the critical slowing down. Above the critical value, the bifurcation's node branch creates a potential well stabilizing the turbulence, while the saddle branch mediates stochastic barrier-crossing events that drive memoryless decay - a hallmark of metastable states. Accordingly, the mean lifetimes are solved theoretically and can be fitted super-exponentially. By quantifying the deterministic and stochastic components in the kinetic energy equation, the lifetime statistics of puff are analyzed in a unified framework across low-to-moderate Reynolds number regimes, uncovering the mechanisms governing the transition to metastable turbulence in pipe flows.</description>

      <title>Chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.02017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence driven by nonlinear wave-particle resonance coupling. Turbulent waves with distinct characteristic wavelengths across scales coherently interact with charged particles when their phase velocities match the particles' velocities. A multi-wavenumber mapping framework is developed to model chaotic transport under multi-scale turbulence. By analytically deriving velocity correlation functions, we quantify the diffusion coefficient under conditions of cross-scale wave intensity parity. A critical analysis reveals that chaotic dynamics at smaller scales prove insufficient to completely erase phase-space correlations established by large-scale turbulent components. The largest-scale turbulence components dominate deviations from quasi-linear (QL) theory predictions, establishing a scale-dependent hierarchy in chaotic transport. Mere reduction of inter-wave phase velocity spacing for small-scale components cannot recover QL diffusion at finite wave amplitudes in multi-scale turbulence. Incorporating a larger-scale component into a small-scale-driven strong chaotic system can induce non-QL diffusion. Specifically, for two-scale turbulence, the QL approximation systematically underestimates transport. Increasing the number of smaller-scale components with strong overlap parameters drives convergence toward the QL approximation. This framework provides a methodology for analyzing resonance-driven turbulence in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Impact of dynamics, entanglement, and Markovian noise on the fidelity of few-qubit digital quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have been proposed to accelerate the simulation of the chaotic dynamical systems that are ubiquitous in the physics of plasmas. Quantum computers without error correction might even use noise to their advantage to calculate the Lyapunov exponent by measuring the Loschmidt echo fidelity decay rate. For the first time, digital Hamiltonian simulations of the quantum sawtooth map, performed on the {IBM-Q} quantum hardware platform, show that the fidelity decay rate of a digital quantum simulation increases during the transition from dynamical localization to chaotic diffusion in the map. The observed error per \code{CNOT} gate increases by $1.5\times$ as the dynamics varies from localized to diffusive, while only changing the phases of virtual \code{RZ} gates and keeping the over-all gate count constant. A gate-based Lindblad noise model that captures the effective change in relaxation and dephasing errors during gate operation qualitatively explains the effect of dynamics on fidelity as being due to the localization and entanglement of the states created. Specifically, highly delocalized states that are entangled with random phases show an increased sensitivity to dephasing and, on average, a similar sensitivity to relaxation as localized states. In contrast, delocalized unentangled states show an increased sensitivity to dephasing but a lower sensitivity to relaxation. This gate-based Lindblad model is shown to be a useful benchmarking tool by estimating the effective Lindblad coherence times during \code{CNOT} gates and finding a consistent $2\text{--}3\times$ shorter $T_2$ time than reported for idle qubits. Thus, the interplay of the dynamics of a simulation with the noise processes that are active can strongly influence the overall fidelity decay rate.</description>

      <title>What is the graph of a dynamical system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some of the basic properties of any dynamical system can be summarized by a graph. The dynamical systems in our theory run from maps like the logistic map to ordinary differential equations to dissipative partial differential equations. Our goal has been to define a meaningful concept of graph of any dynamical system. As a result, we base our definition of ``chain graph'' on ``epsilon-chains'', defining both nodes and edges of the graph in terms of chains. In particular, nodes are often maximal limit sets and there is an edge between two nodes if there is a trajectory whose forward limit set is in one node and its backward limit set is in the other. Our initial goal was to prove that every ``chain graph'' of a dynamical system is, in some sense, connected, and we prove connectedness under mild hypotheses.</description>
