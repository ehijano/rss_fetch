      <title>Hyperbolic Geometry and the Helfrich Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Helfrich model is a fundamental tool for determining the morphology of biological membranes. We relate the geometry of an important class of its equilibria to the geometry of sessile and pendant drops in the hyperbolic space ${\bf H}^3$. When the membrane surface meets the ideal boundary of hyperbolic space, a modification of the regularized area functional is related to the construction of closed equilibria for the Helfrich functional in ${\bf R}^3$.</description>

      <title>A characterization of Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds in locally conformally K\"{a}hler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a certain class of solvable Lie groups, if they admit a left-invariant non-Vaisman locally conformally K\"{a}hler metric and a lattice, they must arise from the construction of Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds. This result provides a natural explanation for why number-theoretic considerations play a role in the construction of Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued extension of mean curvature for surfaces in Riemann-Cartan geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the framework of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry to Riemann-Cartan geometry, which addresses connections with torsion. This procedure naturally introduces a 2-form on submanifolds associated with the nontrivial ambient torsion, whose Hodge dual plays the role of an imaginary counterpart to mean curvature for surfaces in a Riemann-Cartan 3-manifold. We observe that this complex-valued geometric quantity interacts with a number of other geometric concepts including the Hopf differential and the Gauss map, which generalizes classical minimal surface theory.</description>

      <title>On the variety of Lie algebras endowed with complex structures: degenerations and deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the space of Lie algebras equipped with left-invariant complex structures, $\mathcal{L}_{ J_{\tiny{\mbox{cn}}} }(\mathbb{R}^{2n}) $, with particular attention to their degenerations and deformations. To this end, we identify certain invariants that remain well-behaved under degenerations while preserving the complex structure. These concepts are then applied to the four-dimensional case. Additionally, we explore applications to the study of left-invariant Hermitian structures on Lie groups, and we discuss some aspects of the deformation theory within $ \mathcal{L}_{ J_{\tiny{\mbox{cn}}} }(\mathbb{R}^{2n}) $.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for Willmore flows of tori: fixed conformal class and analysis of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies Willmore flows of tori and their singularities via a dimension reduction approach. We introduce a Willmore flow that preserves the degenerate constraint of prescribed conformal class and, for rotationally symmetric initial data, we establish a strong relation with the length-preserving elastic flow in the hyperbolic plane. We provide a necessary condition for singularities and a criterion for the initial datum that allows to exclude them. Our results allow for initial data with arbitrarily large energy, in particular exceeding the usual Li-Yau threshold of $8\pi$. As an application, we obtain existence of a new class of conformally constrained Willmore tori. Moreover, we investigate singularities of the classical Willmore flow. For a class of tori, we identify a non-smooth object, the inverted catenoid, as the limit shape and we show that the flow can be restarted at this singular surface and converges to a round sphere.</description>

      <title>Towards Variational Flow Matching on General Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Riemannian Gaussian Variational Flow Matching (RG-VFM), an extension of Variational Flow Matching (VFM) that leverages Riemannian Gaussian distributions for generative modeling on structured manifolds. We derive a variational objective for probability flows on manifolds with closed-form geodesics, making RG-VFM comparable - though fundamentally different to Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM) in this geometric setting. Experiments on a checkerboard dataset wrapped on the sphere demonstrate that RG-VFM captures geometric structure more effectively than Euclidean VFM and baseline methods, establishing it as a robust framework for manifold-aware generative modeling.</description>

      <title>AInstein: Numerical Einstein Metrics via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant, without any symmetry assumptions. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in that patch, with the associated Einstein conditions, of the form $R_{\mu \nu} - \lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 0$, being used as independent loss components; in our conventions, $\mu,\nu = 1, 2, \cdots, n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold and $\lambda \in \{+1, 0, -1\}$. To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, $ g' = J g J^T$, for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian $J$. We test our method for the case of spheres represented with 2 patches in dimensions $2,3,4,5$; in dimensions $2, 3$ the geometries have been fully classified, however it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can be put on spheres in dimensions $4, 5$, which we provide numerical evidence against.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish lower bounds for the sum of the reciprocals of eigenvalues of the Laplacian. For bounded domains, our result extends the upper bound provided by Bucur and Henrot on the second Neumann eigenvalue and is related to a result by Wang and Xia, which connects to a conjecture of Ashbaugh and Benguria. For spheres and surfaces, we extend known results on the first and second eigenvalues, and strengthen an analogous conjecture involving the conformal volume of Li and Yau.</description>

      <title>Hardy--Littlewood maximal operators on certain manifolds with bounded geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the $L^p$ boundedness of the centred and the uncentred Hardy--Littlewood maximal operators on certain Riemannian manifolds with bounded geometry. Our results complement those of various authors. We show that, under mild assumptions, $L^p$ estimates for the centred operator are ``stable'' under conformal changes of the metric, and prove sharp~$L^p$ estimates for the centred operator on Riemannian models with pinched negative scalar curvature. Furthermore, we prove that the centred operator is of weak type $(1,1)$ on the connected sum of two space forms with negative curvature, whereas the uncentred operator is, perhaps surprisingly, bounded only on $L^\infty$. We also prove that if two locally doubling geodesic metric measure spaces enjoying the uniform ball size condition are strictly quasi-isometric, then they share the same boundedness properties for both the centred and the uncentred maximal operator. Finally, we discuss some $L^p$ mapping properties for the centred operator on a specific Riemannian surface introduced by Str\"omberg, providing new interesting results.</description>

Abstract: We study the notion of optical geometry, defined to be a Lorentzian manifold equipped with a null line distribution, from the perspective of intrinsic torsion. This is an instance of a non-integrable version of holonomy reduction in Lorentzian geometry. These generate congruences of null curves, which play an important r\^{o}le in general relativity. Conformal properties of these are investigated. We also extend this concept to generalised optical geometries as introduced by Robinson and Trautman.</description>

Abstract: We consider the localisation of the 2-category of diffeological groupoids at weak equivalences from the perspective of anafunctors, and with this language, prove that the localisation of the 2-category of Lie groupoids is an essentially full sub-bicategory of that of diffeological groupoids. In particular, we solve the open problem affirmatively of whether two Lie groupoids that are diffeologically Morita equivalent are Morita equivalent in the usual Lie sense.</description>

Abstract: One primary objective in submanifold geometry is to discover fascinating and significant classical examples of $H_1$. In this paper which relies on the theory we established in [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), 08514, 50 pages, arXiv:2101.11780] and utilizing the approach we provided for constructing constant $p$-mean curvature surfaces, we have identified intriguing examples of such surfaces. Notably, we present a complete description of rotationally invariant surfaces of constant $p$-mean curvature and shed light on the geometric interpretation of the energy $E$ with a lower bound.</description>

      <title>The renormalization of volume and Chern-Simons invariant for hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We renormalize the Chern-Simons invariant for convex-cocompact hyperbolic 3-manifolds by finding the asymptotics along an equidistance foliation. We prove that the metric Chern-Simons invariant has an exponentially divergent term given by the integral of the torsion 2-form with respect to a Weitzenb\"ock connection. This produces the asymptotics of hyperbolic volume plus the metric Chern-Simons invariant, which is often called complex volume. The leading coefficient of the asymptotics introduces a complex-valued quantity consisting of mean curvature and torsion 2-form, which is defined on smooth surfaces embedded in a Riemann-Cartan 3-manifold.</description>

  As a byproduct, it is shown that the finiteness result for the space of harmonic functions with polynomial growth on manifolds in \cite{CM97} and \cite{Li97} are essentially sharp, except for the multi-end cases, addressing an issue raised in \cite{CM98} and removing all {\it local} topological or geometric conditions on the manifold with respect to a reference point.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Cartan calculus, the Patterson-Walker metric and symmetric cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop symmetric Cartan calculus, an analogue of classical Cartan calculus for symmetric differential forms. We first show that the analogue of the exterior derivative, the symmetric derivative, is not unique and its different choices are parametrized by torsion-free affine connections. We use a choice of symmetric derivative to generate the symmetric bracket and the symmetric Lie derivative, and give geometric interpretations of all of them. By proving the structural identities and describing the role of affine morphisms, we reveal an unexpected link of symmetric Cartan calculus with the Patterson-Walker metric, which we recast as a direct analogue of the canonical symplectic form on the cotangent bundle. We show that, in the light of the Patterson-Walker metric, symmetric Cartan calculus becomes a complete analogue of classical Cartan calculus. As an application of this new framework, we introduce symmetric cohomology, which involves Killing tensors, or, in the case of the Levi-Civita connection, Killing vector fields. We characterize the Levi-Civita connections of $\mathrm{S}^1$ in terms of symmetric cohomology and develop further techniques.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses the long-standing open problem regarding the existence of a Riemannian metric on $ S^2 \times T^2 $ with strictly positive biorthogonal curvature: "Does $S^2 \times T^2$ admit a Riemannian metric with positive biorthogonal curvature?". Biorthogonal curvature, defined as the average of the sectional curvatures of a plane and its orthogonal complement, represents an intermediate condition between positive sectional curvature and positive scalar curvature. By rigorously analyzing topological and geometric constraints, we show the existence of such a metric.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Lie-Poisson discretization for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics on the sphere</title>

Abstract: We give a structure preserving spatio-temporal discretization for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on the sphere. Discretization in space is based on the theory of geometric quantization, which yields a spatially discretized analogue of the MHD equations as a finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson system on the dual of the magnetic extension Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{su}(N)\ltimes\mathfrak{su}(N)^{*}$. We also give accompanying structure preserving time discretizations for Lie--Poisson systems on the dual of semi-direct product Lie algebras of the form $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{g}\ltimes\mathfrak{g^{*}}$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a $J$-quadratic Lie algebra. The time integration method is free of computationally costly matrix exponentials. We prove that the full method preserves a modified Lie--Poisson structure and corresponding Casimir functions, and that the modified structure and Casimirs converge to the continuous ones. The method is demonstrated for two models of magnetic fluids: incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and Hazeltine's model.</description>

      <title>Direct derivation of $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions to all orders in fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that generalised geometry provides a particularly elegant rewriting of the action and symmetries of 10-dimensional supergravity theories, up to the lowest nontrivial order in fermions. By exhibiting the full symmetry calculations in the second-order formalism, we show in the $\mathcal N=1$ case that this analysis can be upgraded to all orders in fermions and we obtain a strikingly simple form of the action as well as of the supersymmetry transformations, featuring overall only five higher-fermionic terms. Surprisingly, even after expressing the action in terms of classical (non-generalised geometric) variables one obtains a simplification of the usual formulae. This in particular confirms that generalised geometry provides the natural set of variables for studying (the massless level of) string theory. We also show how this new reformulation implies the compatibility of the Poisson-Lie T-duality with the equations of motion of the full supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Compactification of homology cells, Fujita's conjectures and the complex projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a compact K\"ahler manifold $M$ containing a smooth connected divisor $D$ such that $M \setminus D$ is a homology cell, e.g., contractible, must be projective space with $D$ a hyperplane, provided $\dim M \not \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. This answers conjectures of Fujita in these dimensions.</description>
