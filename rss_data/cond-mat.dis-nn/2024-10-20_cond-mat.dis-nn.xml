      <title>Equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium critical dynamics of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model with random cubic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical dynamics of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model with random cubic anisotropy in the out-of-equilibrium and equilibrium regimes. Analytical approaches based on field theory predict that the universality class of this model is that of the three-dimensional site-diluted Ising model. We have been able to estimate the dynamic critical exponent by working in the equilibrium regime and by computing the integrated autocorrelation times obtaining $z=2.50(5)$ (free scaling corrections) and $z=2.31(7)$ (by fixing the scaling corrections to that of the 3D site-diluted Ising model). In the out-of-equilibrium regime we have focused in the study of the dynamic correlation length which has allowed us to compute the dynamic critical exponent obtaining $z=2.38(2)$, which is compatible with the equilibrium ones. Finally, both estimates are also compatible with the most accurate prediction $z=2.35(2)$ from numerical simulations of the 3D site-diluted Ising model, in agreement with the predictions based on field theory.</description>

      <title>Local Density of States Correlations in the L\'evy-Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical calculation of the local density of states correlation function $ \beta(\omega) $ in the L\'evy-Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble at energy scales larger than the level spacing but smaller than the bandwidth. The only relevant energy scale in this limit is the typical level width $\Gamma_0$. We show that $\beta(\omega \ll \Gamma_0) \sim W/\Gamma_0$ (here $W$ is width of the band) whereas $\beta(\omega \gg \Gamma_0) \sim (W/\Gamma_0) (\omega/\Gamma_0)^{-\mu} $ where $\mu$ is an index characterising the distribution of the matrix elements. We also provide an expression for the average return probability at long times: $\ln [R(t\gg\Gamma_0^{-1})] \sim -(\Gamma_0 t)^{\mu/2}$. Numerical results based on the pool method and exact diagonalization are also provided and are in agreement with the analytical theory.</description>

      <title>Generic non-Hermitian mobility edges in a class of duality-breaking quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide approximate solutions for the mobility edge (ME) that demarcates localized and extended states within a specific class of one-dimensional non-Hermitian (NH) quasicrystals. These NH quasicrystals exhibit a combination of nonreciprocal hopping terms and complex quasiperiodic on-site potentials. Our analytical approach is substantiated by rigorous numerical calculations, demonstrating significant accuracy. Furthermore, our ansatz closely agrees with the established limiting cases of the NH Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper (AAH) and Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma (GPD) models, which have exact results, thereby enhancing its credibility. Additionally, we have examined their dynamic properties and discovered distinct behaviors in different regimes. Our research provides a practical methodology for estimating the position of MEs in a category of NH quasicrystals that break duality.</description>

      <title>Influence of anisotropy on the study of critical behavior of spin models by machine learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we applied a deep neural network to study the issue of knowledge transferability between statistical mechanics models. The following computer experiment was conducted. A convolutional neural network was trained to solve the problem of binary classification of snapshots of the Ising model's spin configuration on a two-dimensional lattice. During testing, snapshots of the Ising model spins on a lattice with diagonal ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic connections were fed to the input of the neural network. Estimates of the probability of samples belonging to the paramagnetic phase were obtained from the outputs of the tested network. The analysis of these probabilities allowed us to estimate the critical temperature and the critical correlation length exponent. It turned out that at weak anisotropy the neural network satisfactorily predicts the transition point and the value of the correlation length exponent. Strong anisotropy leads to a noticeable deviation of the predicted values from the precisely known ones. Qualitatively, strong anisotropy is associated with the presence of oscillations of the correlation function above the Stephenson disorder temperature and further approach to the point of the fully frustrated case.</description>

      <title>Saddles-to-minima topological crossover and glassiness in the Rubik's Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow relaxation and glassiness have been the focus of extensive research attention, along with popular and technological interest, for many decades. While much understanding has been attained through mean-field and mode-coupling models, energy landscape paradigms, and real-space descriptions of dynamical heterogeneities and facilitation, a complete framework about the origins and existence of a glass transition is yet to be achieved. In this work we propose a discrete model glass-former, inspired by the famous Rubik's Cube, where these questions can be answered with surprising depth. By introducing a swap-move Monte Carlo algorithm, we are able to access thermal equilibrium states above and below the temperature of dynamical arrest. Exploiting the discreteness of the model, we probe directly the energy-resolved connectivity structure of the model, and we uncover a saddles-to-minima topological crossover underpinning the slowing down and eventual arrest of the dynamics. We demonstrate that the smooth behaviour in finite-size systems tends asymptotically to a sharp step-change in the thermodynamic limit, identifying a well-defined energy threshold where the onset of stretched exponential behaviour and the dynamical arrest come to coincide. Our results allow us to shed light on the origin of the glassy behaviour, and how this is resolved by changing connectivity upon introducing swap-moves.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional many-body localized systems coupled to a heat bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of coupling a two-dimensional many-body localized system to a finite heat bath, using shallow quantum circuits as a variational ansatz. Specifically, we simulate optical lattice experiments with two components of ultracold bosons, where only one species is subject to a random disorder potential and the other acts as a heat bath. We obtain a filling fraction dependent phase diagram with a critical filling consistent with experiments. We also calculate two-point correlation functions and the quantum mutual information between sites. We observe a distribution of the quantum mutual information in the many-body localized regime which is consistent with the presence of resonances, similar to those observed in one-dimensional many-body localized systems.</description>

      <title>Photonic Simulation of Localization Phenomena Using Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation in its current state faces experimental overhead in terms of physical space and cooling. We propose boson sampling as an alternative compact synthetic platform performing at room temperature. Identifying the capability of estimating matrix permanents, we explore the applicability of boson sampling for tackling the dynamics of quantum systems without having access to information about the full state vector. By mapping the time-evolution unitary of a Hamiltonian onto an interferometer via continuous-variable gate decompositions, we present proof-of-principle results of localization characteristics of a single particle. We study the dynamics of one-dimensional tight-binding systems in the clean and quasiperiodic-disordered limits to observe Bloch oscillations and dynamical localization, and the delocalization-to-localization phase transition in the Aubry- Andre-Harper model respectively. Our computational results obtained using boson sampling are in complete agreement with the dynamical and static results of non-interacting tight-binding systems obtained using conventional numerical calculations. Additionally, our study highlights the role of number of sampling measurements or shots for simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed state topological order in a stabilizer system under stochastic decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering quantum orders in mixed many-body systems is an ongoing issue. Very recently, the notion of an intrinsic mixed state topologically-ordered (IMTO) state was proposed. As a concrete example, we observe the emergence of IMTO by studying the toric code system under stochastic maximal decoherence by $ZX$-diagonal type projective measurement without monitoring. We study how the toric code state changes to an IMTO state at the level of the averaged quantum trajectories. This phase transition is understood from the viewpoint of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 1-form weak symmetry, that is, the IMTO is characterized by the symmetry restoration from the SSB, which comes from the proliferation of anyons. To understand the emergent IMTO, order and disorder parameters of 1-form symmetry are numerically studied by stabilizer simulation. The present study clarifies the existence of two kinds of fermionic anyons, and also the obtained critical exponents indicate strong relation between IMTO and percolation.</description>

      <title>Multistable Synaptic Plasticity induces Memory Effects and Cohabitation of Chimera and Bump States in Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chimera states and bump states are collective synchronization phenomena observed independently (at different parameter regions) in networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators. And while chimera states are characterized by coexistence of coherent and incoherent domains, bump states consist of active domains operating on a silent background. Multistable plasticity in the network connections originates from brain dynamics and is based on the idea that neural cells may transmit inhibitory or excitatory signals depending on various factors, such as local connectivity, influence of neighboring cells etc. During the system/network integration, the link weights adapt and, in the case of multistability, they may organize in coexisting excitatory and/or inhibitory domains. Here, we explore the influence of bistable plasticity on collective synchronization states and we numerically demonstrate that the dynamics of the linking may give rise to co-existence of bump-like and chimera-like states simultaneously in the network. In the case of bump and chimera co-existence, confinement effects are developed: the different domains stay localized and do not travel around the network. Memory effects are also reported in the sense that the final spatial arrangement of the coupling strengths reflects some of the local properties of the initial link distribution. For the quantification of the system's spatial and temporal features, the global and local entropy functions are employed as measures of the network organization, while the average firing rates account for the network evolution and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Quantum Hopfield Network: A numerical analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present extensive simulations of a quantum version of the Hopfield Neural Network to explore its emergent behavior. The system is a network of $N$ qubits oscillating at a given $\Omega$ frequency and which are coupled via Lindblad jump operators built with local fields $h_i$ depending on some given stored patterns. Our simulations show the emergence of pattern-antipattern oscillations of the overlaps with the stored patterns similar (for large $\Omega$ and small temperature) to those reported within a recent mean-field description of such a system, and which are originated deterministically by the quantum term including $s_x^i$ qubit operators. However, in simulations we observe that such oscillations are stochastic due to the interplay between noise and the inherent metastability of the pattern attractors induced by quantum oscillations, and then are damped in finite systems when one averages over many quantum trajectories. In addition, we report the system behavior for large number of stored patterns at the lowest temperature we can reach in simulations (namely $T=0.005\, T_C$). Our study reveals that for small-size systems the quantum term of the Hamiltonian has a negative effect on storage capacity, decreasing the overlap with the starting memory pattern for increased values of $\Omega$ and number of stored patterns. However, it also impedes the system to be trapped for long time in mixtures and spin-glass states. Interestingly, the system also presents a range of $\Omega$ values for which, although the initial pattern is destabilized due to quantum oscillations, other patterns can be retrieved and remain stable even for many stored patterns, implying a quantum-dependent nonlinear relationship between the recall process and the number of stored patterns.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Kernel Density Estimators in Large Dimensions</title>

Abstract: This paper studies Kernel Density Estimation for a high-dimensional distribution $\rho(x)$. Traditional approaches have focused on the limit of large number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead the regime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality $d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\alpha=(\log n)/d$. Our study reveals three distinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)=\frac{1}{n h^d}\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{x-y_i}{h}\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classical regime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, which is akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value of the bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. The statistics of $\hat\rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from $\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stable distribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\alpha)$, we find that $\hat\rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only a few points in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to the density estimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold based on Kullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified in this paper. As known by practitioners, when decreasing the bandwidth a Kernel-estimated estimated changes from a smooth curve to a collections of peaks centred on the data points. Our findings reveal that this general phenomenon is related to sharp transitions between phases characterized by different statistical properties, and offer new insights for Kernel density estimation in high-dimensional settings.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spiking artificial neuron design based on a combined spin valve/magnetic tunnel junction (SV/MTJ). Traditional hardware used in artificial intelligence and machine learning faces significant challenges related to high power consumption and scalability. To address these challenges, spintronic neurons, which can mimic biologically inspired neural behaviors, offer a promising solution. We present a model of an SV/MTJ-based neuron which uses technologies that have been successfully integrated with CMOS in commercially available applications. The operational dynamics of the neuron are derived analytically through the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation, demonstrating its ability to replicate key spiking characteristics of biological neurons, such as response latency and refractive behavior. Simulation results indicate that the proposed neuron design can operate on a timescale of about 1 ns, without any bias current, and with power consumption as low as 50 uW.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>
