      <title>Orthogonal factorial designs for trials of therapist-delivered interventions: Randomising intervention-therapist combinations to patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is recognised that treatment-related clustering should be allowed for in the sample size and analyses of individually-randomised parallel-group trials that evaluate therapist-delivered interventions such as psychotherapy. Here, interventions are a treatment factor, but therapists are not. If the aim of a trial is to separate effects of therapists from those of interventions, we propose that interventions and therapists should be regarded as two potentially interacting treatment factors (one fixed, one random) with a factorial structure. We consider the specific design where each therapist delivers each intervention (crossed therapist-intervention design), and the resulting therapist-intervention combinations are randomised to patients. We adopt a classical Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to propose a family of orthogonal factorial designs and their associated data analyses, which allow for therapist learning and centre too. We set out the associated data analyses using ANOVA and regression and report the results of a small simulation study conducted to explore the performance of the proposed randomisation methods in estimating the intervention effect and its standard error, the between-therapist variance and the between-therapist variance in the intervention effect. We conclude that more purposeful trial design has the potential to lead to better evidence on a range of complex interventions and outline areas for further methodological research.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Partial Least Squares Regression with Multiple Functional and Scalar Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by renal imaging studies that combine renogram curves with pharmacokinetic and demographic covariates, we propose Hybrid partial least squares (Hybrid PLS) for simultaneous supervised dimension reduction and regression in the presence of cross-modality correlations. The proposed approach embeds multiple functional and scalar predictors into a unified hybrid Hilbert space and rigorously extends the nonlinear iterative PLS (NIPALS) algorithm. This theoretical development is complemented by a sample-level algorithm that incorporates roughness penalties to control smoothness. By exploiting the rank-one structure of the resulting optimization problem, the algorithm admits a computationally efficient closed-form solution that requires solving only linear systems at each iteration. We establish fundamental geometric properties of the proposed framework, including orthogonality of the latent scores and PLS directions. Extensive numerical studies on synthetic data, together with an application to a renal imaging study, validate these theoretical results and demonstrate the method's ability to recover predictive structure under intermodal multicollinearity, yielding parsimonious low-dimensional representations.</description>

      <title>Inference for competing risks based on area between curves statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In competing risks models, cumulative incidence functions are commonly compared to infer differences between groups. Many existing inference methods, however, struggle when these functions cross during the time frame of interest. To address this problem, we investigate a test statistic based on the area between cumulative incidence functions. As the corresponding limiting distribution depends on quantities that are typically unknown, we propose a wild bootstrap approach to obtain a feasible and asymptotically valid two-sample test. The finite sample performance of the proposed method, in comparison with existing methods, is examined in an extensive simulation study.</description>

      <title>Spherical Spatial Autoregressive Model for Spherically Embedded Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherically embedded spatial data are spatially indexed observations whose values naturally reside on or can be equivalently mapped to the unit sphere. Such data are increasingly ubiquitous in fields ranging from geochemistry to demography. However, analysing such data presents unique difficulties due to the intrinsic non-Euclidean nature of the sphere, and rigorous methodologies for statistical modelling, inference, and uncertainty quantification remain limited. This paper introduces a unified framework to address these three limitations for spherically embedded spatial data. We first propose a novel spherical spatial autoregressive model that leverages optimal transport geometry and then extend it to accommodate exogenous covariates. Second, for either scenario with or without covariates, we establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators and derive a distribution-free Wald test for spatial dependence, complemented by a bootstrap procedure to enhance finite-sample performance. Third, we contribute a novel approach to uncertainty quantification by developing a conformal prediction procedure specifically tailored to spherically embedded spatial data. The practical utility of these methodological advances is illustrated through extensive simulations and applications to Spanish geochemical compositions and Japanese age-at-death mortality distributions.</description>

      <title>Sequential Experimental Designs for Kriging Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer experiments have become an indispensable alternative to complex physical and engineering experiments. The Kriging model is the most widely used surrogate model, with the core goal of minimizing the discrepancy between the surrogate and true models across the entire experimental domain. However, existing sequential design methods have critical limitations: observation-based batch sequential designs are rarely studied, while one-point sequential designs have insufficient information utilization and suffer from inefficient resource utilization -- they require numerous repeated observation rounds to accumulate sufficient points, leading to prolonged experimental cycles. To address these gaps, this paper proposes two novel one-point sequential design criteria and a general batch sequential design framework. Moreover, the batch sequential design framework solves the inherent point clustering problem in naive batch selection, enabling efficient extension of any sequential criterion to batch scenarios. Simulations on some test functions demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches in terms of fitting accuracy in most cases.</description>

      <title>Variational Dimension Lifting for Robust Tracking of Nonlinear Stochastic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear stochastic motion presents significant challenges for Bayesian particle tracking. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a framework to construct an invertible transformation that maps the nonlinear state-space model (SSM) into a higher-dimensional linear Gaussian SSM. This approach allows the application of standard linear-Gaussian inference techniques while maintaining a connection to the dynamics of the original system. The paper derives the necessary conditions for such transformations using Ito's lemma and variational calculus, and illustrates the method on a bistable cubic motion model, radial Brownian process model, and a logistic model with multiplicative noise. Simulations confirm that the transformed linear systems, when projected back, accurately reconstruct the nonlinear dynamics and, in distinct regimes of stiffness and singularity, yield tracking accuracy competitive with conventional filters, while avoiding their structural instabilities.</description>

      <title>Variational approximate penalized credible regions for Bayesian grouped regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fast and accurate grouped penalized credible region approach for variable selection and prediction in Bayesian high-dimensional linear regression. Most existing Bayesian methods either are subject to high computational costs due to long Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs or yield ambiguous variable selection results due to non-sparse solution output. The penalized credible region framework yields sparse post-processed estimates that facilitates unambiguous grouped variable selection. High estimation accuracy is achieved by shrinking noise from unimportant groups using a grouped global-local shrinkage prior. To ensure computational scalability, we approximate posterior summaries using coordinate ascent variational inference and recast the penalized credible region framework as a convex optimization problem that admits efficient computations. We prove that the resultant post-processed estimators are both parameter-consistent and variable selection consistent in high-dimensional settings. Theory is developed to justify running the coordinate ascent algorithm for at least two cycles. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in grouped variable selection, prediction, and computation time for several common models including ANOVA and nonparametric varying coefficient models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametric Causal Inference for High-Dimensional Nutritional Data via Factor-Based Exposure Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diet plays a crucial role in health, and understanding the causal effects of dietary patterns is essential for informing public health policy and personalized nutrition strategies. However, causal inference in nutritional epidemiology faces several challenges: (i) high-dimensional and correlated food/nutrient intake data induce massive treatment levels; (ii) nutritional studies are interested in latent dietary patterns rather than single food items; and (iii) the goal is to estimate heterogeneous causal effects of these dietary patterns on health outcomes. We address these challenges by introducing a sophisticated exposure mapping framework that reduces the high-dimensional treatment space via factor analysis and enables the identification of dietary patterns. We also extend the Bayesian Causal Forest to accommodate three ordered levels of dietary exposure, better capturing the complex structure of nutritional data and enabling estimation of heterogeneous causal effects. We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulations and apply it to a multi-center epidemiological study of Hispanic/Latino adults residing in the US. Using high-dimensional dietary data, we identify six dietary patterns and estimate their causal link with two key health risk factors: body mass index and fasting insulin levels. Our findings suggest that higher consumption of plant lipid-antioxidant, plant-based, animal protein, and dairy product patterns is associated with reduced risk.</description>

      <title>Conformal prediction for full and sparse polynomial chaos expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCEs) are widely recognized for their efficient computational performance in surrogate modeling. Yet, a robust framework to quantify local model errors is still lacking. While the local uncertainty of PCE prediction can be captured using bootstrap resampling, other methods offering more rigorous statistical guarantees are needed, especially in the context of small training datasets. Recently, conformal predictions have demonstrated strong potential in machine learning, providing statistically robust and model-agnostic prediction intervals. Due to its generality and versatility, conformal prediction is especially valuable, as it can be adapted to suit a variety of problems, making it a compelling choice for PCE-based surrogate models. In this contribution, we explore its application to PCE-based surrogate models. More precisely, we present the integration of two conformal prediction methods, namely the full conformal and the Jackknife+ approaches, into both full and sparse PCEs. For full PCEs, we introduce computational shortcuts inspired by the inherent structure of regression methods to optimize the implementation of both conformal methods. For sparse PCEs, we incorporate the two approaches with appropriate modifications to the inference strategy, thereby circumventing the non-symmetrical nature of the regression algorithm and ensuring valid prediction intervals. Our developments yield better-calibrated prediction intervals for both full and sparse PCEs, achieving superior coverage over existing approaches, such as the bootstrap, while maintaining a moderate computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of robust statistics is the development of methods able to cope with the presence of outliers. A new type of outliers, namely "cellwise", has garnered considerable attention. The state of the art for dealing with cellwise contamination in different models is presented in Raymaekers and Rousseeuw (2024). Outliers in time series can be treated as cellwise outliers, a further discussion on this subject is presented.</description>

      <title>Finite Population Inference for Factorial Designs and Panel Experiments with Imperfect Compliance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a finite population framework for analyzing causal effects in settings with imperfect compliance where multiple treatments affect the outcome of interest. Two prominent examples are factorial designs and panel experiments with imperfect compliance. I define finite population causal effects that capture the relative effectiveness of alternative treatment sequences. I provide nonparametric estimators for a rich class of factorial and dynamic causal effects and derive their finite population distributions as the sample size increases. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the desirable properties of the estimators. Finally, I use the estimator for causal effects in factorial designs to revisit a famous voter mobilization experiment that analyzes the effects of voting encouragement through phone calls on turnout.</description>

      <title>From Noisy News Sentiment Scores to Interpretable Temporal Dynamics: A Bayesian State-Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-based sentiment indicators are widely used to monitor public and market mood, but weekly sentiment series are noisy by construction. A main reason is that the amount of relevant news changes over time and across categories. As a result, some weekly averages are based on many articles, while others rely on only a few. Existing approaches do not explicitly account for changes in data availability when measuring uncertainty. We present a Bayesian state-space framework that turns aggregated news sentiment into a smoothed time series with uncertainty. The model treats each weekly sentiment value as a noisy measurement of an underlying sentiment process, with observation uncertainty scaled by the effective information weight $n_{tj}$: when coverage is high, latent sentiment is anchored more strongly to the observed aggregate; when coverage is low, inference relies more on the latent dynamics and uncertainty increases. Using news data grouped into multiple categories, we find broadly similar latent dynamics across categories, while larger differences appear in observation noise. The framework is designed for descriptive monitoring and can be extended to other text sources where information availability varies over time.</description>

      <title>Spectral embedding of inhomogeneous Poisson processes on multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world networks, data on the edges evolve in continuous time, naturally motivating representations based on point processes. Heterogeneity in edge types further gives rise to multiplex network point processes. In this work, we propose a model for multiplex network data observed in continuous-time. We establish two-to-infinity norm consistency and asymptotic normality for spectral-embedding-based estimation of the model parameters as both network size and time resolution increase. Drawing inspiration from random dot product graph models, each edge intensity is expressed as the inner product of two low-dimensional latent positions: one dynamic and layer-agnostic, the other static and layer-dependent. These latent positions constitute the primary objects of inference, which is conducted via spectral embedding methods. Our theoretical results are established under a histogram estimator of the network intensities and provide justification for applying a doubly unfolded adjacency spectral embedding method for estimation. Simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and inference procedure.</description>

      <title>Directional-Shift Dirichlet ARMA Models for Compositional Time Series with Structural Break Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositional time series, vectors of proportions summing to unity observed over time, frequently exhibit structural breaks due to external shocks, policy changes, or market disruptions. Standard methods either ignore such breaks or handle them through ad-hoc dummy variables that cannot extrapolate beyond the estimation sample. We develop a Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA model augmented with a directional-shift intervention mechanism that captures structural breaks through three interpretable parameters: a unit direction vector specifying which components gain or lose share, an amplitude controlling the magnitude of redistribution, and a logistic gate governing the timing and speed of transition. The model preserves compositional constraints by construction, maintains innovation-form DARMA dynamics for short-run dependence, and produces coherent probabilistic forecasts during and after structural breaks. We establish that the directional shift corresponds to geodesic motion on the simplex and is invariant to the choice of ILR basis. A comprehensive simulation study with 400 fits across 8 scenarios demonstrates that when the shift direction is correctly identified (77.5% of cases), amplitude and timing parameters are recovered with near-zero bias, and credible intervals for the mean composition achieve nominal 80% coverage; we address the sign identification challenge through a hemisphere constraint. An empirical application to fee recognition lead-time distributions during COVID-19 compares baseline, fixed-effects, and intervention specifications in rolling forecast evaluation, demonstrating the intervention model's superior point accuracy (Aitchison distance 0.83 vs. 0.90) and calibration (87% vs. 71% coverage) during structural transitions.</description>

      <title>Directional Asymmetry in Edge BasedSpatial Models via a Skew Normal Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a skewed edge based spatial prior, named RENeGe sk that extends the Gaussian RENeGe framework by incorporating directional asymmetry through a skew normal distribution. Skewness is defined on the edge graph and propagated to the node space, aligning asymmetric behavior with transitions across neighboring regions rather than with marginal node effects. The model is formulated within the skew normal framework and employs identifiable hierarchical priors together with low rank parameterizations to ensure scalability. The skew normal's stochastic representation is considered to facilitate the computational implementation. Simulation studies show that RENeGe sk recovers compact, edge-aligned directional structure more accurately than symmetric Gaussian priors, while remaining competitive under irregular spatial patterns. An application to cancer incidence data in Southern Brazil illustrates how the proposed approach yields stable area-level estimates while preserving localized, directionally driven spatial variation.</description>

      <title>Perfect Clustering for Sparse Directed Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact recovery in stochastic block models (SBMs) is well understood in undirected settings, but remains considerably less developed for directed and sparse networks, particularly when the number of communities diverges. Spectral methods for directed SBMs often lack stability in asymmetric, low-degree regimes, and existing non-spectral approaches focus primarily on undirected or dense settings.
  We propose a fully non-spectral, two-stage procedure for community detection in sparse directed SBMs with potentially growing numbers of communities. The method first estimates the directed probability matrix using a neighborhood-smoothing scheme tailored to the asymmetric setting, and then applies $K$-means clustering to the estimated rows, thereby avoiding the limitations of eigen- or singular value decompositions in sparse, asymmetric networks. Our main theoretical contribution is a uniform row-wise concentration bound for the smoothed estimator, obtained through new arguments that control asymmetric neighborhoods and separate in- and out-degree effects. These results imply the exact recovery of all community labels with probability tending to one, under mild sparsity and separation conditions that allow both $\gamma_n \to 0$ and $K_n \to \infty$.
  Simulation studies, including highly directed, sparse, and non-symmetric block structures, demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs reliably in regimes where directed spectral and score-based methods deteriorate. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first exact recovery guarantee for this class of non-spectral, neighborhood-smoothing methods in the sparse, directed setting.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic testing of covariance separability for matrix elliptical data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic test for the separability of a covariance matrix. The null distribution is valid in wide matrix elliptical model that includes, in particular, both matrix Gaussian and matrix $t$-distribution. The test is fast to compute and makes no assumptions about the component covariance matrices. An alternative, Wald-type version of the test is also proposed. Our simulations reveal that both versions of the test have good power even for heavier-tailed distributions and can compete with the Gaussian likelihood ratio test in the case of normal data.</description>

      <title>Nested Instrumental Variables Analysis: Switcher Average Treatment Effect, Identification, Efficient Estimation and Generalizability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07102v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used to estimate causal effects from non-randomized data. A canonical example is a randomized trial with noncompliance, in which the randomized treatment assignment serves as an IV for the non-ignorable treatment received. Under a monotonicity assumption, a valid IV nonparametrically identifies the average treatment effect among a latent complier subgroup, whose generalizability is often under debate. In many studies, there exist multiple versions of an IV, for instance, different nudges to take the same treatment in different study sites in a multicenter clinical trial. These different versions of an IV may result in different compliance rates and offer a unique opportunity to study IV estimates' generalizability. In this article, we introduce a novel nested IV assumption and study identification of the average treatment effect among two latent subgroups: always-compliers and switchers, who are defined based on the joint potential treatment received under two versions of a binary IV. We derive the efficient influence function for the SWitcher Average Treatment Effect (SWATE) under a nonparametric model and propose efficient estimators. We then propose formal statistical tests of the generalizability of IV estimates under the nested IV framework. The proposed tests are flexible nonparametric generalizations of classical overidentification tests that allow estimating nuisance parameters using machine learning tools. We apply the proposed method to the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and study the causal effect of colorectal cancer screening and its generalizability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article focuses on covariance estimation for multi-study data. Popular approaches employ factor-analytic terms with shared and study-specific loadings that decompose the variance into (i) a shared low-rank component, (ii) study-specific low-rank components, and (iii) a diagonal term capturing idiosyncratic variability. Our proposed methodology estimates the latent factors via spectral decompositions, with a novel approach for separating shared and specific factors, and infers the factor loadings and residual variances via surrogate Bayesian regressions. The resulting posterior has a simple product form across outcomes, bypassing the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and facilitating parallelization. The proposed methodology has major advantages over current Bayesian competitors in terms of computational speed, scalability and stability while also having strong frequentist guarantees. The theory and methods also add to the rich literature on frequentist methods for factor models with shared and group-specific components of variation. The approximation error decreases as the sample size and the data dimension diverge, formalizing a blessing of dimensionality. We show favorable asymptotic properties, including central limit theorems for point estimators and posterior contraction, and excellent empirical performance in simulations. The methods are applied to integrate three studies on gene associations among immune cells.</description>

      <title>Clustered random forests with correlated data for optimal estimation and inference under potential covariate shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop Clustered Random Forests, a random forests algorithm for clustered data, arising from independent groups that exhibit within-cluster dependence. The leaf-wise predictions for each decision tree making up clustered random forests takes the form of a weighted least squares estimator, which leverage correlations between observations for improved prediction accuracy and tighter confidence intervals when performing inference. We show that approximately linear time algorithms exist for fitting classes of clustered random forests, matching the computational complexity of standard random forests. Further, we observe that the optimality of a clustered random forest, with regards to how optimal weights are chosen within this framework i.e. those that minimise mean squared prediction error, vary under covariate distribution shift. In light of this, we advocate weight estimation to be determined by a user-chosen covariate distribution, or test dataset of covariates, with respect to which optimal prediction or inference is desired. This highlights a key distinction between correlated and independent data with regards to optimality of nonparametric conditional mean estimation under covariate shift. We demonstrate our theoretical findings numerically in a number of simulated and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Conditional Group Distributionally Robust Optimization with Cross-Entropy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-source learning with discrete labels, distributional heterogeneity across domains poses a central challenge to developing predictive models that transfer reliably to unseen domains. We study multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation, where labeled data are available from multiple source domains and only unlabeled data are observed from the target domain. To address potential distribution shifts, we propose a novel Conditional Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (CG-DRO) framework that learns a classifier by minimizing the worst-case cross-entropy loss over the convex combinations of the conditional outcome distributions from sources domains. We develop an efficient Mirror Prox algorithm for solving the minimax problem and employ a double machine learning procedure to estimate the risk function, ensuring that errors in nuisance estimation contribute only at higher-order rates. We establish fast statistical convergence rates for the empirical CG-DRO estimator by constructing two surrogate minimax optimization problems that serve as theoretical bridges. A distinguishing challenge for CG-DRO is the emergence of nonstandard asymptotics: the empirical CG-DRO estimator may fail to converge to a standard limiting distribution due to boundary effects and system instability. To address this, we introduce a perturbation-based inference procedure that enables uniformly valid inference, including confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>On the permutation equivariance principle for causal estimands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many causal inference problems, multiple action variables, such as factors, mediators, or network units, often share a common causal role yet lack a natural ordering. To avoid ambiguity, the scientific interpretation of a vector of estimands should remain invariant under relabeling, an implicit principle we refer to as permutation equivariance. Permutation equivariance can be understood as the property that permuting the variables permutes the estimands in a trackable manner, such that scientific meaning is preserved. We formally characterize this principle and study its combinatorial algebra. We present a class of weighted estimands that project unstructured potential outcome means into a vector of permutation equivariant and interpretable estimands capturing all orders of interaction. To guide practice, we discuss the implications and choices of weights and define residual-free estimands, whose inclusion-exclusion sums capture the maximal effect, which is useful in context such as causal mediation and network interference. We present the application of our general theory to three canonical examples and extend our results to ratio effect measures.</description>

      <title>Measuring deviations from spherical symmetry</title>

Abstract: Most of the work on checking spherical symmetry assumptions on the distribution of the $p$-dimensional random vector $Y$ has its focus on statistical tests for the null hypothesis of exact spherical symmetry. In this paper, we take a different point of view and propose a measure for the deviation from spherical symmetry, which is based on the minimum distance between the distribution of the vector $\big (\|Y\|, Y/ \|Y\| )^\top $ and its best approximation by a distribution of a vector $\big (\|Y_s\|, Y_s/ \|Y_s \| )^\top $ corresponding to a random vector $Y_s$ with a spherical distribution. We develop estimators for the minimum distance with corresponding statistical guarantees (provided by asymptotic theory) and demonstrate the applicability of our approach by means of a simulation study and a real data example.</description>

      <title>A Multilayer Probit Network Model for Community Detection with Dependent Edges and Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection in multilayer networks, which aims to identify groups of nodes exhibiting similar connectivity patterns across multiple network layers, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Most existing methods are based on the assumption that different layers are either independent or follow specific dependence structures, and edges within the same layer are independent. In this article, we propose a novel method for community detection in multilayer networks that accounts for a broad range of inter-layer and intra-layer dependence structures. The proposed method integrates the multilayer stochastic block model for community detection with a multivariate probit model to capture the structures of inter-layer dependence, which also allows intra-layer dependence. To facilitate parameter estimation, we develop a constrained pairwise likelihood method coupled with an efficient alternating updating algorithm. The asymptotic properties of the proposed method are also established, with a focus on examining the influence of inter-layer and intra-layer dependences on the accuracy of both parameter estimation and community detection. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments on both simulated networks and a real-world multilayer trade network.</description>

      <title>On Nonasymptotic Confidence Intervals for Treatment Effects in Randomized Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonasymptotic (finite-sample) confidence intervals for treatment effects in randomized experiments. In the existing literature, the effective sample sizes of nonasymptotic confidence intervals tend to be looser than the corresponding central-limit-theorem-based confidence intervals by a factor depending on the square root of the propensity score. We show that this performance gap can be closed, designing nonasymptotic confidence intervals that have the same effective sample size as their asymptotic counterparts. Our approach involves systematic exploitation of negative dependence or variance adaptivity (or both). We also show that the nonasymptotic rates that we achieve are unimprovable in an information-theoretic sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multivariate regression discontinuity design in which treatment is assigned by crossing a boundary in the space of multiple running variables. We document that the existing bandwidth selector is suboptimal for a multivariate regression discontinuity design when the distance to a boundary point is used for its running variable, and introduce a multivariate local-linear estimator for multivariate regression discontinuity designs. Our estimator is asymptotically valid and can capture heterogeneous treatment effects over the boundary. We demonstrate that our estimator exhibits smaller root mean squared errors and often shorter confidence intervals in numerical simulations. We illustrate our estimator in our empirical applications of multivariate designs of a Colombian scholarship study and a U.S. House of representative voting study and demonstrate that our estimator reveals richer heterogeneous treatment effects with often shorter confidence intervals than the existing estimator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is increasingly common to collect data of multiple different types on the same set of samples. Our focus is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary factor regression models. A baseline Joint Factor Regression (\textsc{jfr}) captures combined variation across views via a single factor set, and a more nuanced Joint Additive FActor Regression (\textsc{jafar}) that decomposes variation into shared and view-specific components. For \textsc{jfr}, we use independent cumulative shrinkage process (\textsc{i-cusp}) priors, while for \textsc{jafar} we develop a dependent version (\textsc{d-cusp}) designed to ensure identifiability of the components. We develop Gibbs samplers that exploit the model structure and accommodate flexible feature and outcome distributions. Prediction of time-to-labor onset from immunome, metabolome, and proteome data illustrates performance gains against state-of-the-art competitors. Our open-source software (\texttt{R} package) is available at https://github.com/niccoloanceschi/jafar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of Bayesian ensembles and address the challenge of learning optimal combinations of Bayesian models in an online, continual learning setting. To this end, we reinterpret existing approaches such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and Bayesian stacking through a novel empirical Bayes lens, shedding new light on the limitations and pathologies of BMA. Further motivated by insights from online optimization, we propose Online Bayesian Stacking (OBS), a method that optimizes the log-score over predictive distributions to adaptively combine Bayesian models. A key contribution of our work is establishing a novel connection between OBS and portfolio selection, bridging Bayesian ensemble learning with a rich, well-studied theoretical framework that offers efficient algorithms and extensive regret analysis. We further clarify the relationship between OBS and online BMA, showing that they optimize related but distinct cost functions. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we identify scenarios where OBS outperforms online BMA and provide principled methods and guidance on when practitioners should prefer one approach over the other.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Cyclic Causal Discovery Under Unmeasured Confounders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Nonparametric Tests For Shape Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a kernel-based nonparametric framework for mean-variance optimization that enables inference on economically motivated shape constraints in finance, including positivity, monotonicity, and convexity. Many central hypotheses in financial econometrics are naturally expressed as shape relations on latent functions (e.g., term premia, CAPM relations, and the pricing kernel), yet enforcing such constraints during estimation can mask economically meaningful violations; our approach therefore separates learning from validation by first estimating an unconstrained solution and then testing shape properties. We establish statistical properties of the regularized sample estimator and derive rigorous guarantees, including asymptotic consistency, a functional central limit theorem, and a finite-sample deviation bound achieving the Monte Carlo rate up to a regularization term. Building on these results, we construct a joint Wald-type statistic to test shape constraints on finite grids. An efficient algorithm based on a pivoted Cholesky factorization yields scalability to large datasets. Numerical studies, including an options-based asset-pricing application, illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method for evaluating monotonicity and convexity restrictions.</description>
