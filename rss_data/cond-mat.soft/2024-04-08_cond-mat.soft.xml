      <title>Contact-based molecular dynamics of structured and disordered proteins in a coarse-grained model: fixed contacts, switchable contacts and those described by pseudo-improper-dihedral angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coarse-grained C$\alpha$-based protein model that can be used to simulate structured, intrinsically disordered and partially disordered proteins. We use a Go-like potential for the structured parts and two different variants of a transferable potential for the disordered parts. The first variant uses dynamic structure-based (DSB) contacts that form and disappear quasi-adiabatically during the simulation. By using specific structural criteria we distinguish sidechain-sidechain, sidechain-backbone and backbone-backbone contacts. The second variant is a non-radial multi-body pseudo-improper-dihedral (PID) potential that does not include time-dependent terms but requires more computational resources. Our model can simulate in reasonable time thousands of residues on millisecond time scales.</description>

      <title>Phases, morphologies, and transitions in a membrane model for the endoplasmic reticulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel model, comprising self-avoiding surfaces and incorporating edges and tubules, that is designed to characterize the structural morphologies and transitions observed within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). By employing discretized models, we model smooth membranes with triangulated surfaces, and we utilize numerical variational methods to minimize energies associated with periodic morphologies. Our study obtains phases, their morphologies, and their transitions and examines their dependence on the membrane chemical potential, the line tensions, and the positive Gaussian curvature stiffness. By starting with diverse topological structures, we explore shape variations by using Surface Evolver, while maintaining fixed topology. Notably, we identify the region of parameter space where the model displays lamellae, with a lattice of helical edges connecting the layers; this resembles structures that have been observed in the rough ER. Furthermore, our investigation reveals an intricate phase diagram with periodic structures, including flat lamellar sheets, sponge phases, and configurations comprising tubules with junctions, which are akin to the morphology of the smooth ER. An estimation of lattice parameters is achieved through fluctuation analysis. Significantly, our model predicts a transition between homotopically equivalent lamellae, with helical edges and configurations featuring tubules with junctions.</description>

      <title>Pressure-dependent adhesion between solid-supported PC-lipid bilayers and vesicles under electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion of lipid bilayers in membranes is important in processes from vesicle-cell interactions (as in drug delivery) to exosome-cell signaling, while transient transmembrane electric fields are known to occur spontaneously. Two contacting phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid membranes are known to fuse into one under external electric fields, suggesting that the interaction between them is modified by the field as they approach, prior to the fusion event. Here we measure directly the adhesion energy between dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and between distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) surface layers attached to solid substrates both without and with a transmembrane electric field. We find a marked pressure-dependent adhesion behavior in the electric field, which we attribute to fusion intermediates that are formed, shedding new light on membrane electro-fusion.</description>

      <title>Detailed balance in non-equilibrium dynamics of granular matter: derivation and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering fundamental principles governing the dynamics of granular media has been a long-standing challenge. Recent predictions of detailed balance steady states (DBSS), supported by experimental observations in cyclic shear experiments of planar granular systems, called into question the common belief that the detailed balance principle is only a feature of equilibrium. Here, we first show analytically that DBSS in planar granular dynamics arise when a certain conditional cell order distribution is independent of the condition. We then demonstrate that this condition is met in rotational shear experiments, which indeed also give rise to robust DBSS. This suggests that DBSS not only exist but are also quite common. We also show that, when the unconditional cell order distribution maximises the entropy, as has been found recently, then this distribution is determined by a single parameter - the ratio of splitting and merging rates of cells of any arbitrary order. These results simplify the modelling of the complex dynamics of planar granular systems to the solution of recently proposed evolution equations, demonstrating their predictive power.</description>

      <title>Bioinspired polymer-incorporating self-lubricating and antifouling hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthy articular cartilage has excellent lubricating properties, with friction coefficients reaching extremely low values at physiological pressures. Such high-performing lubricating layer in joints is attributed to the surface hydration arising from the interplay between multiple hydrophilic biopolymers (such as hyaluronic acid, proteoglycans, and lubricin) and phospholipids in the cartilage matrix. Mimicking such molecular structure, hydrogels, composed of a hydrophilic polymer network, have the potential to replicate the lubricating feature and possibly replace natural cartilages. In this study, we have synthesized a poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) (PMPC-co-PNIPAM, PMN)random copolymer with highly-hydrated lubricious 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine moieties and less hydrated N-isopropylacrylamide moieties. Incorporation of PMN copolymers within various hydrogels significantly reduces the gels sliding surface friction, resulting in low friction coefficients against different counter surfaces, including stainless steel (hard metal surface), polyethylene (hydrophobic surface), and polyHEMA (soft hydrogel surface). Additionally, hydrogels containing PMN are shown to be biocompatible and have excellent antifouling properties, making them an ideal coating for commercially available stents. With these qualities, hydrogels containing PMN stand out as a promising new material with numerous possible applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent polar order in non-polar mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phenomenological rules that govern the collective behaviour of complex physical systems are powerful tools because they can make concrete predictions about their universality class based on generic considerations, such as symmetries, conservation laws, and dimensionality. While in most cases such considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent symmetries dominate the behaviour of the system. We study a generic class of active matter systems with non-reciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner-Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory -- which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms -- belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar non-reciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</description>

      <title>Selecting active matter according to motility in an acoustofluidic setup: Self-propelled particles and sperm cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active systems -- including sperm cells, living organisms like bacteria, fish, birds, or active soft matter systems like synthetic ''microswimmers'' -- are characterized by motility, i.e., the ability to propel using their own ''engine''. Motility is the key feature that distinguishes active systems from passive or externally driven systems. In a large ensemble, motility of individual species can vary in a wide range. Selecting active species according to their motility represents an exciting and challenging problem. We propose a new method for selecting active species based on their motility using an acoustofluidic setup where highly motile species escape from the acoustic trap. This is demonstrated in simulations and in experiments with self-propelled Janus particles and human sperm. The immediate application of this method is selecting highly motile sperm for medically assisted reproduction (MAR). Due to the tunable acoustic trap, the proposed method is more flexible than the existing passive microfluidic methods. The proposed selection method based on motility can also be applied to other active systems that require selecting highly motile species or removing immotile species.</description>

      <title>Wetting on Silicone Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicone is frequently used as a model system to investigate and tune wetting on soft materials. Silicone is biocompatible and shows excellent thermal, chemical, and UV stability. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the surface can be easily varied by several orders of magnitude in a controlled manner. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a popular choice for coating applications such as lubrication, self-cleaning, and drag reduction, facilitated by low surface energy. Aiming to understand the underlying interactions and forces, motivated numerous and detailed investigations of the static and dynamic wetting behavior of drops on PDMS-based surfaces. Here, we recognize the three most prevalent PDMS surface variants, namely liquid-infused (SLIPS/LIS), elastomeric, and liquid-like (SOCAL) surfaces. To understand, optimize, and tune the wetting properties of these PDMS surfaces, we review and compare their similarities and differences by discussing (i) the chemical and molecular structure, and (ii) the static and dynamic wetting behavior. We also provide (iii) an overview of methods and techniques to characterize PDMS-based surfaces and their wetting behavior. The static and dynamic wetting ridge is given particular attention, as it dominates energy dissipation, adhesion, and friction of sliding drops and influences the durability of the surfaces. We also discuss special features such as cloaking and wetting-induced phase separation. Key challenges and opportunities of these three surface variants are outlined.</description>

      <title>Confinement controls the creep rate in soft granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow in soft materials encompasses a wide range of viscous, plastic and elastic phenomena which provide challenges to modelling at the microscopic level. To create a controlled flow, we perform falling ball viscometry tests on packings of soft, frictionless hydrogel spheres. Systematic creep flow is found when a controlled driving stress is applied to a sinking sphere embedded in a packing. Here, we take the novel approach of applying an additional global confinement stress to the packing using an external load. This has enabled us to identify two distinct creep regimes. When confinement stress is small, the creep rate is independent of the load imposed. For larger confinement stresses, we find that the creep rate is set by the mechanical load acting on the packing. In the latter regime, the creep rate depends exponentially on the imposed stress. We can combine the two regimes via a rescaling onto a master curve, capturing the creep rate over five orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that bulk creep phenomena in these soft materials can be subtly controlled using an external mechanical force.</description>

Abstract: In the recent work "Non-reciprocal topological solitons in active metamaterials" (see arXiv:2312.03544v1), for an analytical understanding of the system under consideration, the authors derive an ordinary differential equation for the sine-Gordon (anti)soliton velocity, with the perturbation theory in the adiabatic approximation, via the inverse scattering transform formalism, see Eq. (3) in their work. Here we note that the latter equation for the (anti)soliton velocity also follows from an energy balance approach.</description>

      <title>Does nematic order allow groups of elongated cells to sense electric fields better?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective response to external directional cues like electric fields plays a pivotal role in processes such as tissue development, regeneration, and wound healing. In this study we focus on the impact of anisotropy in cell shape and local cell alignment on the collective response to electric fields. We model elongated cells that have a different accuracy sensing the field depending on their orientation with respect to the field. Elongated cells often line up with their long axes in the same direction - "nematic order" - does this help the group of cells sense the field more accurately? We use simulations of a simple model to show that if cells orient themselves perpendicular to their average velocity, alignment of a cell's long axis to its nearest neighbors' orientation can enhance the directional response to electric fields. However, for cells to benefit from aligning, their accuracy of sensing must be strongly dependent on cell orientation. We also show that cell-cell adhesion modulates the accuracy of cells in the group.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystal bulk and surface energies from density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Are quasicrystals stable or metastable? Density functional theory (DFT) is often used to evaluate thermodynamic stability, but quasicrystals are long-range aperiodic and their energies cannot be calculated using conventional ab initio methods. Here, we perform first-principles calculations on quasicrystal nanoparticles of increasing sizes, from which we can directly extrapolate their bulk and surface energies. Using this technique, we determine with high confidence that the icosahedral quasicrystals ScZn7.33 and YbCd5.7 are ground-state phases--revealing that translational symmetry is not a necessary condition for the T = 0 K stability of inorganic solids. Although we find the ScZn7.33 quasicrystal to be thermodynamically stable, we show on a mixed thermodynamic and kinetic phase diagram that its solidification from the melt is nucleation-limited, which illustrates why even stable materials may be kinetically challenging to grow. Our techniques here broadly open the door to first-principles investigations into the structure-bonding-stability relationships of aperiodic materials.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation by turbulent cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully developed turbulence is a universal and scale-invariant chaotic state characterized by an energy cascade from large to small scales where the cascade is eventually arrested by dissipation. In this article, we show how to harness these seemingly structureless turbulent cascades to generate patterns. Pattern formation entails a process of wavelength selection, which can usually be traced to the linear instability of a homogeneous state. By contrast, the mechanism we propose here is fully non-linear. It is triggered by a non-dissipative arrest of turbulent cascades: energy piles up at an intermediate scale, which is neither the system size nor the smallest scales at which energy is usually dissipated. Using a combination of theory and large-scale simulations, we show that the tunable wavelength of these cascade-induced patterns can be set by a non-dissipative transport coefficient called odd viscosity, ubiquitous in chiral fluids ranging from bio-active to quantum systems. Odd viscosity, which acts as a scale-dependent Coriolis-like force, leads to a two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales, in contrast with rotating fluids where a two-dimensionalization occurs at large scales. Beyond odd-viscosity fluids, we discuss how cascade-induced patterns can arise in natural systems including atmospheric flows, stellar plasma such as the solar wind~, or the pulverization and coagulation of objects or droplets where mass rather than energy cascades.</description>

      <title>Experimental testing of the Prandtl-Tomlinson model: Molecular origin of rotational friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural superlubricity, one of the most important concepts in modern tribology, has attracted lots of interest in both fundamental research and practical applications. However, the underlying model, known as the Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model, is oversimplified and not for real processes, despite its prevalence in frictional and structural lubricant studies. Here, with a realistic system, cholesteric liquid crystals, confined between two atomically smooth surfaces, we measure both the surface torque during rotational friction and the molecular rotation from the commensurate to incommensurate configuration at the onset of structural lubricity. Furthermore, by changing the surface potential or the strain, the Aubry transition is confirmed. The results agree well with the description by a quasi-one-dimensional version of the PT model and provide molecular evidence for rupture nucleation during static friction. Our study bridges the gap between theories and experiments and reinforces the connection between friction and fracture.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in complex mixtures with many components: analytical expressions for spinodal manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase behavior is investigated for systems composed of a large number of macromolecular components N, with N greater or equal to 2. Liquid-liquid phase separation is modelled using a virial expansion up to the second order of the concentrations of the components. Formal analytical expressions for the spinodal manifolds in N dimensions are derived that simplify their calculation (by transforming the original problem into inequalities that can be evaluated numerically using linear programming techniques). In addition, a new expression is obtained to calculate the critical manifold and the composition of the co-existing phases. The present analytical procedure complements previous attempts to handle spinodal decomposition for many components using a statistical approach based on Random Matrix Theory. The results are relevant for predicting effects of polydispersity on phase behavior in fields like polymer or food science, and to liquid-liquid phase separation in the cytosol of living cells.</description>

      <title>Bioinspired multi-asymmetric magnetized surfaces for tailoring energy-free liquid manipulation and 3-DOF solid transportation</title>

Abstract: Through the utilization of smart materials and well-designed structures, functional surfaces have been developed to enable small-scale liquid/solid manipulation tasks, thereby facilitating crucial applications in the fields of microfluidics, soft robotics, and biomedical engineering. However, the design of functional systems with flexible, tunable, and multimodal liquid/solid manipulation capabilities remains a challenging endeavor. Here, inspired by asymmetric structural features in natural plants and metachrony in cross-scale biological systems, I report a magnetic-responsive functional surface that can achieve rich liquid operations under static magnetic fields, while also enabling the transportation of solids with multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) under dynamic magnetic fields. The presence of curvature pillars on the surface, combined with their magnetic-driven tilt/gradient arrangement, imparts liquids with multi-directional spreading modes based on the asymmetry of Laplace pressure. I elucidate the mechanisms governing these liquid spreading modes and subsequently develop compelling liquid operations, such as adjustable anti-gravity climbing, spontaneous modal shifts in liquid transport, and liquid mixing. Furthermore, the dynamic metachronal motion of the magnetic pillars can be harnessed for solid object transportation. I illustrate the synchronous/asynchronous transport modes of the surface and propose a novel strategy for achieving 3-DOF solid transportation by coordinating the arrangement of objects and employing magnetic actuation strategies. This study presents a new design concept for application-oriented manipulation surfaces, which hold significant potential for extensive engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Without a Processor: Emergent Learning in a Nonlinear Electronic Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard deep learning algorithms require differentiating large nonlinear networks, a process that is slow and power-hungry. Electronic learning metamaterials offer potentially fast, efficient, and fault-tolerant hardware for analog machine learning, but existing implementations are linear, severely limiting their capabilities. These systems differ significantly from artificial neural networks as well as the brain, so the feasibility and utility of incorporating nonlinear elements have not been explored. Here we introduce a nonlinear learning metamaterial -- an analog electronic network made of self-adjusting nonlinear resistive elements based on transistors. We demonstrate that the system learns tasks unachievable in linear systems, including XOR and nonlinear regression, without a computer. We find our nonlinear learning metamaterial reduces modes of training error in order (mean, slope, curvature), similar to spectral bias in artificial neural networks. The circuitry is robust to damage, retrainable in seconds, and performs learned tasks in microseconds while dissipating only picojoules of energy across each transistor. This suggests enormous potential for fast, low-power computing in edge systems like sensors, robotic controllers, and medical devices, as well as manufacturability at scale for performing and studying emergent learning.</description>

      <title>Bendability parameter for twisted ribbons to describe longitudinal wrinkling and delineate the near-threshold regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dimensionless bendability parameter, $\epsilon^{-1} = [\left(h/W\right)^2 T^{-1}]^{-1}$ for wrinkling of thin, twisted ribbons with thickness $h$, width $W$, and tensional strain $T$. Bendability permits efficient collapse of data for wrinkle onset, wavelength, critical stress, and residual stress, demonstrating longitudinal wrinkling's primary dependence on this parameter. This new parameter also allows us to distinguish the highly bendable range ($\epsilon^{-1} &gt; 20$) from moderately bendable samples ($\epsilon^{-1} \in (0,20]$). We identify scaling relations to describe longitudinal wrinkles that are valid across our entire set of simulated ribbons. When restricted to the highly bendable regime, simulations confirm theoretical near-threshold (NT) predictions for wrinkle onset and wavelength.</description>

      <title>Chemotactic particles as strong electrolytes: Debye-H\"uckel approximation and effective mobility law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a binary mixture of chemically active particles, that produce or consume solute molecules, and that interact with each other through the long-range concentrations fields they generate. We analytically calculate the effective phoretic mobility of these particles when the mixture is submitted to a constant, external concentration gradient, at leading order in the overall concentration. Relying on a analogy with the modeling of strong electrolytes, we show that the effective phoretic mobility decays with the square-root of the concentration: our result is therefore a nonequilibrium counterpart to the celebrated Kohlrausch and Debye-H\"uckel-Onsager conductivity laws for electrolytes, which are extended here to particles with long-range nonreciprocal interactions. The effective mobility law we derive reveals the existence of a regime of maximal mobility, and could find applications in the description of nanoscale transport phenomena in living cells.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous assembly of condensate networks during the demixing of structured fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation, whereby two liquids spontaneously demix, is ubiquitous in industrial, environmental, and biological processes. While isotropic fluids are known to condense into spherical droplets in the binodal region, these dynamics are poorly understood for structured fluids. Here, we report the novel observation of condensate networks, which spontaneously assemble during the demixing of a mesogen from a solvent. Condensing mesogens form rapidly-elongating filaments, rather than spheres, to relieve distortion of a simultaneously-forming internal smectic mesophase. As filaments densify, they collapse into bulged discs, lowering the elastic free energy. Additional distortion is relieved by retraction of filaments into the bulged discs, which are straightened under tension to form a ramified network. Understanding and controlling these dynamics may provide new avenues to direct pattern formation or template materials.</description>

      <title>Confined run and tumble particles with non-Markovian tumbling statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confined active particles constitute simple, yet realistic, examples of systems that converge into a non-equilibrium steady state. We investigate a run-and-tumble particle in one spatial dimension, trapped by an external potential, with a given distribution $g(t)$ of waiting times between tumbling events whose mean value is equal to $\tau$. Unless $g(t)$ is an exponential distribution (corresponding to a constant tumbling rate), the process is non-Markovian, which makes the analysis of the model particularly challenging. We use an analytical framework involving effective position-dependent tumbling rates, to develop a numerical method that yields the full steady-state distribution (SSD) of the particle's position. The method is very efficient and requires modest computing resources, including in the large-deviations and/or small-$\tau$ regime, where the SSD can be related to the the large-deviation function, $s(x)$, via the scaling relation $P_{{\rm st}}(x)\sim e^{-s\left(x\right)/\tau}$.</description>
