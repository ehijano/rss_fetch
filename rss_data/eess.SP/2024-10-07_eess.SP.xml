      <title>Insightful Railway Track Evaluation: Leveraging NARX Feature Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of time series is essential for extracting meaningful insights and aiding decision-making in engineering domains. Parametric modeling techniques like NARX are invaluable for comprehending intricate processes, such as environmental time series, owing to their easily interpretable and transparent structures. This article introduces a classification algorithm, Logistic-NARX Multinomial, which merges the NARX methodology with logistic regression. This approach not only produces interpretable models but also effectively tackles challenges associated with multiclass classification. Furthermore, this study introduces an innovative methodology tailored for the railway sector, offering a tool by employing NARX models to interpret the multitude of features derived from onboard sensors. This solution provides profound insights through feature importance analysis, enabling informed decision-making regarding safety and maintenance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Numerical Calibration of Water Delivery Network Using Short-Burst Hydrant Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration is a critical process for reducing uncertainty in Water Distribution Network Hydraulic Models (WDN HM). However, features of certain WDNs, such as oversized pipelines, lead to shallow pressure gradients under normal daily conditions, posing a challenge for effective calibration. This study proposes a calibration methodology using short hydrant trials conducted at night, which increase the pressure gradient in the WDN. The data is resampled to align with hourly consumption patterns. In a unique real-world case study of a WDN zone, we demonstrate the statistically significant superiority of our method compared to calibration based on daily usage. The experimental methodology, inspired by a machine learning cross-validation framework, utilises two state-of-the-art calibration algorithms, achieving a reduction in absolute error of up to 45% in the best scenario.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Unobservable Components of Electricity Demand Response with Inverse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the electricity demand responses to prices are critical activities for system operators, retailers, and regulators. While conventional machine learning and time series analyses have been adequate for the routine demand patterns that have adapted only slowly over many years, the emergence of active consumers with flexible assets such as solar-plus-storage systems, and electric vehicles, introduces new challenges. These active consumers exhibit more complex consumption patterns, the drivers of which are often unobservable to the retailers and system operators. In practice, system operators and retailers can only monitor the net demand (metered at grid connection points), which reflects the overall energy consumption or production exchanged with the grid. As a result, all "behind-the-meter" activities-such as the use of flexibility-remain hidden from these entities. Such behind-the-meter behavior may be controlled by third party agents or incentivized by tariffs; in either case, the retailer's revenue and the system loads would be impacted by these activities behind the meter, but their details can only be inferred. We define the main components of net demand, as baseload, flexible, and self-generation, each having nonlinear responses to market price signals. As flexible demand response and self generation are increasing, this raises a pressing question of whether existing methods still perform well and, if not, whether there is an alternative way to understand and project the unobserved components of behavior. In response to this practical challenge, we evaluate the potential of a data-driven inverse optimization (IO) methodology. This approach characterizes decomposed consumption patterns without requiring direct observation of behind-the-meter behavior or device-level metering [...]</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach for User-Centric Clustering in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to conventional massive MIMO cellular configurations plagued by inter-cell interference, cell-free massive MIMO systems distribute network resources across the coverage area, enabling users to connect with multiple access points (APs) and boosting both system capacity and fairness across user. In such systems, one critical functionality is the association between APs and users: determining the optimal association is indeed a combinatorial problem of prohibitive complexity. In this paper, a solution based on deep learning is thus proposed to solve the user clustering problem aimed at maximizing the sum spectral efficiency while controlling the number of active connections. The proposed solution can scale effectively with the number of users, leveraging long short-term memory cells to operate without the need for retraining. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, even in the presence of imperfect channel state information due to pilot contamination.</description>

      <title>Raising the Bar(ometer): Identifying a User's Stair and Lift Usage Through Wearable Sensor Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many users are confronted multiple times daily with the choice of whether to take the stairs or the elevator. Whereas taking the stairs could be beneficial for cardiovascular health and wellness, taking the elevator might be more convenient but it also consumes energy. By precisely tracking and boosting users' stairs and elevator usage through their wearable, users might gain health insights and motivation, encouraging a healthy lifestyle and lowering the risk of sedentary-related health problems. This research describes a new exploratory dataset, to examine the patterns and behaviors related to using stairs and lifts. We collected data from 20 participants while climbing and descending stairs and taking a lift in a variety of scenarios. The aim is to provide insights and demonstrate the practicality of using wearable sensor data for such a scenario. Our collected dataset was used to train and test a Random Forest machine learning model, and the results show that our method is highly accurate at classifying stair and lift operations with an accuracy of 87.61% and a multi-class weighted F1-score of 87.56% over 8-second time windows. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of various types of sensors and data attributes on the model's performance. Our findings show that combining inertial and pressure sensors yields a viable solution for real-time activity detection.</description>

      <title>Toward Adaptive Tracking and Communication via an Airborne Maneuverable Bi-Static ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an airborne maneuverable bi-static integrated sensing and communication system where both the transmitter and receiver are unmanned aerial vehicles. By timely forming a dynamic bi-static range based on the motion information of the target, such a system can provide an adaptive two dimensional tracking and communication services. Towards this end, a trajectory optimization problem for both transmits and receive UAV is formulated to achieve high-accurate motion state estimation by minimizing the time-variant Cramer Rao bound, subject to the sufficient communication signal-to-noise ratio to maintain communication channel prediction error. Then we develop an efficient approach based on the successive convex approximation technique and the S-procedure to address the problem. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed airborne maneuverable bi-static ISAC system is able to obtain higher tracking accuracy compared with the static or semi-dynamic ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Development of a Digital Front-End for Electrooculography Circuits to Facilitate Digital Communication in Individuals with Communicative and Motor Disabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project developed a cost-effective, digital-viable front-end for electrooculography (EOG) circuits aimed at enabling communication for individuals with Locked-in Syndrome (LIS) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Using the TL072 operational amplifier, the system amplifies weak EOG signals and processes them through an Arduino Uno for real-time monitoring. The circuit includes preamplification, filtering between 0.1 Hz and 30 Hz, and final amplification stages, achieving accurate eye movement tracking with a 256 Hz sampling rate. The approach to this was described in detail, with a comparison drawn between the theoretical expectations of our circuit design and its viability in contrast to the actual values measured. Our readings aimed to create an interface that optimized max-gaze angle readings by outputting a maximum reading at values above the baseline theory of our amplification circuit. From this, we measured the latency between the serial output and action, analyzing video recordings of such readings. The Latency value read reached around 20ms, which is within the tolerance for proper communication and did not seriously affect the readings. Beyond this, challenges such as noise interference (with an SNR of 1.07 dB) remain despite achieving reliable signal amplification. This was during a test of the analog functionality of this circuit. However, its limitations mean that future improvements will focus on reducing environmental interference, optimizing electrode placement, applying a novel detection algorithm to optimize communication applications, and enhancing signal clarity to make the system more effective for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Towards TMA-Based Transmissive RIS Transceiver Enabled Downlink Communication Networks: A Consensus-ADMM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-stream downlink communication system that utilizes a transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) transceiver. Specifically, we elaborate the downlink communication scheme using time-modulated array (TMA) technology, which enables high order modulation and multi-stream beamforming. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plusnoise ratio (SINR) with user fairness, which takes into account the constraint of the maximum available power for each transmissive element. Due to the non-convex nature of the formulated problem,finding optimal solution is challenging. To mitigate the complexity,we propose a linear-complexity beamforming algorithm based on consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).Specifically, by introducing a set of auxiliary variables, the problem can be decomposed into multiple sub-problems that are amenable to parallel computation, where the each sub-problem can yield closed-form expressions, bringing a significant reduction in the computational complexity. The overall problem achieves convergence by iteratively addressing these sub-problems in an alternating manner. Finally, the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the impact of various parameter configurations on the system performance are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Allocation of Payload Code Rate and Header Copies in LR-FHSS Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03392v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of the LoRaWAN Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS) technique using a device-level probabilistic strategy for code rate and header replica allocation. Specifically, we investigate the effects of different header replica and code rate allocations at each end-device, guided by a probability distribution provided by the network server. As a benchmark, we compare the proposed strategy with the standardized LR-FHSS data rates DR8 and DR9. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy consistently outperforms the DR8 and DR9 standard data rates across all considered scenarios. Notably, our findings reveal that the optimal distribution rarely includes data rate DR9, while data rate DR8 significantly contributes to the goodput and energy efficiency optimizations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcenment Learning-Aided NOMA Random Access: An AoI-Based Timeliness Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03398v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the age-of-information (AoI) of a power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, where multiple internet-of-things (IoT) devices transmit to a common gateway in a grant-free random fashion. More specifically, we consider a framed setup composed of multiple time slots, and resort to the $Q$-learning algorithm to properly define, in a distributed manner, the time slot and the power level each IoT device transmits within a frame. In the proposed AoI-QL-NOMA scheme, the $Q$-learning reward is adapted with the aim of minimizing the average AoI of the network, while only requiring a single feedback bit per time slot, in a frame basis. Our results show that AoI-QL-NOMA significantly improves the AoI performance compared to some recently proposed schemes, without significantly reducing the network throughput.</description>

      <title>Aircraft Radar Altimeter Interference Mitigation Through a CNN-Layer Only Denoising Autoencoder Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising autoencoders for signal processing applications have been shown to experience significant difficulty in learning to reconstruct radio frequency communication signals, particularly in the large sample regime. In communication systems, this challenge is primarily due to the need to reconstruct the modulated data stream which is generally highly stochastic in nature. In this work, we take advantage of this limitation by using the denoising autoencoder to instead remove interfering radio frequency communication signals while reconstructing highly structured FMCW radar signals. More specifically, in this work we show that a CNN-layer only autoencoder architecture can be utilized to improve the accuracy of a radar altimeter's ranging estimate even in severe interference environments consisting of a multitude of interference signals. This is demonstrated through comprehensive performance analysis of an end-to-end FMCW radar altimeter simulation with and without the convolutional layer-only autoencoder. The proposed approach significantly improves interference mitigation in the presence of both narrow-band tone interference as well as wideband QPSK interference in terms of range RMS error, number of false altitude reports, and the peak-to-sidelobe ratio of the resulting range profile. FMCW radar signals of up to 40,000 IQ samples can be reliably reconstructed.</description>

      <title>Authentication by Location Tracking in Underwater Acoustic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical layer message authentication in underwater acoustic networks (UWANs) leverages the characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel (UWAC) as a fingerprint of the transmitting device. However, as the device moves its UWAC changes, and the authentication mechanism must track such variations. In this paper, we propose a context-based authentication mechanism operating in two steps: first, we estimate the position of the underwater device, then we predict its future position based on the previously estimated ones. To check the authenticity of the transmission, we compare the estimated and the predicted position. The location is estimated using a convolutional neural network taking as input the sample covariance matrix of the estimated UWACs. The prediction uses either a Kalman filter or a recurrent neural network (RNN). The authentication check is performed on the squared error between the predicted and estimated positions. The solution based on the Kalman filter outperforms that built on the RNN when the device moves according to a correlated Gauss-Markov mobility model, which reproduces a typical underwater motion.</description>

      <title>On Secret-Message Transmission by Echoing Encrypted Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scheme for secure communications, called ``Secret-message Transmission by Echoing Encrypted Probes (STEEP)'', is revisited. STEEP is a round-trip scheme with a probing phase from one user to another and an echoing phase in the reverse direction. STEEP is broadly applicable to yield a positive secrecy rate in bits per channel use even if the receive channels at eavesdropper (Eve) are stronger than those between legitimate users in both directions. Differing from prior cases of STEEP, this paper presents STEEP in each of the following settings: using Gaussian channel probing (GCP) and Gaussian linear encryption (GLE) over MIMO channels; using phase-shift-keying (PSK) channel probing and PSK nonlinear encryption over SISO channels; and using GCP and GLE over multiple access channels. In each setting, Eve is assumed to have any number of antennas, and STEEP is shown to yield a positive secrecy rate subject to a sufficiently large power in the echoing phase relative to the power in the probing phase, as long as Eve's receive channel in the probing phase is not noiseless. Also shown is that the GCP-GLE based STEEP for two users, subject to a form of large powers from the users, has its secrecy rate approaching the secret-key capacity based on GCP.</description>

      <title>Optimizing food taste sensory evaluation through neural network-based taste electroencephalogram channel selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The taste electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked by the taste stimulation can reflect different brain patterns and be used in applications such as sensory evaluation of food. However, considering the computational cost and efficiency, EEG data with many channels has to face the critical issue of channel selection. This paper proposed a channel selection method called class activation mapping with attention (CAM-Attention). The CAM-Attention method combined a convolutional neural network with channel and spatial attention (CNN-CSA) model with a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) model. The CNN-CSA model exploited key features in EEG data by attention mechanism, and the Grad-CAM model effectively realized the visualization of feature regions. Then, channel selection was effectively implemented based on feature regions. Finally, the CAM-Attention method reduced the computational burden of taste EEG recognition and effectively distinguished the four tastes. In short, it has excellent recognition performance and provides effective technical support for taste sensory evaluation.</description>

      <title>Effective Intrusion Detection for UAV Communications using Autoencoder-based Feature Extraction and Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection method for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the presence of recent actual UAV intrusion dataset. In particular, in the first stage of our method, we design an autoencoder architecture for effectively extracting important features, which are then fed into various machine learning models in the second stage for detecting and classifying attack types. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose such the autoencoder-based machine learning intrusion detection method for UAVs using actual dataset, while most of existing works only consider either simulated datasets or datasets irrelevant to UAV communications. Our experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines such as feature selection schemes in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Autoencoder Encodings for ECG Representation in Downstream Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an inexpensive and widely available tool for cardiovascular assessment. Despite its standardized format and small file size, the high complexity and inter-individual variability of ECG signals (typically a 60,000-size vector) make it challenging to use in deep learning models, especially when only small datasets are available. This study addresses these challenges by exploring feature generation methods from representative beat ECGs, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders to reduce data complexity. We introduce three novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) variants: Stochastic Autoencoder (SAE), Annealed beta-VAE (Abeta-VAE), and cyclical beta-VAE (Cbeta-VAE), and compare their effectiveness in maintaining signal fidelity and enhancing downstream prediction tasks. The Abeta-VAE achieved superior signal reconstruction, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) to 15.7 plus-minus 3.2 microvolts, which is at the level of signal noise. Moreover, the SAE encodings, when combined with ECG summary features, improved the prediction of reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.901. This performance nearly matches the 0.910 AUROC of state-of-the-art CNN models but requires significantly less data and computational resources. Our findings demonstrate that these VAE encodings are not only effective in simplifying ECG data but also provide a practical solution for applying deep learning in contexts with limited-scale labeled training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In future wireless systems of beyond 5G and 6G, addressing diverse applications with varying quality requirements is essential. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architectures offer the potential for dynamic resource adaptation based on traffic demands. However, achieving real-time resource orchestration remains a challenge. Simultaneously, Digital Twin (DT) technology holds promise for testing and analysing complex systems, offering a unique platform for addressing dynamic operation and automation in O-RAN architectures. Yet, developing DTs for complex 5G/6G networks poses challenges, including data exchanges, ML model training data availability, network dynamics, processing power limitations, interdisciplinary collaboration needs, and a lack of standardized methodologies. This paper provides an overview of Open RAN architecture, trend and challenges, proposing the DT concepts for O-RAN with solution examples showcasing its integration into the framework.</description>

      <title>A Simple Method for Secret-Key Generation Between Mobile Users Across Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two or more mobiles users can continuously superimpose sequences of bits chosen from different packets or files already exchanged and authenticated between themselves to continuously renew a secret key for continuous strengthening of their privacy and authentication. This accumulative, adaptable and additive (AAA) method is discussed in this paper. The equivocation to Eve of any bit in the generated key by the AAA method equals to the probability that not all corresponding independent bits exchanged between the users are intercepted by Eve. This performance, achieved without using any knowledge of non-stationary probabilities of bits being intercepted by Eve, is compared to an established capacity achievable using that knowledge. A secrecy robustness of the AAA method against some correlations known to Eve is also discussed.</description>

      <title>MRI quantification of liver fibrosis using diamagnetic susceptibility: An ex-vivo feasibility study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In chronic liver disease, liver fibrosis develops as excessive deposition of extracellular matrix macromolecules, predominantly collagens, progressively form fibrous scars that disrupt the hepatic architecture, and fibrosis, iron, and fat are interrelated. Fibrosis is the best predictor of morbidity and mortality in chronic liver disease but liver biopsy, the reference method for diagnosis and staging, is invasive and limited by sampling and interobserver variability and risks of complications. The overall objective of this study was to develop a new non-invasive method to quantify fibrosis using diamagnetic susceptibility sources with histology validation in ex vivo liver explants.</description>

      <title>Remaining Useful Life Prediction: A Study on Multidimensional Industrial Signal Processing and Efficient Transfer Learning Based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is crucial for maintaining modern industrial systems, where equipment reliability and operational safety are paramount. Traditional methods, based on small-scale deep learning or physical/statistical models, often struggle with complex, multidimensional sensor data and varying operating conditions, limiting their generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative regression framework utilizing large language models (LLMs) for RUL prediction. By leveraging the modeling power of LLMs pre-trained on corpus data, the proposed model can effectively capture complex temporal dependencies and improve prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on the Turbofan engine's RUL prediction task show that the proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the challenging FD002 and FD004 subsets and achieves near-SOTA results on the other subsets. Notably, different from previous research, our framework uses the same sliding window length and all sensor signals for all subsets, demonstrating strong consistency and generalization. Moreover, transfer learning experiments reveal that with minimal target domain data for fine-tuning, the model outperforms SOTA methods trained on full target domain data. This research highlights the significant potential of LLMs in industrial signal processing and RUL prediction, offering a forward-looking solution for health management in future intelligent industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Manikin-Recorded Cardiopulmonary Sounds Dataset Using Digital Stethoscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heart and lung sounds are crucial for healthcare monitoring. Recent improvements in stethoscope technology have made it possible to capture patient sounds with enhanced precision. In this dataset, we used a digital stethoscope to capture both heart and lung sounds, including individual and mixed recordings. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to offer both separate and mixed cardiorespiratory sounds. The recordings were collected from a clinical manikin, a patient simulator designed to replicate human physiological conditions, generating clean heart and lung sounds at different body locations. This dataset includes both normal sounds and various abnormalities (i.e., murmur, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, atrioventricular block, third and fourth heart sound, wheezing, crackles, rhonchi, pleural rub, and gurgling sounds). The dataset includes audio recordings of chest examinations performed at different anatomical locations, as determined by specialist nurses. Each recording has been enhanced using frequency filters to highlight specific sound types. This dataset is useful for applications in artificial intelligence, such as automated cardiopulmonary disease detection, sound classification, unsupervised separation techniques, and deep learning algorithms related to audio signal processing.</description>

      <title>Communication Constellation Design of Minimum Number of Satellites with Continuous Coverage and Inter-Satellite Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the advancement of research on distributed space systems that operate a large number of satellites as a single system urges the need for the investigation of satellite constellations. The communication constellation can be used to construct global or regional communication networks using inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite links. This paper studies the two challenges of the communication constellation, continuous coverage and inter-satellite link connectivity. The bounded Voronoi diagram and APC decomposition are presented as continuous coverage analysis methods. For the continuity analysis of the inter-satellite link, the relative motion between the adjacent orbital planes derives the analytic solutions. The Walker-Delta constellation and common ground-track constellation design methods are introduced as examples to verify the analysis methods. The common ground-track constellation is classified into a quasi-symmetric and optimal constellation. The optimal common ground-track constellation is optimized by the BILP algorithm. As a result, the simulation results compare the performance of the communication constellations according to various design methods.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of 6TiSCH Networks Using Discrete Events Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03383v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) empowers small devices to sense, react, and communicate, with applications ranging from smart ordinary household objects to complex industrial processes. To provide access to an increasing number of IoT devices, particularly in long-distance communication scenarios, a robust low-power wide area network (LPWAN) protocol becomes essential. A widely adopted protocol for this purpose is 6TiSCH, which builds upon the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It introduces time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode as a new medium access control (MAC) layer operating mode, in conjunction with IEEE 802.15.4g, which also defines both MAC and physical layer (PHY) layers and provides IPv6 connectivity for LPWAN. Notably, 6TiSCH has gained adoption in significant standards such as Wireless Intelligent Ubiquitous Networks (Wi-SUN). This study evaluates the scalability of 6TiSCH, with a focus on key parameters such as queue size, the maximum number of single-hop retries, and the slotframe length. Computational simulations were performed using an open-source simulator and obtained the following results: increasing the transmission queue size, along with adjusting the number of retries and slotframe length, leads to a reduction in the packet error rate (PER). Notably, the impact of the number of retries is particularly pronounced. Furthermore, the effect on latency varies based on the specific combination of these parameters as the network scales.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Aided Secure Transmission for RIS-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have the issue of secrecy leakage when using the ISAC waveforms for sensing, thus posing a potential risk for eavesdropping. To address this problem, we propose to employ movable antennas (MAs) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance the physical layer security (PLS) performance of ISAC systems, where an eavesdropping target potentially wiretaps the signals transmitted by the base station (BS). To evaluate the synergistic performance gain provided by MAs and RIS, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the sum-rate of the users by jointly optimizing the transmit/receive beamformers of the BS, the reflection coefficients of the RIS, and the positions of MAs at communication users, subject to a minimum communication rate requirement for each user, a minimum radar sensing requirement, and a maximum secrecy leakage to the eavesdropping target. To solve this non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, a two-layer penalty-based algorithm is developed by updating the penalty parameter in the outer-layer iterations to achieve a trade-off between the optimality and feasibility of the solution. In the inner-layer iterations, the auxiliary variables are first obtained with semi-closed-form solutions using Lagrange duality. Then, the receive beamformer filter at the BS is optimized by solving a Rayleigh-quotient subproblem. Subsequently, the transmit beamformer matrix is obtained by solving a convex subproblem. Finally, the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm is employed to optimize the RIS reflection coefficients and the positions of MAs. Extensive simulation results validate the considerable benefits of the proposed MAs-aided RIS-ISAC systems in enhancing security performance compared to traditional fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems.</description>

      <title>S7: Selective and Simplified State Space Layers for Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in sequence modeling is efficiently handling tasks with extended contexts. While recent state-space models (SSMs) have made significant progress in this area, they often lack input-dependent filtering or require substantial increases in model complexity to handle input variability. We address this gap by introducing S7, a simplified yet powerful SSM that can handle input dependence while incorporating stable reparameterization and specific design choices to dynamically adjust state transitions based on input content, maintaining efficiency and performance. We prove that this reparameterization ensures stability in long-sequence modeling by keeping state transitions well-behaved over time. Additionally, it controls the gradient norm, enabling efficient training and preventing issues like exploding or vanishing gradients. S7 significantly outperforms baselines across various sequence modeling tasks, including neuromorphic event-based datasets, Long Range Arena benchmarks, and various physical and biological time series. Overall, S7 offers a more straightforward approach to sequence modeling without relying on complex, domain-specific inductive biases, achieving significant improvements across key benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CSI Acquisition in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Surveillance Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) surveillance system, in which multiple multi-antenna monitoring nodes (MNs) are deployed in either observing or jamming mode to disrupt the communication between a multi-antenna untrusted pair. We propose a simple and effective channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme at the MNs. Specifically, our approach leverages pilot signals in both the uplink and downlink phases of the untrusted link, coupled with minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation. This enables the MNs to accurately estimate the effective channels to both the untrusted transmitter (UT) and untrusted receiver (UR), thereby yielding robust monitoring performance. We analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the untrusted links and of the monitoring system, taking into account the proposed CSI acquisition and successive MMSE cancellation schemes. The monitoring success probability (MSP) is then derived. Simulation results show that the CF-mMIMO surveillance system, relying on the proposed CSI acquisition scheme, can achieve monitoring performance close to that achieved by having perfect CSI knowledge of the untrusted link (theoretical upper bound), especially when the number of MNs is large.</description>

      <title>Robust Quickest Correlation Change Detection in High-Dimensional Random Vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting changes in high-dimensional vectors presents significant challenges, especially when the post-change distribution is unknown and time-varying. This paper introduces a novel robust algorithm for correlation change detection in high-dimensional data. The approach utilizes the summary statistic of the maximum magnitude correlation coefficient to detect the change. This summary statistic captures the level of correlation present in the data but also has an asymptotic density. The robust test is designed using the asymptotic density. The proposed approach is robust because it can help detect a change in correlation level from some known level to unknown, time-varying levels. The proposed test is also computationally efficient and valid for a broad class of data distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on simulated data.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-Band Integrated Sensing and Communications: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) wireless networks aim to achieve ultra-high data transmission rates, very low latency and enhanced energy-efficiency. To this end, terahertz (THz) band is one of the key enablers of 6G to meet such requirements. The THz-band systems are also quickly emerging as high-resolution sensing devices because of their ultra-wide bandwidth and very narrow beamwidth. As a means to efficiently utilize spectrum and thereby save cost and power, THz integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigm envisages a single integrated hardware platform with a common signaling mechanism. However, ISAC at THz-band entails several design challenges such as beam split, range-dependent bandwidth, near-field beamforming, and distinct channel model. This article examines the technologies that have the potential to bring forth ISAC and THz transmission together. In particular, it provides an overview of antenna and array design, hybrid beamforming, integration with reflecting surfaces and data-driven techniques such as machine learning. These systems also provide research opportunities in developing novel methodologies for channel estimation, near-field beam split, waveform design, and beam misalignment.</description>

      <title>Semantic-aware Sampling and Transmission in Energy Harvesting Systems: A POMDP Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06522v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of real-time remote tracking of a partially observable Markov source in an energy harvesting system with an unreliable communication channel. We consider both sampling and transmission costs. Different from most prior studies that assume the source is fully observable, the sampling cost renders the source partially observable. The goal is to jointly optimize sampling and transmission policies for two semantic-aware metrics: i) a general distortion measure and ii) the age of incorrect information (AoII). We formulate a stochastic control problem. To solve the problem for each metric, we cast a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is transformed into a belief MDP. Then, for both AoII under the perfect channel setup and distortion, we express the belief as a function of the age of information (AoI). This expression enables us to effectively truncate the corresponding belief space and formulate a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved using the relative value iteration algorithm. For the AoII metric in the general setup, a deep reinforcement learning policy is proposed to solve the belief MDP problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the derived policies and, in particular, reveal a non-monotonic switching-type structure of the real-time optimal policy with respect to AoI.</description>

      <title>Efficient Matrix Factorization Via Householder Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by orthogonal dictionary learning problems, we propose a novel method for matrix factorization, where the data matrix $\mathbf{Y}$ is a product of a Householder matrix $\mathbf{H}$ and a binary matrix $\mathbf{X}$. First, we show that the exact recovery of the factors $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ from $\mathbf{Y}$ is guaranteed with $\Omega(1)$ columns in $\mathbf{Y}$ . Next, we show approximate recovery (in the $l\infty$ sense) can be done in polynomial time($O(np)$) with $\Omega(\log n)$ columns in $\mathbf{Y}$ . We hope the techniques in this work help in developing alternate algorithms for orthogonal dictionary learning.</description>

      <title>Automating the Design of Multi-band Microstrip Antennas via Uniform Cross-Entropy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automating the design of microstrip antennas has been an active area of research for the past decade. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) or, more recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a number of work have demonstrated the possibility of producing non-trivial antenna geometries that can be efficient in terms of area utilization or be used in complex multi-frequency-band scenarios. However, both GAs and DNNs are notoriously compute-expensive, often requiring hour-long run times in order to produce new antenna geometries. In this paper, we propose to explore the novel use of Cross-Entropy optimization as a Monte-Carlo sampling technique for optimizing the geometry of patch antennas given a target $S_{11}$ scattering parameter curve that a user wants to obtain. We compare our proposed Uniform Cross-Entropy (UCE) method against other popular Monte-Carlo optimization techniques such as Gaussian Processes, Forest optimization and baseline random search approaches. We demonstrate that the proposed UCE technique outperforms the competing methods while still having a reasonable compute complexity, taking around 16 minutes to converge. Finally, our code is released as open-source with the hope of being useful to future research.</description>

      <title>Online Similarity-and-Independence-Aware Beamformer for Low-latency Target Sound Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an online target sound extraction (TSE) process using the similarity-and-independence-aware beamformer (SIBF) derived from an iterative batch algorithm. The study aimed to reduce latency while maintaining extraction accuracy. The SIBF, which is a linear method, provides more accurate estimates of the target than an approximate magnitude spectrogram reference. The transition to an online algorithm reduces latency but presents challenges. First, contrary to the conventional assumption, deriving the online algorithm may degrade accuracy as compared to the batch algorithm using a sliding window. Second, conventional post-processing methods intended for scaling the estimated target may widen the accuracy gap between the two algorithms. This study adopts an approach that addresses these challenges and minimizes the accuracy gap during post-processing. It proposes a novel scaling method based on the single-channel Wiener filter (SWF-based scaling). To further improve accuracy, the study introduces a modified version of the time-frequency-varying variance generalized Gaussian distribution as a source model to represent the joint probability between the target and reference. Experimental results using the CHiME-3 dataset demonstrate several key findings: 1) SWF-based scaling effectively eliminates the gap between the two algorithms and improves accuracy. 2) The new source model achieves optimal accuracy, corresponding to the Laplacian model. 3) Our online SIBF outperforms conventional linear TSE methods, including independent vector extraction and minimum mean square error beamforming. These findings can contribute to the fields of beamforming and blind source separation.</description>

      <title>MMSE Channel Estimation in Large-Scale MIMO: Improved Robustness with Reduced Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale MIMO systems with a massive number N of individually controlled antennas pose significant challenges for minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation, based on uplink pilots. The major ones arise from the computational complexity, which scales with $N^3$, and from the need for accurate knowledge of the channel statistics. This paper aims to address both challenges by introducing reduced-complexity channel estimation methods that achieve the performance of MMSE in terms of estimation accuracy and uplink spectral efficiency while demonstrating improved robustness in practical scenarios where channel statistics must be estimated. This is achieved by exploiting the inherent structure of the spatial correlation matrix induced by the array geometry. Specifically, we use a Kronecker decomposition for uniform planar arrays and a well-suited circulant approximation for uniform linear arrays. By doing so, a significantly lower computational complexity is achieved, scaling as $N\sqrt{N}$ and $N\log N$ for squared planar arrays and linear arrays, respectively.</description>
