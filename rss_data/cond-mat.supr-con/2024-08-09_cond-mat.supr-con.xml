      <title>Constraints on superconducting pairing in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the recently discovered altermagnetic materials hosts large prospects for both fundamental physics and technological applications. In this work we show that a characteristic spin-sublattice locking in altermagnets puts severe constraints on possible superconducting pairing. In particular, we uncover that the most common form of superconductivity, uniform $s$-wave spin-singlet pairing is not possible to achieve in altermagnets. Considering an effective model for a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet on a square lattice, we instead find that the most likely forms of spin-singlet pairing have $d_{x^2-y^2}$- or extended $s$-wave symmetry. We also find that the simplest form of equal-spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing is not allowed, but it can only exist as a mixed-spin-triplet $p$-wave state. We verify these constraints on pairing within an interaction-induced model of altermagnetism, where we also establish their validity for finite-momentum pairing. Additionally we discuss the possible pairing symmetries for odd-frequency superconducting pairing. Due to the generality of our results, they are applicable to both intrinsic superconductivity and proximity-induced superconductivity in altermagnet-superconductor hybrid junctions.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Liquid Theory of Non-S-Wave Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures present the Fermi-liquid theory of superconductivity, which is applicable to a broad range of systems that are candidates for non-s wave pairing, {\it e.g.} the heavy fermions, organic metals and the CuO superconductors. Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory provides an important link between experimental properties of non-s wave superconductors and the more general Fermi-liquid theory. The multiple superconducting phases of UPt$_3$ provide an ideal example of the role that is played by the GL theory for non-s wave superconductors. The difference between non-s wave superconductivity and conventional anisotropic superconductivity is illustrated here by the unique effects that impurities are predicted to have on the properties of non-s wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Characteristic times for gap relaxation and heat escape in nanothin NbTi superconducting filaments: thickness dependence and effect of substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the temporal voltage response of NbTi superconducting filaments with varied nanoscale thicknesses to step current pulses that induce non-equilibrium superconducting states governed by a hot-spot mechanism. Such detected voltage emerges after a delay time td, which is intimately connected to the gap relaxation and heat escape times. By employing time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory to link the delay time to the applied current, we determined that the gap relaxation time depends linearly on film thickness, aligning with the acoustic mismatch theory for phonon transmission at the superconductor-substrate interface. We thereby find a gap relaxation time of 104 ps per nm of thickness for NbTi films on polished sapphire. We further show that interfacial interaction with the substrate significantly impacts the gap relaxation time, with observed values of 9 ns on SiOx, 6.8 ns on fused silica, and 5.2 ns on sapphire for a 50 nm thick NbTi strip at T = 5.75 K. These insights are valuable for optimizing superconducting sensing technologies, particularly the single-photon detectors that operate in the transient regime of nanothin superconducting bridges and filaments</description>

      <title>Quantum spin liquid from electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an exotic insulating phase with emergent gauge fields and fractionalized excitations. However, the unambiguous demonstration of the existence of a QSL in a "non-engineered" microscopic model (or in any material) remains challenging. Here, using numerically-exact sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a QSL arises in a non-engineered electron-phonon model. Specifically, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a 2D triangular lattice at half filling (one electron per site) which we show includes a QSL phase which is fully gapped, exhibits no symmetry-breaking order, and supports deconfined fractionalized holon excitations. This suggests new routes for finding QSLs in realistic materials and high-$T_c$ superconductivity by lightly doping them.</description>

      <title>Generalized Josephson effect with arbitrary periodicity in quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Easy-plane quantum magnets are strikingly similar to superconductors, allowing for spin supercurrent and an effective superconducting phase stemming from their $U(1)$ rotation symmetry around the $z$-axis. We uncover a generalized fractional Josephson effect with a periodicity that increases linearly with system size in one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ chains at selected anisotropies and phase-fixing boundary fields. The effect combines arbitrary integer periodicities in a single system, exceeding the $4\pi $ and $8\pi $ periodicity of superconducting Josephson effects of Majorana zero modes and other exotic quasiparticles. We reveal a universal energy-phase relation and connect the effect to the recently discovered phantom helices.</description>

      <title>Quantum-metric-induced giant and reversible nonreciprocal transport phenomena in chiral loop-current phases of kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rich spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomena with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. The emergence of chiral loop-current order, accompanied by time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in various kagome metals, has garnered significant attention as a novel quantum topological state. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) in CsV3Sb5 [Guo et al, Nature 611, 461 (2022)], which provides compelling evidence of TRS and inversion-symmetry breaking. However, the underlying essence of this observation has remained obscured due to the lack of theoretical understanding. Here, we identify that the chiral loop-current induces substantial and switchable eMChA in kagome metals by taking account of the experimentally observed stripe charge-density-wave. The obtained eMChA coefficient is $\gamma_{eM}\propto M_{orb} \tau$, where $M_{orb}$ is the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization and $\tau$ is the lifetime of conduction electrons. Importantly, giant eMChA arises from the quantum metric (QM), which defines essential quantum phases of matter and their unique functionalities, including nonlinear effects. This effect is resonantly amplified in the loop-current phase, and the derived eMChA is switched by minute magnetic fields. This research elucidates the fundamental symmetry breaking in kagome metals and also sets the stage for investigating the QM-induced phenomena arising from electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Hall effects in a quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that electronic correlation, geometric frustration, and topology, \textit{individually}, can facilitate the emergence of various intriguing properties that have attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. Here, we report a systematic investigation on a quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$. A series of unconventional Hall effects are observed. In the paramagnetic phase, signature of dynamic $c$-$f$ hybridization is revealed by a reduction of anomalous Hall effect and is connected to frustration-promoted incoherent Kondo scattering. A large topological Hall effect exceeding 0.2 $\mu\Omega$ cm is found at low temperatures, which should be ascribed to the noncolinear magnetic structures of the frustrated quasi-kagome lattice. In addition, a peculiar loop-shaped Hall effect with switching chirality is also seen, which is inferred to be associated with magnetic domain walls that pin history-dependent spin chirality and / or Fermi-arc surface states projected from the in-gap Weyl nodes. These exotic results place Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$ in a regime of highly-frustrated antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice with a nontrivial topology on an ``extended" global phase diagram, and highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, geometric frustration and topology.</description>

      <title>Imprinting Ground State Chirality on Adatom Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative experimental protocol for the detection of doped Chern insulators and chiral superconductors. Our approach relies on coupling the target chiral system to adatom spins. Due to the substrate chirality, the adatom spins are expected to order in a noncoplanar configuration with a nonzero spin chirality. Here, we obtain concrete results for chiral substrates which are invariant under arbitrary spin rotations, and are coupled to three adatoms carrying classical moments. By exploring all the accessible magnetic ground states, we identify the regimes in which nonzero spin chirality is induced on the adatom complex. We apply our method to valley-polarized bilayer graphene and $d+id$ superconductors, and find qualitatively different ground state diagrams. Our analysis shows that the adatom spin chirality fully encodes the properties of the substrate chirality.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid state in $T$*-type La$_{1-x/2}$Eu$_{1-x/2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ revealed via element substitution effects on magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.03529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its unique structural features, the magnetism of single-layered cuprate with five oxygen coordination ($T$*-type structure) has not been investigated thus far. Here, we report the results of muon spin relaxation and magnetic susceptibility measurements to elucidate the magnetism of $T$*-type La$_{1-x/2}$Eu$_{1-x/2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LESCO) via magnetic Fe- and non-magnetic Zn-substitution. We clarified the inducement of the spin-glass (SG)-like magnetically ordered state in La$_{1-x/2}$Eu$_{1-x/2}$Sr$_x$Cu$_y$Fe$_{1-y}$O$_4$ with $x = 0.24 + y$, and the non-magnetic state in La$_{1-x/2}$Eu$_{1-x/2}$Sr$_x$Cu$_y$Zn$_{1-y}$O$_4$ with $x$ = 0.24 after the suppression of superconductivity for $y$ $\geq$ 0.025. The SG state lies below $\sim$7 K in a wide Sr concentration range between 0.19 and 0.34 in 5$\%$ Fe-substituted LESCO. The short-range SG state is consistent with that originating from the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in a metallic state. Thus, the results provide the first evidence for Fermi liquid (FL) state in the pristine $T$*-type LESCO. Taking into account the results of an oxygen $K$-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurement $[$J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 89, 075002 (2020)$]$ reporting the actual hole concentrations in LESCO, our results demonstrate the existence of the FL state in a lower hole-concentration region, compared to that in $T$-type La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. The emergence of the FL state in a lower hole-concentration region is possibly associated with a smaller charge transfer gap energy in the parent material with five oxygen coordination.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal electrodynamics and the penetration depth of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal quasiparticles in a clean type-II superconductor with line nodes give rise to a quadratic low-temperature change of the penetration depth, $\Delta \lambda \sim T^2$, as first shown by Kosztin and Leggett [I. Kosztin and A. J. Leggett, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 135 (1997)]. Here, we generalize this result to multiple nodes and compare it to numerically exact evaluations of the temperature-dependent penetration depth in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using a high-precision tight-binding model. We compare the calculations to recent penetration depth measurements in high purity single crystals of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ [J. F. Landaeta et al., arXiv:2312.05129]. When assuming the order parameter to have $\mathrm{B}_{1\mathrm{g}}$ symmetry, we find that both a simple $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and complicated gap structures with contributions from higher harmonics and accidental nodes can accommodate the experimental data.</description>

      <title>$T_c$ and the elastocaloric effect of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under $\langle 110 \rangle$ uniaxial stress: no indications of transition splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that the superconductivity of Sr2RuO4 has two components. Among this evidence is a jump in the shear elastic modulus $c_{66}$ at the critical temperature $T_c$, observed in ultrasound measurements. Such a jump is forbidden for homogeneous single-component order parameters, and implies that $T_c$ should develop as a cusp under the application of shear strain with $\langle 110 \rangle$ principal axes. This shear strain should split the onset temperatures of the two components, if they coexist, or select one component if they do not. Here, we report measurements of $T_c$ and the elastocaloric effect of Sr2RuO4 under uniaxial stress applied along the $[110]$ lattice direction. Within experimental resolution, we resolve neither a cusp in the stress dependence of $T_c$, nor any second transition in the elastocaloric effect data. We show that reconciling these null results with the observed jumps in $c_{66}$ requires extraordinarily fine tuning to a triple point of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter space. In addition, our results are inconsistent with homogeneous time reversal symmetry breaking at a temperature $T_2 \leq T_c$ as identified in muon spin relaxation experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnonic $\varphi$ Josephson junctions and synchronized precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian physics. One of its main goals is to engineer dissipation and to explore ensuing functionality. In magnonics, the effect of dissipation due to local damping on magnon transport has been explored. However, the effects of non-local damping on the magnonic analog of the Josephson effect remain missing, despite that non-local damping is inevitable and has been playing a central role in magnonics. Here, we uncover theoretically that a surprisingly rich dynamics can emerge in magnetic junctions due to intrinsic non-local damping, using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, under microwave pumping, we show that coherent spin precession in the right and left insulating ferromagnet (FM) of the junction becomes synchronized by non-local damping and thereby a magnonic analog of the $\varphi$ Josephson junction emerges, where $\varphi$ stands here for the relative precession phase of right and left FM in the stationary limit. Remarkably, $\varphi$ decreases monotonically from $ \pi$ to $\pi/2$ as the magnon-magnon interaction, arising from spin anisotropies, increases. Moreover, we also find a magnonic diode effect giving rise to rectification of magnon currents. Our predictions are readily testable with current device and measurement technologies at room temperatures.</description>
