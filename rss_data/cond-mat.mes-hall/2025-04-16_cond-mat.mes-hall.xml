      <title>Shuttling Majorana zero modes in disordered and noisy topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections ("piano keys") of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this piano key transport on a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. For disorder, we show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap. When the disorder is spatially correlated, we demonstrate that this leads to an increase in the diabatic error due to a further suppression of the minimum bulk energy gap and highlight the scaling of this suppression with the piano key size. For noise, we illustrate that the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.</description>

      <title>Bulk Hydrodynamic Transport in Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of collective longitudinal modes, plasmons, in bulk hydrodynamic transport in Weyl semimetals is explored. In contrast to graphene, where these modes are gapless, plasmons in Weyl semimetals are gapped. This gap, however, can be made arbitrarily small by decreasing the temperature or the chemical potential, making plasmon modes thermally accessible, both in thermodynamics and transport. In very clean Weyl semimetals near charge-neutrality where the plasmon gap is minimal, we find that they leave an imprint in the thermal conductivity and the viscosity.</description>

      <title>Planar Hall effect in ultrathin topological insulator films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Hall effect (PHE), previously observed in Weyl and Dirac semimetals due to the chiral anomaly, emerges with a different origin in topological insulators (TIs), where in-plane magnetic fields induce resistivity anisotropy. In strictly two-dimensional TIs, PHE is generally suppressed due to the inability of the out-of-plane Berry curvature to couple to the in-plane band velocity of the charge carriers. Here, we demonstrate that in ultrathin TI films, a quasi-two-dimensional system, intersurface tunneling coupling with in-plane magnetization induces electronic anisotropy, enabling a finite PHE. In addition, we reveal that strong in-plane magnetization can stabilize the thickness-dependent quantum anomalous Hall effect, typically associated with out-of-plane magnetization. These insights advance the understanding of magnetic topological phases, paving the way for next-generation spintronic devices and magnetic sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Chiral Domain Walls Induced by Radially Magnetized Nanotube Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate chiral domain walls (DWs) formed in radially magnetized nanotubes with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Unlike tubes with an easy axis of magnetization oriented in other directions, radially magnetized tubes exhibit geometrical effects arising not only from exchange interactions but also from magnetostatic interactions, which lead to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)-like effects. We derive expressions for the effective magnetic fields acting on DWs within PMA nanotubes and quantify SOT-driven DW motion using an analytical one-dimensional model, which is validated by micromagnetic simulations. Our results show that the DMI-like field due to magnetostatic interactions can be as significantly as the contribution of the material-induced DMI in nanotubes with diameters below 100$\,$nm. This implies that the direction and speed of DW motion in PMA nanotubes could differ from those observed in nanoribbons composed of the same material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DW velocity can be effectively controlled by adjusting the tube diameter and exchange stiffness constant of the magnetic layer, rather than relying solely on the material-induced DMI. These insights are expected to greatly expand the potential applications of PMA nanotube-based DW devices.</description>

      <title>Effective Theory of Ultrafast Skyrmion Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced ultrafast skyrmion nucleation has been experimentally demonstrated in several materials. So far, atomistic models have been used to corroborate experimental results. However, such simulations do not provide a simple intuitive understanding of the underlying physics. Here, we propose a coarse-grained effective theory where skyrmions can be nucleated or annihilated by thermal activation over energy barriers. Evaluating these two processes during a heat pulse shows good agreement with atomistic spin dynamics simulations and experiments while drastically reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the effective theory provides a direct guide for experimentally optimizing the number of nucleated skyrmions. Interestingly, the model also predicts a novel pathway for ultrafast annihilation of skyrmions. Our results pave the way for a deeper understanding of ultrafast nanomagnetism and the role of non-equilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Weyl-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction revisited: imaginary-time formalism and finite temperature effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals provide a platform for investigating the interplay among magnetism, inversion symmetry breaking, and topologically nontrivial Weyl fermions. The Weyl-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction may be related to the magnetic orders observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals. Previous studies of RKKY interaction between magnetic impurities in Weyl semimetals found Heisenberg, Ising-like, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) types of interactions. However, different range functions are obtained in the literature. In this work, we calculate the Weyl-mediated RKKY interaction by using the divergence-free imaginary-time formalism and obtain exact analytical results at finite temperature. The discrepancies among zero temperature range functions in the literature are resolved. At nonzero temperature, the interaction strength decays exponentially in the long distance limit. But in the short distance limit, the DM interaction shows a thermal enhancement, an effect persists up to higher temperature for shorter distance. This provides a mechanism stabilizing the helical order observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport and activation energy of the surface states in Cd3As2 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments performed the magnetotransport measurements in (001)-oriented Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films and attributed the magnetotransport properties to the surface states. In this paper, by using an effective model to describe the surface states, we analyze the Landau bands and then calculate the magnetoconductivities and magnetoresistivities. From these results, the features of two-dimensional quantum Hall effect of the surface states can be captured. More importantly, we reveal that the activation energy is determined by the Hall plateau width, which can explain the experimental observations that the activation energies at odd plateaus are larger than those at even plateaus. We also analyze the roles played by the structural inversion symmetry breaking and impurity scatterings in the magnetotransport, and suggest that their combined effects would lead to the absence of some Hall plateaus.</description>

      <title>Electron-transverse acoustic phonon couplings in three-dimensional pentatellurides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse acoustic (TA) phonon waves are analogous to electromagnetic waves and can carry a certain angular momentum. In this paper, we study the electron-TA phonon couplings in three-dimensional pentatellurides and explore the conditions under which the TA phonon condensation is stable. We analyze the Lindhard response function, phonon softening, mean-field parameters, and renormalized dispersions, on the basis of which the phase diagrams of the electron-phonon couplings in ZrTe$_5$ and HfTe$_5$ are calculated. The phase diagrams show that, if the chemical potential lies near the Weyl nodes, the TA phonon condensation will dominate and lead to the shear strain wave phase. We further reveal that when the wave vector of the particular phonon mode is smaller, the critical coupling strength will be weaker for the phonon condensation, which thus favors the condensation phase.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Resonant Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions for Simultaneous High Tunnel Electroresistance and Low Resistance-Area Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric tunnel junctions offer potential for non-volatile memory with low power, fast switching, and scalability, but their performance is limited by a high resistance-area product and a low tunnel electroresistance ratio. To address these challenges, we propose a doped HfO2-based, silicon-compatible asymmetric resonant ferroelectric tunnel junction design with a quantum well embedded between two ferroelectric layers, replacing the conventional metal-ferroelectric-metal structure. Using a self-consistent coupling of the non-equilibrium Green's function method with a Preisach-based model, we demonstrate that the quantum well enhances resonant tunneling effects, leading to a simultaneous reduction in the resistance-area product and a boost in the tunnel electroresistance ratio. The low-resistance state becomes more robust, while the high-resistance state is suppressed, improving readout speed and reducing power usage. We observed that incorporating a 2 nm quantum well significantly enhances the tunnel electroresistance ratio, achieving a peak value of approximately 6.15 x 10^4 percent, while simultaneously minimizing the resistance-area product to 47.1 Ohm-cm^2 at 0.175 V. Additionally, the device exhibits negative differential resistance, further enhancing its functionality. Our results confirm that this design enables scalable, energy-efficient, and high-performance non-volatile memory, making it a strong candidate for future memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Spin-Wave Propagation in Anisotropy-Graded Iron Films Prepared by Nitrogen Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradual modification of the magnetic properties in ferromagnetic films has recently been proposed as an effective method to channel and control spin waves for the development of new functionalities in magnonic devices. Here, we investigate graded FeN films prepared by low-dose nitrogen implantation of Fe epitaxial thin films. Combining Brillouin light scattering measurements and a spin-wave theoretical approach, we show that nitrogen implantation induces a graded profile of both the in-plane and the perpendicular anisotropies along the film thickness. This graduation leads to a significant modification of the spin-wave spatial localization and generates a marked frequency asymmetry in the spin-wave dispersion. Moreover, we find that the anisotropy profile, and as a consequence the dispersion relation, can be tuned on changing the implantation dose, opening a way for the potential use of the graded Fe-N films in magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Tunable Generalized Wigner Crystal and Fractional Chern Insulator in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the forming of low-energy flat bands, the moir\'e superlattices of the transition metal dichalcogenides are fascinating platforms for studying novel correlated states when such flat bands are fractionally filled, with the Coulomb interaction dominating. Here, we demonstrate that pressure can efficiently tune the flatness and quantum geometry of the single-particle bands in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($\textit{t}$MoTe$_2$). By fractionally filling the topmost valence band, we find that pressure can act as a flexible means to modulate the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and the generalized Wigner crystal (GWC) and control their many-body topological phase transitions. Moreover, our results indicate a remarkable correspondence between the single-particle band geometry and the formation of FCI and GWC. As the recent experiments report the presence of FCI phases in $\textit{t}$MoTe$_2$, our predictions could be readily implemented experimentally.</description>

      <title>Current response to axial gauge fields in noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electric current response to axial gauge fields in noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals. The absence of both time-reversal and inversion symmetries allows for new types of responses. We systematically calculate the transverse, longitudinal, and Hall responses to axial gauge potentials with both linear and quadratic dispersion relations. The transverse and Hall responses are of comparable magnitude, while the longitudinal response is much smaller. Notably, with increasing frequency, the transverse and Hall response functions manifest a peak whose height is determined by the properties of Weyl fermions and is independent of the axial gauge potential. The main features of the response functions survive in the presence of disorders. As applications of our results, we propose a Hall type magnetopiezoelectric effect, where a transverse sound wave can induce an electric current whose direction is perpendicular to the directions of sound propagation and polarization. Our results also provide a mechanism to excite magnons using electric fields and could be useful for magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Solving the Phase Problem of Diffraction: X-ray Standing Waves Imaging on Bismuthene/SiC(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase retrieval problem is a fundamental shortcoming of all diffraction-based methods, arising from the inability to measure the phase of scattered waves. The (normal incidence) X-ray standing wave (NIXSW) technique circumvents this issue by introducing a (Bragg-generated) X-ray standing wave field throughout the sample, relative to which any atomic species can be localized by probing its fluorescence or photoelectron yield. In essence, in a single measurement the complex scattering factor (i.e., its amplitude \textit{and} phase) corresponding to the used Bragg reflection is determined. Performing this for multiple Bragg reflections enables one to reconstruct the scattering density of the sample in three dimensions, straightforwardly as the Fourier sum of all measured (complex) scattering factors. Here, we utilize this technique to reveal the structural key features involved in the formation of the quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene on silicon carbide. In this prominent example, the two-dimensional Bi layer is confined between a 4H-SiC substrate crystal and an epitaxial graphene layer. The key finding is a change in the adsorption site of the Bi atoms underneath the graphene upon hydrogenation, caused by the H-saturation of one (out of three) Si dangling bonds per unit cell. This structural change, clearly revealed by our NIXSW imaging experiment, is the key feature leading to the formation of the characteristic band structure of the 2D bismuthene honeycomb.</description>

      <title>Measuring Casimir Force Across a Superconducting Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Casimir effect and superconductivity are foundational quantum phenomena whose interaction remains an open question in physics. How Casimir forces behave across a superconducting transition remains unresolved, owing to the experimental difficulty of achieving alignment, cryogenic environments, and isolating small changes from competing effects. This question carries implications for electron physics, quantum gravity, and high-temperature superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an on-chip superconducting platform that overcomes these challenges, achieving one of the most parallel Casimir configurations to date. Our microchip-based cavities achieve unprecedented area-to-separation ratio between plates, exceeding previous Casimir experiments by orders of magnitude and generating the strongest Casimir forces yet between compliant surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used for the first time to directly detect the resonant motion of a suspended membrane, with subatomic precision in both lateral positioning and displacement. Such precision measurements across a superconducting transition allow for the suppression of all van der Waals, electrostatic, and thermal effects. Preliminary measurements suggest superconductivity-dependent shifts in the Casimir force, motivating further investigation and comparison with theories. By uniting extreme parallelism, nanomechanics, and STM readout, our platform opens a new experimental frontier at the intersection of Casimir physics and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for an Anderson transition in a disordered system with non-reciprocal hopping to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges are localized at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which the charges are localized at random positions. In periodic boundary conditions, the skin effect gives way to a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If additional multipole moments like dipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable for any amount of disorder. As a result, under periodic boundary conditions, the system is always delocalized regardless of disorder strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an experimental approach to determine magneto-optical effects which combines x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) with x-ray interferometry, based on the concepts of Young's canonical double slit. By covering one of two slits with a magnetic thin film and employing XMCD, we show that it is possible to determine both the real and the imaginary parts of the complex refractive index by measuring the fringe shifts that occur due to a change in the sample magnetization. Our hybrid spectroscopic-interferometric methodology provides a means to probe changes in the magnetic refractive index in terms of the electron spin moment.</description>

      <title>Restoring the second law to classical-quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All physical theories should obey the second law of thermodynamics. However, existing proposals to describe the dynamics of hybrid classical-quantum systems either violate the second law or lack a proof of its existence. Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Heat operator approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the strong-coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems exchange heat with their environments and the fluctuations of this heat carry crucial signatures of the underlying dynamical processes. Within the well-established two-point measurement scheme and employing thermofield dynamics, we identify a 'heat operator,' whose moments with respect to the vacuum state correspond to the stochastic moments of the heat exchanged with a thermal bath. This recasts the computation of heat statistics as a standard unitary time-evolution problem, allowing us to leverage powerful tensor-network techniques for simulating quantum dynamics. In particular, we exploit the chain mapping of thermodynamic reservoirs to compute heat fluctuations in the Ohmic spin-boson model. The method, however, is general and applies to arbitrary open quantum systems coupled to non-interacting (bosonic or fermionic) thermal environments, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Induced magnetic moment at two-dimensional MXene/ferromagnetic interface evaluated by angle-dependent hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent ferromagnetism on the surface of recent two-dimensional (2D) MXene is investigated by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and angle-dependent hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). Focusing on the Cr2N as one of the 2D-MXenes, the bilayers of Cr2N/Co and Cr2N/Pt are prepared by magnetron sputtering technique. XMCD reveals the induced magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N/Co interface, while it is not observed in the Cr2N/Pt interface at room temperature. To distinguish the possible origins of either the interlayer magnetic exchange coupling or the charge transfer at the interfaces, the additional controlled Cr2N/Cu bilayer, whose work function of Cu is consistent with Co, is prepared. HAXPES spectra for the Cr 2p core level near the interface of Cr2N/Cu is consistent with that of Cr2N/Co, indicating that the induced magnetic moment of Cr observed by XMCD for the Cr2N/Co can be attributed to the interlayer magnetic exchange coupling, rather than the charge transfer, which is a specific characteristics emerged at the interface with 2D-MXene.</description>

      <title>Near-room-temperature zero-dimensional polariton lasers with sub-10 GHz linewidths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrow and brilliant spectral lines are essential assets for high-resolution spectroscopy as well as for precision sensing and optomechanics. In semiconductor structures and, in particular, in the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system, strong emission lines with nanosecond coherence times can be provided by the opto-electronic resonances of microcavity exciton-polariton condensates. The temporal coherence of these resonances, however, normally rapidly deteriorates as the temperature increases beyond a few tens of kelvins due to exciton dissociation. Here, we demonstrate that the temperature stability of polariton condensates in (Al,Ga)As can be significantly improved by confinement within micrometer-sized intracavity traps. We show that trapped condensates can survive up to ~200 K while maintaining a light-matter character with decoherence rates below 10 GHz (i.e., $&lt; 40 {\mu}$eV linewidths). These linewidths are by an order of magnitude smaller than those so far reported for other solid-state systems at these temperatures. Confinement thus provides a pathway towards room-temperature polariton condensation using the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system with prospects for application in scalable on-chip photonic devices for optical processing, sensing, and computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) are a class of aperiodic ordered structures that emerge in various systems, from metallic alloys to soft matter and driven non-equilibrium systems. Within a mesoscale theory based on slowly-varying complex amplitudes for QCs, we track dislocations as topological defects harbored by the amplitudes and characterize their Burgers vectors and induced deformations. We study the formation of dislocations at semicoherent interfaces, particularly those emerging from rotated inclusions, and find a hierarchy of dislocations forming at such interfaces. We further analyze interfaces in strained systems, revealing conditions for the emergence of periodic dislocation arrays and discussing the energetics of dislocations associated with different phonon and phason deformations. The stability, interaction, and motion of dislocation dipoles and quadrupoles are also discussed. These findings provide new insights into the mesoscale modeling of dislocations in QCs and their distinct behavior compared to conventional crystals, while demonstrating a versatile framework for studying dislocations in systems exhibiting quasicrystalline order.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Stokes Analysis of Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters play a vital role in advancing quantum technologies, particularly in quantum computation and communication, where single-photon polarization acts as a fundamental information carrier. Precise polarization characterization is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying polarization dynamics, which is critical for developing quantum emitters with minimized polarization-related errors. In this study, we employ the Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate (RQWP) method to comprehensively characterize the polarization state of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). By examining both time-averaged and dynamic polarization features, we demonstrate the time-resolved evolution of Stokes parameters from a solid-state single-photon emitter using the RQWP technique. This approach provides more complete polarization information than conventional micro-photoluminescence methods, without requiring modifications to the experimental setup. Our results uncover intricate polarization dynamics in hBN emitters, offering insights that were previously inaccessible. The techniques presented here can be broadly applied to polarization analysis of solid-state quantum emitters across various material platforms.</description>

Abstract: The combination of Maxwell and X-ray Bloch equations forms an appropriate framework to describe ultrafast time-resolved X-ray experiments on attosecond time scale in crystalline solids. However, broadband experiments such as X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy or resonant inelastic X-ray scattering require a detailed knowledge of the electronic structure and transition matrix elements. Here, we show how to fill this gap by combining the Maxwell-X-ray Bloch formalism with first-principles calculations treating explicitly the core states. The resulting X-ray absorption spectrum recovers key spectral signatures which were missing in our previous work relying on a semi-empirical tight-binding approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that the quantum geometry of electronic bands determines the electromagnetic properties of non-interacting insulators and semimetals. However, the role of quantum geometry in the optical responses of interacting electron systems remains largely unexplored. Here we examine the interplay between Coulomb interactions and Bloch-band quantum geometry in clean metals. We demonstrate that the low-frequency optical conductivity of a correlated metal encodes the structure of Bloch wave functions at the Fermi surface. This response originates from integrating out highly off-resonant interband scattering processes enabled by Coulomb interactions. The resulting quantum-geometric contribution appears generically in multiband systems, but becomes the dominant effect in the optical conductivity for a parabolic band. We consider a dilute correlated metal near a topological band inversion and show that the doping dependence of optical absorption can measure how the orbital character of Bloch wave functions changes at the Fermi surface. Our results illustrate how the confluence of quantum geometry and Coulomb interactions can enable optical processes and enrich the physics of Fermi liquids.</description>

Abstract: The parametric torque presents a promising recording mechanism for MRAM, complementing Spin Transfer Torque and Spin Orbit Torque, enabling magnetization reversal in a nanomagnet using a DC electrical current. Its resonance nature allows for optimization of magnetization reversal at a lower current, presenting an opportunity for a lower recording current and, therefore, for efficient and high-performance operation in modern MRAM technology. The in-plane magnetic field generated by spin accumulation serves as the driving force behind this torque. Experimental measurements of the current-induced in-plane magnetic field in the FeB nanomagnet reveal its magnitude to be around 40 Gauss at a current density of 25 mA/$\mu m^2$, a value adequate for facilitating parametric magnetization reversal. The parametric torque is analytically calculated by solving the Landau-Lifshitz equation. Analytical calculations demonstrate its potential in advancing modern MRAM technology.</description>

Abstract: Superconductor--semiconductor hybrid systems play a crucial role in realizing nanoscale quantum devices, including hybrid qubits, Majorana bound states, and Kitaev chains. For such hybrid devices, subgap states play a prominent role in their operation. In this work, we study such subgap states via Coulomb and tunneling spectroscopy through a superconducting island defined in a semiconductor nanowire fully coated by a superconductor. We systematically explore regimes ranging from an almost decoupled island to the open configuration. In the weak coupling regime, the experimental observations are very similar in the absence of a magnetic field and when one flux quantum is piercing the superconducting shell. Conversely, in the strong coupling regime, significant distinctions emerge between the two cases. We ascribe this different behavior to the existence of subgap states at one flux quantum, which become observable only for sufficiently strong coupling to the leads. We support our interpretation using a simple model to describe transport through the island. Our study highlights the importance of studying a broad range of tunnel couplings for understanding the rich physics of hybrid devices.</description>

Abstract: Recently, tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices (discretized AdS space) have gained significant attention, leading to hyperbolic band theory and non-Abelian Bloch states. In this paper, we investigate these quantum systems from the perspective of quantum information, focusing particularly on the scaling of entanglement entropy (EE) that has been regarded as a powerful quantum-information probe into exotic phases of matter. It is known that on $d$-dimensional translation-invariant Euclidean lattice, the EE of band insulators scales as an area law ($\sim L^{d-1}$; $L$ is the linear size of the boundary between two subsystems). Meanwhile, the EE of metals (with finite Density-of-State, i.e., DOS) scales as the renowned Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law ($\sim L^{d-1}\log L$). The appearance of logarithmic divergence, as well as the analytic form of the coefficient $c$ is mathematically controlled by the Widom conjecture of asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices and can be physically understood via the Swingle's argument. However, the hyperbolic lattice, which generalizes translational symmetry, results in inapplicability of these analytic approaches and the potential non-trivial behavior of EE. Here we make an initial attempt through numerical simulation. Remarkably, we find that both cases adhere to the area law, indicating the effect of background hyperbolic geometry that influences quantum entanglement. To achieve the results, we first apply the vertex inflation method to generate hyperbolic lattice on the Poincar\'{e} disk, and then apply the Haydock recursion method to compute DOS. Finally, we study the scaling of EE for different bipartitions via exact diagonalization and perform finite-size scaling. We also investigate how the coefficient of the area law is correlated to bulk gap in gapped case and to the DOS in gapless case respectively. Future directions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics. Experimental efforts to date have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials typically amorphous metals and semiconducting quantum Hall or quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems. However, the interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials where the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here, we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling $\nu=-1$ as well as a superconducting state at $\nu-3.5$ at zero magnetic field. Remarkably, gate voltage can also be used to actuate nonvolatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further reveal a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at $\nu=2/3$-also stable at zero magnetic field-enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket, while leaving the topology of the $\nu=-1$ quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low-disorder limit.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact formulas for the stripe domains period in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with out-of-plane anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically exact formulas for the equilibrium magnetic stripe period in ultrathin films with out-of-plane anisotropy that include the full domain wall magnetic dipolar energy. Starting with the reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model valid for thin films, we obtain the leading order approximation for the energy per unit volume in the vanishing film thickness limit in the case of Bloch and N\'eel wall rotations. Its minimization in the stripe period leads to an analytical expression for the equilibrium period with a prefactor proportional to the Bloch wall width. The constant in the prefactor, related to the long-range dipolar interactions, is carefully evaluated. This results in a remarkable agreement of the stripe domain energy density and stripe period predicted by our analytical formulas with micromagnetic simulations. Our formula can be used to accurately deduce magnetic parameters from the experimental measurements of the stripe period and to systematically predict the equilibrium stripe periods in ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nonlinear Hall effect by Cooper pairs near superconductor criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike the linear Hall effect that requires broken time-reversal symmetry, the nonlinear Hall effect may occur in time-reversal symmetric systems as long as there exists a non-zero Berry curvature dipole in the absence of inversion symmetry. Interestingly, the presence of time-reversal symmetry is consistent with and thus allows a direct transition into a superconducting phase. Indeed, superconductivity has been established in various nonlinear Hall materials, such as WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$, at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the nonlinear Hall response should be significantly enhanced near the superconducting criticality, dominated by the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contributions augmented by superconducting fluctuations, which we attribute to the Berry curvature dipole and a divergent lifetime $\tau\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$ of the Cooper pairs, instead of the single electrons. Such a controlled enhancement brings the nonlinear Hall effect into various simple experimental observations and practical applicational potentials.</description>

      <title>Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal ballistic transport in multi-layer Weyl semimetal films with surface engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl semimetal (WSM) thin films exhibit distinct electronic properties compared to their bulk counterparts. In this study, we theoretically investigate the nonreciprocal ballistic transport phenomena arising in WSM thin films due to surface modifications. Our analysis demonstrates that the nonreciprocity is sub-band-resolved, where the surface states provide the dominant contribution to the nonreciprocity, whereas the bulk states introduce a negative correction. Calculations further reveal a quantum size effect: overall, the nonreciprocal signal decreases with increasing film thickness, but it undergoes discontinuities as the Fermi energy approaches the bottom of a sub-band. Moreover, we observe that the density of states (DOS) in such multi-layer systems exhibits a thickness-independent pattern, which can be effectively explained by a single-variable theory.</description>

      <title>Backscattering in Topological Edge States Despite Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-momentum-locked edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) provide a compelling platform for spintronic applications, owing to their intrinsic protection against backscattering from non-magnetic disorder. This protection emerges from time-reversal symmetry, which pairs Kramers partners of helical edge modes with opposite spin and momentum, thereby strictly forbidding elastic single-particle backscattering within the pair. Yet, contrary to the idealized notion of linear edge bands, the non-monotonic dispersions of realistic materials can host multiple Kramers pairs, reintroducing backscattering channels between them without violating time-reversal symmetry. Here, we investigate inter-Kramers pair backscattering in the non-linear edge bands of the QSHI indenene, highlighting a critical aspect of edge-state stability. Using quasiparticle interference in scanning tunneling spectroscopy -- a direct probe of backscattering -- we observe pairwise coupling between energy-degenerate Kramers pairs, while energy regions with only a single Kramers pair remain strictly protected. Supported by theoretical analysis, our findings provide an unprecedented experimental demonstration of edge state backscattering fully consistent with their underlying topological protection. This insight has profound implications for numerous QSHI candidates, emphasizing that the mere presence of gap-traversing edge modes does not inherently guarantee their protection against backscattering.</description>

      <title>X-type stacking in cross-chain antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13271v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical phenomena in condensed matter normally arise from the collective effect of all atoms, while selectively addressing a lone atomic sublattice by external stimulus is elusive. The later functionality may, however, benefit various applications, as the response may differ when the external stimulus affects only a specific sublattice rather than the entire solid. Here, we introduce cross-chain antiferromagnets, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices forms a pattern of intersecting atomic chains, allowing for the sublattice selectivity. We dub this antiferromagnetic (AFM) stacking X-type and demonstrate that it exhibits unique spin-dependent transport properties not present in conventional magnets. Through high-throughput analyses and computations, we unveil three prototypes of X-type AFM stacking and identify 15 candidate candidates. Using $\beta$-Fe$_{2}$PO$_{5}$ as a representative X-type antiferromagnet, we predict sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport driven by the X-type stacking, where one magnetic sublattice conducts, while the other does not. Consequently, a spin torque can be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast dynamics of the N\`eel vector capable of deterministic switching of the AFM domains. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of magnetic moment stacking and reveals sublattice-selective physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Integration of Sub-50 nm III-V Nano-Heterostructures on Si (001) for Telecom Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. The integration of III-V materials has been proven essential to overcome this drawback. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nanoheterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirms the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium, and the correlation of the growth parameters with the nanoscale structure was analyzed using advanced electron microscopy. The eight-band k.p calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. Optical characterization shows that heterostructure emission can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lasers and nano-LEDs and quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of topological pairing orders characterized by a half-integer pair monopole charge, leading to Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry. This exotic spinor order emerges from pairing between Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by an odd integer. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate spinor superconducting orders with monopole charges $\pm 1/2$, featuring a single gap node and nontrivial surface states. Additionally, the superfluid velocity follows a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation in spatially inhomogeneous pairing orders. The concept extends to spinor density waves and excitons.</description>

      <title>Terahertz electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of the electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals induced by an intense single-cycle terahertz pulse. The effect reveals itself as a transient change of the polarization state of a femtosecond laser pulse reflected from the crystal that is exposed to the terahertz electric field. The corresponding experimental signal follows the field with a sub-100-fs delay and can be represented as a linear combination of the terahertz electric field and its square. The linear and quadratic components are of comparable magnitude. The latter is almost independent of crystal orientation, while the former demonstrates three-fold rotational symmetry in agreement with the trigonal symmetry of the crystal surface. The electro-optic effect vanishes upon phase transition to the non-topological metal state induced by indium doping and also can be quenched by a femtosecond pre-pulse. We associate this effect with surface Dirac electronic states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and discuss its possible mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional perovskites with maximum symmetry enable exciton diffusion length exceeding 2 micrometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing semiconductors with high symmetry of their crystallographic structures has been a virtue of inorganic materials and has resulted in novel physical behaviors. In contrast, hybrid (organic and inorganic) crystals such as two-dimensional metal halide perovskites exhibit much lower crystal symmetry due to in-plane or out of plane octahedral distortions. Despite their amazing ability for photoinduced light emission at room temperature, the Achilles' heel of this attractive class of 2D materials for optoelectronics remains the poor control and lack of performance for charge carrier transport. Inspired by the tremendous charge carrier properties of the 3D cubic perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and combining the use of the appropriate cage cation, the spacer molecule and the temperature and rate of crystallization, we report a new series of FA-based layered two-dimensional perovskites that exhibits the highest theoretically predicted symmetry with a tetragonal P4/mmm space group, resulting in no octahedral distortion in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These 2D perovskites present the shortest interlayer distances (4 angstrom), which results in systematically lower bandgaps (1.7 to 1.8 eV). Finally, the absence of octahedral distortions, results in an exciton diffusion length of 2.5 {\mu}m, and a diffusivity of 4.4 cm2s-1, both of which are an order of magnitude larger compared to previously reported 2D perovskites and on par with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>
