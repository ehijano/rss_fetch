      <title>Financial Fine-tuning a Large Time Series Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large models have shown unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, image generation, and most recently, time series forecasting. This leads us to ask the question: treating market prices as a time series, can large models be used to predict the market? In this paper, we answer this by evaluating the performance of the latest time series foundation model TimesFM on price prediction. We find that due to the irregular nature of price data, directly applying TimesFM gives unsatisfactory results and propose to fine-tune TimeFM on financial data for the task of price prediction. This is done by continual pre-training of the latest time series foundation model TimesFM on price data containing 100 million time points, spanning a range of financial instruments spanning hourly and daily granularities. The fine-tuned model demonstrates higher price prediction accuracy than the baseline model. We conduct mock trading for our model in various financial markets and show that it outperforms various benchmarks in terms of returns, sharpe ratio, max drawdown and trading cost.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity in Interbank Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted reciprocity between two agents can be defined as the minimum of sending and receiving value in their bilateral relationship. In financial networks, such reciprocity characterizes the importance of individual banks as both liquidity absorber and provider, a feature typically attributed to large, intermediating dealer banks. In this paper we develop an exponential random graph model that can account for reciprocal links of each node simultaneously on the topological as well as on the weighted level. We provide an exact expression for the normalizing constant and thus a closed-form solution for the graph probability distribution. Applying this statistical null model to Italian interbank data, we find that before the great financial crisis (i) banks displayed significantly more weighted reciprocity compared to what the lower-order network features (size and volume distributions) would predict (ii) with a disappearance of this deviation once the early periods of the crisis set in, (iii) a trend which can be attributed in particular to smaller banks (dis)engaging in bilateral high-value trading relationships. Moreover, we show that neglecting reciprocal links and weights can lead to spurious findings of triadic relationships. As the hierarchical structure in the network is found to be compatible with its transitive but not with its intransitive triadic sub-graphs, the interbank market seems to be well-characterized by a hierarchical core-periphery structure enhanced by non-hierarchical reciprocal trading relationships.</description>

      <title>Integrative Analysis of Financial Market Sentiment Using CNN and GRU for Risk Prediction and Alert Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents an in-depth examination of stock market sentiment through the integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), enabling precise risk alerts. The robust feature extraction capability of CNN is utilized to preprocess and analyze extensive network text data, identifying local features and patterns. The extracted feature sequences are then input into the GRU model to understand the progression of emotional states over time and their potential impact on future market sentiment and risk. This approach addresses the order dependence and long-term dependencies inherent in time series data, resulting in a detailed analysis of stock market sentiment and effective early warnings of future risks.</description>
