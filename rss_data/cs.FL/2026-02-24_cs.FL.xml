      <title>NILE: Formalizing Natural-Language Descriptions of Formal Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how natural-language descriptions of formal languages can be compared to their formal representations and how semantic differences can be explained. This is motivated from educational scenarios where learners describe a formal language (presented, e.g., by a finite state automaton, regular expression, pushdown automaton, context-free grammar or in set notation) in natural language, and an educational support system has to (1) judge whether the natural-language description accurately describes the formal language, and to (2) provide explanations why descriptions are not accurate.
  To address this question, we introduce a representation language for formal languages, Nile, which is designed so that Nile expressions can mirror the syntactic structure of natural-language descriptions of formal languages. Nile is sufficiently expressive to cover a broad variety of formal languages, including all regular languages and fragments of context-free languages typically used in educational contexts. Generating Nile expressions that are syntactically close to natural-language descriptions then allows to provide explanations for inaccuracies in the descriptions algorithmically.
  In experiments on an educational data set, we show that LLMs can translate natural-language descriptions into equivalent, syntactically close Nile expressions with high accuracy - allowing to algorithmically provide explanations for incorrect natural-language descriptions. Our experiments also show that while natural-language descriptions can also be translated into regular expressions (but not context-free grammars), the expressions are often not syntactically close and thus not suitable for providing explanations.</description>

      <title>Embedding arbitrary Boolean circuits into fungal automata with arbitrary update sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sandpile automata of Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld (Phys. Rev. Lett., 1987) are a simple model for the diffusion of particles in space. A fundamental problem related to the complexity of the model is predicting its evolution in the parallel setting. Despite decades of effort, a classification of this problem for two-dimensional sandpile automata remains outstanding. Fungal automata were recently proposed by Goles et al. (Phys. Lett. A, 2020) as a spin-off of the model in which diffusion occurs either in horizontal $(H)$ or vertical $(V)$ directions according to a so-called update scheme. Goles et al. proved that the prediction problem for this model with the update scheme $H^4V^4$ is $\textbf{P}$-complete. This result was subsequently improved by Modanese and Worsch (Algorithmica, 2024), who showed the problem is $\textbf{P}$-complete also for the simpler updatenscheme $HV$. In this work, we fill in the gaps and prove that the prediction problem is $\textbf{P}$-complete for any update scheme that contains both $H$ and $V$ at least once.</description>

      <title>Positional $\omega$-regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of two-player games over graphs, a language $L$ is called positional if, in all games using $L$ as winning objective, the protagonist can play optimally using positional strategies, that is, strategies that do not depend on the history of the play. In this work, we describe the class of parity automata recognising positional languages, providing a complete characterisation of positionality for $\omega$-regular languages. As corollaries, we establish decidability of positionality in polynomial time, finite-to-infinite and 1-to-2-players lifts, and show the closure under union of prefix-independent positional objectives, answering a conjecture by Kopczy\'nski in the $\omega$-regular case.</description>

      <title>Equality of cycle lengths in one- and two-dimensional $\sigma$ automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the game Lights Out is played according to an algorithm specifying the player's sequence of moves, it can be modeled using deterministic cellular automata. One such model reduces to the $\sigma$ automaton, which evolves according to the 2-dimensional analog of Rule 90. We consider how the cycle lengths of multi-dimensional $\sigma$ automata depend on their dimension. We find that the cycle lengths of 1-dimensional $\sigma$ automata and 2-dimensional $\sigma$ automata (of the same size) are equal, and we prove this by relating the eigenvalues and Jordan blocks of their respective adjacency matrices. We also discover that cycle lengths of higher-dimensional $\sigma$ automata are bounded (despite the number of lattice sites increasing with dimension) and eventually saturate the upper bound.</description>

      <title>Generalised M\"obius Categories and Convolution Kleene Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolution algebras on maps from structures such as monoids, groups or categories into semirings, rings or fields abound in mathematics and the sciences. Of special interest in computing are convolution algebras based on variants of Kleene algebras, which are additively idempotent semirings equipped with a Kleene star. Yet an obstacle to the construction of convolution Kleene algebras on a wide class of structures has so far been the definition of a suitable star. We show that a generalisation of M\"obius categories combined with a generalisation of a classical definition of a star for formal power series allow such a construction. We discuss several instances of this construction on generalised M\"obius categories: convolution Kleene algebras with tests, modal convolution Kleene algebras, concurrent convolution Kleene algebras and higher convolution Kleene algebras (e.g. on strict higher categories and higher relational monoids). These are relevant to the verification of weighted and probabilistic sequential and concurrent programs, using quantitative Hoare logics or predicate transformer algebras, as well as for algebraic reasoning in higher-dimensional rewriting. We also adapt the convolution Kleene algebra construction to Conway semirings, which is widely studied in the context of weighted automata. Finally, we compare the convolution Kleene algebra construction with a previous construction of convolution quantales and present concrete example structures in preparation for future applications.</description>
