      <title>Study of Wide-Field-of-View X-ray Observations of the Virgo Cluster Using the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA) is the pathfinder of the wide-field X-ray telescope used in the Einstein Probe mission. In this study, we present an image of the Virgo Cluster taken by LEIA in the 0.5-4.5 keV band with an exposure time of $\sim$17.3 ks in the central region. This extended emission is generally consistent with the results obtained by ROSAT. However, the field is affected by bright point sources due to the instrument's Point Spread Function (PSF) effect. Through fitting of the LEIA spectrum of the Virgo Cluster, we obtained a temperature of $2.1^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ keV, which is consistent with the XMM-Newton results ($\sim$2.3 keV). Above 1.6 keV, the spectrum is dominated by the X-ray background. In summary, this study validates LEIA's extended source imaging and spectral resolution capabilities for the first time.</description>

      <title>Lower-mass-gap Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of compact stellar remnants in the mass range $2-5\,M_{\odot}$ has long been debated. This so-called lower mass gap was initially suggested by the lack of low-mass X-ray binary observations with accretors in this mass range, but it has recently been called into question following newer observations, including a lower-mass-gap candidate with a millisecond pulsar companion in the dense globular cluster NGC~1851. Here we model NGC~1851 with a grid of similar dense star clusters utilizing the state-of-the-art Monte Carlo $N$-body code \texttt{CMC}, and we specifically study the formation of lower-mass-gap black holes. We demonstrate that both massive star evolution and dynamical interactions can contribute to forming lower-mass-gap black holes. In general, the collapse of massive remnants formed through mergers of neutron stars or massive white dwarfs produces the largest number of lower-mass-gap black holes among all formation channels. However, in more massive clusters, supernova core collapse can contribute comparable numbers. Our NGC~1851-like models can reproduce millisecond pulsar -- lower-mass-gap black hole binaries similar to the observed system. Additionally, the lower-mass-gap black holes can also become components of dynamically assembled binaries, and some will be in merging black hole--neutron star systems similar to the recently detected gravitational wave source GW230529. However, the corresponding merger rate is probably $\lesssim 1~{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Cataclysmic Variables in the Chandra Source Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are compact binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a Roche-lobe-filling companion star. In this study, we searched for new CVs in the Milky Way in the Chandra Source Catalog v2.0, cross-matched with Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). We identified new CV candidates by combining X-ray and optical data in a color-color diagram called the ``X-ray Main Sequence". We used two different cuts in this diagram to compile pure and optically variable samples of CV candidates. We undertook optical spectroscopic follow-up observations with the Keck and Palomar Observatories to confirm the nature of these sources. We assembled a sample of 25,887 Galactic X-ray sources and found 14 new CV candidates. Seven objects show X-ray and/or optical variability. All sources show X-ray luminosity in the $\rm 10^{29}-10^{32}$ $\rm erg\ s^{-1}$ range, and their X-ray spectra can be approximated by a power-law model with photon indices in the $\rm \Gamma \sim 1-3$ range or an optically thin thermal emission model in the $\rm kT \sim 1-70$ keV range. We spectroscopically confirmed four CVs, discovering two new polars, one low accretion rate polar and a WZ~Sge-like low accretion rate CV. X-ray and optical properties of the other 9 objects suggest that they are also CVs (likely magnetic or dwarf novae), and one other object could be an eclipsing binary, but revealing their true nature requires further observations. These results show that a joint X-ray and optical analysis can be a powerful tool for finding new CVs in large X-ray and optical catalogs. X-ray observations such as those by Chandra are particularly efficient at discovering magnetic and low accretion rate CVs, which could be missed by purely optical surveys.</description>

      <title>The extremes of AGN variability: outbursts, deep fades, changing looks, exceptional spectral states, and semi-periodicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extremes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) variability offer valuable new insights into the drivers and physics of AGN. We discuss some of the most extreme cases of AGN variability; the highest amplitudes, deep minima states, extreme spectral states, Seyfert-type changes, and semi-periodic signals, including new X-ray observations. The properties of changing-look (CL) AGN are briefly reviewed and a classification scheme is proposed which encompasses the variety of CL phenomena; distinguishing slow and fast events, repeat events, and frozen-look AGN which do not show any emission-line response. Long-term light curves that are densely covered over multiple years, along with follow-up spectroscopy, are utilized to gain insight into the underlying variability mechanisms including accretion disk and broad-line region physics. Remarkable differences are seen, for instance, in the optical spectral response to extreme outbursts, implying distinct intrinsic variability mechanisms. Furthermore, we discuss methods for distinguishing between CL AGN and CL look-alike events (tidal disruption events or supernovae in dense media). Finally, semi-periodic light curve variability is addressed and the latest multiwavelength (MWL) light curve of the binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidate OJ 287 from the MOMO project is presented. Recent results from that project have clearly established the need for new binary SMBH modelling matching the tight new constraints from observations, including the measurement of a low (primary) SMBH mass of ~10^8 Msun which also implies that OJ 287 is no longer in the regime of near-future pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of radio signatures from winds and jets: Modelling synchrotron emission and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are seen in numerous compact sources; however, it has remained unclear how to distinguish between the driving mechanisms, such as winds and jets. Therefore, our study aims to offer observational insights from simulations to aid in this distinction. Specifically, in this paper, we investigate the evolution of wide-angled, moderately relativistic, magnetized winds and analyze their non-thermal radio emission and polarization properties. We find that the evolution of winds varies depending on factors such as power, density, and opening angle, which in turn influence their observable characteristics. Additionally, different viewing angles can lead to varying observations. Furthermore, we note distinctions in the evolution of winds compared to jets, resulting in disparities in their observable features. Jets typically exhibit a thin spine and hotspot(s). Winds manifest broader spines or an "hourglass-shaped" bright emission in the cocoon, which are capped by bright arcs. Both display high polarization coinciding with the bright spine and hotspots/arcs, although these regions are relatively compact and localized in jets when compared to winds. We emphasize the importance of high resolution, as we demonstrate that emission features from both jets and winds can become indistinguishable at lower resolutions. The distribution of polarization is largely unaffected by resolution, though lower polarization becomes more noticeable when the resolution is decreased.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Spin of the Galactic Center Supermassive Black Hole with Two Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a key science project of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the discovery and timing observations of radio pulsars in the Galactic Center would provide high-precision measurements of the spacetime around the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), and initiate novel tests of general relativity. The spin of Sgr A* could be measured with a relative error of $\lesssim 1\%$ by timing one pulsar with timing precision that is achievable for the SKA. However, the real measurements depend on the discovery of a pulsar in a very compact orbit, $P_b\lesssim0.5\,{\rm yr}$. Here for the first time we propose and investigate the possibility of probing the spin of Sgr A* with two or more pulsars that are in orbits with larger orbital periods, $P_b\sim 2- 5\,{\rm yr}$, which represents a more realistic situation from population estimates. We develop a novel method for directly determining the spin of Sgr A* from the timing observables of two pulsars and it can be readily extended for combining more pulsars. With extensive mock data simulations, we show that combining a second pulsar improves the spin measurement by $2-3$ orders of magnitude in some situations, which is comparable to timing a pulsar in a very tight orbit.</description>

      <title>Anti-correlation between Flux and Photon Index of Hard X-ray Emission from The Crab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) event-mode data during Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) occurrences, we conducted spectral analysis for the Crab system. From 38 good observations, which spans over a period of 18 years from 2006 to 2023, we found that the Crab's X-ray flux does not only flicker, but also significantly anti-correlates to its spectral power-law photon index. Since emission contribution of the Crab pulsar in this energy range is small, this anti-correlation is mainly about the emission of the Crab nebula. We suggest that this anti-correlation is an observational supporting evidence for the long-standing notion that the nebula emission is due to synchrotron radiation of shocked pulsar winds in the nebula.</description>

      <title>A HD thermal irradiated wind from outer thin accretion disk in LLAGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidently, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei LLAGNs comprise of inner advective disk and outer geometrically thin disk. The wind is inevitable in LLAGNs, mainly interpreted indirect way, also the evidences are growing for the presence of wind in outer thin disk. We present a hydrodynamics HD model for wind from outer thin disk where the main driver is the inner disk irradiation (which is parameterized by a number $x$ in hydrostatic equilibrium equation with a slightly unbalancing role). The model works for a low intense irradiation or from a height $z_s$ in optically thin medium. We solve the model equations in cylindrical coordinate along the $z$-axis for a given radius $r$ with assuming a tiny vertical speed $v_z$ ($\ll c_s$ sound speed). The sonic point conditions assure an isobaric regime above the sonic height ($z^{max}$), in addition from the height $z_f (\ll z^{max}$) the radial pressure gradient also supports the fluid rotation, and both conjointly assure a wind ejection from the $z^{max}$ with fluid speed. The $z^{max}$ increases with $x$, and beyond a large $z^{max}$ (say $z^{max}_t$ corresponded to maximum $x$) there is no physical solution. We start the computation from outer radius $r_o^{thin}$ to inner $r_{in}^{thin}$ with Bondi mass accretion rate $\dot{M}_{Bondi}$, to explore the $r$ dependency of mass inflow rate $\dot{M}$ and wind properties. We constrain the model by fixing $\dot{M}$ at $r_{in}^{thin}$ from the observations of NGC 1097, and check the feasibility of model by comparing the energetics with observed bolometric luminosity. The wind is an equatorial with viewing angle $i&gt;85$degree, and capable to generate red-/blue-shifted lines, it would be a general characteristics for LLAGNs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmological neutrino-dominated accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) based on the results of our fallback core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. We find that the predicted SGWB is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the SGWB from NDAFs without disk outflows might be detected by next-generation space-based interferometers such as Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and Big Bang Observer (BBO). In the low-frequency regime $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ Hz, this background is comparable to that expected from standard inflationary models. Therefore, the SGWB from NDAFs may become a foreground for searches of the SGWB generated in the inflationary epoch. Combining the diffuse NDAF neutrino background and SGWB from NDAFs, one may constrain the properties of the CCSNe and NDAFs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Polarized X-Ray Emission from the Accreting Millisecond Pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of polarized X-ray emission from an accreting millisecond pulsar. During a 10-day-long coverage of the February 2024 outburst of SRGA J144459.2-604207, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) detected an average polarization degree of the 2-8 keV emission of 2.3% +/- 0.4% at an angle of 59{\deg} +/- 6{\deg} (East of North; uncertainties quoted at the 1${\sigma}$ confidence level). The polarized signal shows a significant energy dependence with a degree of 4.0% +/- 0.5% between 3 and 6 keV and &lt; 2% (90% c.l.) in the 2-3 keV range. We used NICER, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations to obtain an accurate pulse timing solution and perform a phase-resolved polarimetric analysis of IXPE data. We did not detect any significant variability of the Stokes parameters Q and U with the spin and the orbital phases. We used the relativistic rotating vector model to show that a moderately fan-beam emission from two point-like spots at a small magnetic obliquity ($\simeq$ 10{\deg}) is compatible with the observed pulse profile and polarization properties. IXPE also detected 52 type-I X-ray bursts, with a recurrence time $\Delta t_{rec}$ increasing from 2 to 8 h as a function of the observed count rate $C$ as as $\Delta t_{rec} \simeq C^{-0.8}$ We stacked the emission observed during all the bursts and obtained an upper limit on the polarization degree of 8.5% (90% c.l.).</description>

      <title>The large-scale anisotropy and flux (de-)magnification of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the Galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the arrival direction distribution of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with a new suite of models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), assuming sources follow the large-scale structure of the Universe. We find a significantly reduced dipole amplitude compared to previous GMF models, and trace the change to the accidental position of the peak of the extragalactic UHECR flux, which falls at the boundary of the strong flux de-magnification due to the GMF toward the central region of the Galaxy. This serendipitous sensitivity of UHECR anisotropies to the GMF model will be a powerful probe of the source distribution as well as Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields. Demagnification by the GMF also impacts visibility of some popular source candidates.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters on oscillation modes in hot Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that certain nuclear parameters are more dominant than others in governing global neutron star properties, such as its structure or oscillation mode characteristics. Although neutron stars can in general assumed to be cold, in astrophysical scenarios such as newly born neutron stars or remnants of binary neutron star mergers, finite temperature effects play a non-negligible role. In this work, we perform a consistent and systematic investigation of the role of nuclear parameters and thermal effects on neutron star properties and fluid oscillation modes within a full general relativistic scheme. We impose constraints on the parameter space of the relativistic mean field model using state-of-the-art information from terrestrial experiments and multi-messenger astrophysical data. We find effective nucleon mass to be the most important nuclear parameter controlling astrophysical observables of hot neutron stars, similar to the cold beta equilibrated matter. However, we conclude that the interplay among saturation properties and astrophysical observables depends not only on the thermal configurations considered but also on the constraints imposed. We also investigated the role of nuclear saturation parameters on some universal relations for hot NSs which are important in gravitational wave asteroseismology. Our investigation confirmed that these relations are mostly insensitive to nuclear saturation properties and mainly affected by variation of charge fraction in the star.</description>

      <title>North Polar Spur: gaseous plume(s) from star-forming regions at $\sim$3-5 kpc from Galactic Center?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the North Polar Spur (NPS) and many less prominent structures are formed by gaseous metal-rich plumes associated with star-forming regions (SFRs). The SFRs located at the tangent to the 3-5 kpc rings might be particularly relevant to NPS. A multi-temperature mixture of gaseous components and cosmic rays rises above the Galactic disk under the action of their initial momentum and buoyancy. Eventually, the plume velocity becomes equal to that of the ambient gas, which rotates with different angular speed than the stars in the disk. As a result, the plumes acquire characteristic bent shapes. An ad hoc model of plumes' trajectories shows an interesting resemblance to the morphology of structures seen in the radio continuum and X-rays.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Arrested Circumbinary Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems with comparable masses and a surrounding accretion disk can accrete gas through spiral accretion streams penetrating the central cavity formed by tidal interactions. Using three-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we investigate the possibility of a magnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity. Rather than solely continuously feeding the binary through spiral accretion streams, the accretion is regulated by the strong magnetic field inside the cavity. Transport of mass and angular momentum onto the binary then proceeds largely periodically in magnetic flux eruption episodes. The ejected flux tubes carry angular momentum outwards and away from the binary, inject hot plasma into the disk and can launch flares. This likely intermittent scenario could have potential implications for the emission signatures of supermassive black hole binaries, and potentially shed light onto the role magnetic fields play in the binary's orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>Shocking and Mass Loss of Compact Donor Stars in Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion. Following the explosion, the surviving donor star leaves at roughly its orbital velocity. The discovery of the runaway helium subdwarf star US 708, and seven hypervelocity stars from Gaia data, all with spatial velocities $\gtrsim 900$ km/s, strongly support a scenario in which the donor is a low-mass helium star, or a white dwarf. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the $\texttt{Athena++}$ code modeling the hydrodynamical interaction between a helium star or helium white dwarf, and the supernova ejecta. We find that $\approx 0.01-0.02\,M_{\odot}$ of donor material is stripped, and explain the location of the stripped material within the expanding supernova ejecta. We continue the post-explosion evolution of the shocked donor stars with the $\texttt{MESA}$ code. As a result of entropy deposition, they remain luminous and expanded for $\approx 10^{5}-10^{6}$ yrs. We show that the post-explosion properties of our helium white dwarf donor agree reasonably with one of the best-studied hypervelocity stars, D6-2.</description>

      <title>Flare Accelerated Electrons in Kappa-Distribution from X-Ray Spectra with Warm-Target Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray observations provide essential and valuable insights into the acceleration and propagation of non-thermal electrons during solar flares. Improved X-ray spectral analysis requires a deeper understanding of the dynamics of energetic electrons. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of accelerated electrons of a few thermal speeds are more complex. To better describe the energetic electrons after injection, a model considering energy diffusion and thermalization effects in flare conditions (warm-target model) has recently been developed for Hard X-ray spectral analysis. This model has demonstrated how the low-energy cut-off, which can hardly be constrained in cold-target modeling, can be determined. However, the power-law form may not be the most suitable representation of injected electrons. The kappa distribution, which is proposed as a physical consequence of electron acceleration, has shown successful application in RHESSI spectral analysis. In this study, we employ the kappa-form injected electrons in the warm-target model to analyze two M-class flares, observed by RHESSI and STIX, respectively. The best-fit results show that the kappa-form energetic electron spectrum generates lower non-thermal energy when producing a similar photon spectrum in the fit range compared to the power-law form. We also demonstrated that the fit parameters associated with kappa-form electron spectrum can be well determined with small fit uncertainty. Further, the kappa distribution, which covers the entire electron energy range, enables the determination of key electron properties such as total electron number density and average energy in the flare site, providing valuable information on electron acceleration processes.</description>

      <title>Spinning waveforms in cubic effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive analytic all-order-in-spin expressions for the leading-order time-domain waveforms generated in the scattering of two Kerr black holes with arbitrary masses and spin vectors in the presence of all independent cubic deformations of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. These are the two parity-even interactions $I_1$ and $G_3$, and the parity-odd ones $\tilde{I}_1$ and $\tilde{G}_3$. Our results are obtained using three independent methods: a particularly efficient direct integration and tensor reduction approach; integration by parts combined with the method of differential equations; and finally a residue computation. For the case of the $G_3$ and $\tilde{G}_3$ deformations we can express the spinning waveform in terms of the scalar waveform with appropriately shifted impact parameters, which are reminiscent of Newman-Janis shifts. For $I_1$ and $\tilde{I}_1$ similar shifts occur, but are accompanied by additional contributions that cannot be captured by simply shifting the scalar $I_1$ and $\tilde{I}_1$ waveforms. We also show the absence of leading-order corrections to gravitational memory. Our analytic results are notably compact, and we compare the effectiveness of the three methods used to obtain them. We also briefly comment on the magnitude of the corrections to observables due to cubic deformations.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Collapse From Accretion: a Probe of Massive Dark Matter Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the multi-scatter capturing of the massive dark matter (DM) particle inside the neutron star via a momentum-dependent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section. We find that the capturing enhanced for the positive velocity and momentum transfer dependent DM-nucleon scattering in comparison with the constant cross-section case. Further, a large capture of the DM particles can be thermalized and lead to black hole formation and, therefore, destroy the neutron star. Using the observation of the old neutron star in the DM-dominated region, we obtain strong constraints on massive DM parameters.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos and gamma rays from winds and tori in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02097v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Powerful winds with wide opening angles, likely driven by accretion disks around black holes (BHs), are observed in the majority of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and can play a crucial role in AGN and galaxy evolution. If protons are accelerated in the wind near the BH via diffusive shock acceleration, $pp$ and $p\gamma$ processes generate neutrinos as well as pair cascade emission from the gamma-ray to radio bands. The TeV neutrinos detected by IceCube from the obscured Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 may arise from collisionless shocks in a failed, line-driven wind that is physically well motivated. Although the cascade emission is $\gamma\gamma$-attenuated above a few MeV, it can still contribute significantly to the sub-GeV gamma rays and the sub-millimeter emission observed from NGC 1068. At higher energies, gamma rays can occur via $pp$ processes from a shock where an outgoing wind impacts the obscuring torus, along with some observable GHz-band emission. Tests and implications of this model are discussed. Neutrinos and gamma rays may offer unique probes of AGN wind launching sites, particularly for objects obscured in other forms of radiation.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Stellar-Collapse and Hierarchical-Merger origins of the Coalescing Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin and mass properties provide essential clues in distinguishing the origins of coalescing black holes (BHs). With a dedicated semiparametric population model for the coalescing binary black holes (BBHs), we identify two distinct categories of BHs among the GWTC-3 events, which is {favored over the one population scenario by} a logarithmic Bayes factor ($\ln\mathcal{B}$) of 7.5. One category, with a mass ranging from $\sim 25M_\odot$ to $\sim 80M_\odot$, is distinguished by the high spin magnitudes ($\sim0.75$) and consistent with the hierarchical merger origin. The other category, characterized by low spins, has a sharp mass cutoff at $\sim 40M_\odot$, which is natural for the stellar-collapse origin and in particular the pair-instability explosion of massive stars. We infer the local hierarchical merger rate density as $0.46^{+0.61}_{-0.24}~{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. Additionally, we find that a fraction of the BBHs has a cosine-spin-tilt-angle distribution concentrated preferentially around $1$, and the fully isotropic distribution for spin orientation is disfavored by a $\ln\mathcal{B}$ of -6.3, suggesting that the isolated field evolution channels are contributing to the total population.</description>

      <title>Light-Curve Structure and Halpha Line Formation in the Tidal Disruption Event AT 2019azh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AT 2019azh is a H+He tidal disruption event (TDE) with one of the most extensive ultraviolet and optical data sets available to date. We present our photometric and spectroscopic observations of this event starting several weeks before and out to approximately two years after the g-band peak brightness and combine them with public photometric data. This extensive data set robustly reveals a change in the light-curve slope and a possible bump in the rising light curve of a TDE for the first time, which may indicate more than one dominant emission mechanism contributing to the pre-peak light curve. Indeed, we find that the MOSFiT-derived parameters of AT 2019azh, which assume reprocessed accretion as the sole source of emission, are not entirely self-consistent. We further confirm the relation seen in previous TDEs whereby the redder emission peaks later than the bluer emission. The post-peak bolometric light curve of AT 2019azh is better described by an exponential decline than by the canonical t^{-5/3} (and in fact any) power-law decline. We find a possible mid-infrared excess around the peak optical luminosity, but cannot determine its origin. In addition, we provide the earliest measurements of the Halpha emission-line evolution and find no significant time delay between the peak of the V-band light curve and that of the Halpha luminosity. These results can be used to constrain future models of TDE line formation and emission mechanisms in general. More pre-peak 1-2 days cadence observations of TDEs are required to determine whether the characteristics observed here are common among TDEs. More importantly, detailed emission models are needed to fully exploit such observations for understanding the emission physics of TDEs.</description>

      <title>A three-parameter characterization of neutron stars' mass-radius relation and equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous models of neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) exist based on different superdense-matter physics approaches. Nevertheless, some NS properties show universal (EoS-independent) relations. Here, we propose a novel class of such universalities. Despite different physics inputs, a wide class of realistic nucleonic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models can be accurately described using only three parameters. For a given EoS, these are the mass and radius of the maximum-mass NS (or pressure and density in its center) and the radius of a half-maximum-mass star. With such a parametrization, we build universal analytic expressions for mass-radius and pressure-density relations. They form a semi-analytic mapping from the mass-radius relation to the EoS in NS cores (the so-called inverse Oppenheimer-Volkoff mapping). This mapping simplifies the process of inferring the EoS from observations of NS masses and radii. Applying it to current NS observations we set new limits on the high-density end of the EoS.</description>

      <title>Extended Shock Breakout and Early Circumstellar Interaction in SN 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a Type II SN with flash spectroscopy features which exploded in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 at $\sim$7 Mpc. The light-curve evolution over the first 30 hours can be fit by two power law indices with a break after 22 hours, rising from $M_V \approx -12.95$ mag at +0.66 days to $M_V \approx -17.91$ mag after 7 days. In addition, the densely sampled color curve shows a strong blueward evolution over the first few days and then behaves as a normal SN II with a redward evolution as the ejecta cool. Such deviations could be due to interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Early high- and low-resolution spectra clearly show high-ionization flash features from the first spectrum to +3.42 days after the explosion. From the high-resolution spectra, we calculate the CSM velocity to be 37 $\pm~4~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} $. We also see the line strength evolve rapidly from 1.22 to 1.49 days in the earliest high-resolution spectra. Comparison of the low-resolution spectra with CMFGEN models suggests that the pre-explosion mass-loss rate of SN 2024ggi falls in a range of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is similar to that derived for SN 2023ixf. However, the rapid temporal evolution of the narrow lines in the spectra of SN 2024ggi ($R_\mathrm{CSM} \sim 2.7 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{cm}$) could indicate a smaller spatial extent of the CSM than in SN 2023ixf ($R_\mathrm{CSM} \sim 5.4 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{cm}$) which in turn implies lower total CSM mass for SN 2024ggi.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation in Gravitationally-Unstable Collapsar Disks and Sub-Solar Neutron Star Mergers</title>

Abstract: Although stable neutron stars (NS) can in principle exist down to masses Mns ~ 0.1Msun, standard models of stellar core-collapse predict a robust lower limit Mns &gt;~ 1.2Msun, roughly commensurate with the Chandrasekhar mass Mch of the progenitor's iron core (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.5). However, this limit may be circumvented in sufficiently dense neutron-rich environments (Ye &lt;&lt; 0.5) for which Mch ~ Ye^2 is reduced to &lt; Msun. Such physical conditions could arise in the black hole accretion disks formed from the collapse of rapidly-rotating stars ("collapsars"), as a result of gravitational instabilities and cooling-induced fragmentation, similar to models for planet formation in protostellar disks. We confirm that the conditions to form sub-solar mass NS (ssNS) may be marginally satisfied in the outer regions of massive neutrino-cooled collapsar disks. If the disk fragments into multiple ssNS, their subsequent coalescence offers a channel for precipitating sub-solar mass LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave mergers that does not implicate primordial black holes. The model makes several additional predictions: (1) ~Hz frequency Doppler modulation of the ssNS-merger gravitational wave signals due to the binary's orbital motion in the disk; (2) at least one additional gravitational wave event (coincident within &lt;~ hours), from the coalescence of the ssNS-merger remnant(s) with the central black hole; (3) an associated gamma-ray burst and supernova counterpart, the latter boosted in energy and enriched with r-process elements from the NS merger(s) embedded within the exploding stellar envelope ("kilonovae inside a supernova").</description>

      <title>Constraining pseudo-Diracness with astrophysical neutrino flavors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three Standard Model neutrinos can have Majorana mass or strictly Dirac mass, but both scenarios are practically indistinguishable in neutrino oscillation experiments. If they are pseudo-Dirac, however, there will be new mass splittings among the pseudo-Dirac pairs, potentially leaving traces in neutrino oscillation phenomena. In this work, we use flavor ratios of astrophysical neutrinos to discriminate different possible mass spectra of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos. We show that it will be possible to impose robust bounds of order $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-12}$ $\text{eV}^2$ on the new mass squared splitting involving the third pseudo-Dirac mass eigenstates (those with the least electron flavor composition) with the future experiment IceCube-Gen2. The derived sensitivity is robust because it only assumes an extragalactic origin for the astrophysical neutrinos and hierarchical pseudo-Dirac mass spectrum. In case the neutrino sources are known in the future, such bounds can potentially improve by up to five orders of magnitude, reaching $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-17}$ $\text{eV}^2$.</description>
