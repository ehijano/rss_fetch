      <title>Two classes of Willmore Surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish two classification theorems for Willmore surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^2$. Firstly, we prove that a Willmore surface which is also minimal must be either a special complex curve given by a slice or a diagonal; or, a minimal surface in a totally geodesic submanifold $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ described by a solution of the sinh-Gordon equation in one variable. Secondly, we demonstrate that a Willmore surface is of product type if and only if it is the product of an elastic curve in $\mathbb{S}^2$ and a great circle.</description>

Abstract: We study the structure of Busemann spaces with measures satisfying the measure contraction property (MCP).

      <title>Computing Diffusion Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculus and geometry are ubiquitous in the theoretical modelling of scientific phenomena, but have historically been very challenging to apply directly to real data as statistics. Diffusion geometry is a new theory that reformulates classical calculus and geometry in terms of a diffusion process, allowing these theories to generalise beyond manifolds and be computed from data. This work introduces a new computational framework for diffusion geometry that substantially broadens its practical scope and improves its precision, robustness to noise, and computational complexity. We present a range of new computational methods, including all the standard objects from vector calculus and Riemannian geometry, and apply them to solve spatial PDEs and vector field flows, find geodesic (intrinsic) distances, curvature, and several new topological tools like de Rham cohomology, circular coordinates, and Morse theory. These methods are data-driven, scalable, and can exploit highly optimised numerical tools for linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Transverse expansion of the metric at null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the conformal Einstein equations to all orders at null infinity without imposing any restriction on the spacetime dimension, the topology of $\mathscr{I}$, or fall-off conditions for the Weyl tensor. In particular, we study how the equations constrain the geometry of null infinity when it is assumed to be foliated by cross-sections, not necessarily spheres. Our approach is coordinate-free and treats the conformal factor $\Omega$ as a dynamical variable. After identifying the free data at $\mathscr{I}$, we show that any two asymptotically flat spacetimes sharing the same free data at null infinity are necessarily isometric to infinite order. In addition, we provide a detached definition of null infinity and prove an existence theorem for asymptotically flat spacetimes solving the field equations to infinite order at $\mathscr{I}$ realizing the prescribed initial data.</description>

      <title>Rigidity Theorems for Asymptotically Euclidean $Q$-singular Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove some rigidity theorems associated to $Q$-curvature analysis on asymptotically Euclidean (AE) manifolds, which are inspired by the analysis of conservation principles within fourth order gravitational theories. A central object in this analysis is a notion of fourth order energy, previously analysed by the authors, which is subject to a positive energy theorem. We show that this energy can be more geometrically rewritten in terms of a fourth order analogue to the Ricci tensor, which we denote by $J_g$. This allows us to prove that Yamabe positive $J$-flat AE manifolds must be isometric to Euclidean space. As a by product, we prove that this $J$-tensor provides a geometric control for the optimal decay rates at infinity. This last result reinforces the analogy of $J$ as a fourth order analogue to the Ricci tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smooth axially symmetric Helfrich topological spheres are either round or else they must satisfy a second order equation known as the reduced membrane equation [17]. In this paper, we show that, conversely, axially symmetric closed genus zero solutions of the reduced membrane equation which, in addition, satisfy a rescaling condition are axially symmetric Helfrich spheres. We also exploit this characterization to geometrically describe these surfaces and present convincing evidence that they are symmetric with respect to a suitable plane orthogonal to the axis of rotation and that they belong to a particular infinite discrete family of surfaces.</description>

      <title>GEORCE: A Fast New Control Algorithm for Computing Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing geodesics for Riemannian manifolds is a difficult task that often relies on numerical approximations. However, these approximations tend to be either numerically unstable, have slow convergence, or scale poorly with manifold dimension and number of grid points. We introduce a new algorithm called GEORCE that computes geodesics in a local chart via a transformation into a discrete control problem. We show that GEORCE has global convergence and quadratic local convergence. In addition, we show that it extends to Finsler manifolds. For both Finslerian and Riemannian manifolds, we thoroughly benchmark GEORCE against several alternative optimization algorithms and show empirically that it has a much faster and more accurate performance for a variety of manifolds, including key manifolds from information theory and manifolds that are learned using generative models.</description>

      <title>Hodge theoretic results for nearly K\"ahler manifolds in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize to nearly K\"ahler manifolds of arbitrary dimensions most of the Hodge-theoretic results for nearly K\"ahler $6$-manifolds that were established by Verbitsky. In particular, for a compact nearly K\"ahler manifold of any dimension, the (appropriately defined) Hodge numbers are related to the Betti numbers in the same way as on a compact K\"ahler manifold. In the $6$-dimensional case, Verbitsky was able to say slightly more using the induced $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ structure. We discuss potential extensions of this to twistor spaces over positive scalar curvature quaternionic-K\"ahler manifolds, which are a particular class of $(4n+2)$-dimensional nearly K\"ahler manifolds equipped with a special $\mathrm{SU}(n) \! \cdot \! \mathrm{U}(1)$ structure.</description>

      <title>Overdetermined Steklov eigenvalue problems on compact surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the overdetermined problem given by
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta u=0 \text{ in } \Omega,\quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu} =\sigma_1 u \text{ on } \partial \Omega, \quad |\nabla u|=\text{constant on } \partial \Omega,
  \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a connected compact Riemannian surface with smooth boundary $\partial \Omega$, and $\sigma_1$ is the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of $\Omega$. We prove that this overdetermined problem admits a nontrivial solution if and only if $\Omega$ is $\sigma$-homothetic to either the flat unit disk or a flat cylinder $[-T,T]\times S^1$ for some $T\ge T_1$. This gives a complete answer to the question raised by Payne and Philippin in [Z.~Angew.~Math.~Phys. \textbf{42}(6), 864--873, 1991] for $\sigma=\sigma_1$ and arbitrary surfaces. In particular, we completely characterize compact domains in 2-dimensional space forms for which the overdetermined problem is solvable.</description>

      <title>Upper bound for the total mean curvature of spin fill-ins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gromov conjectured that the total mean curvature of the boundary of a compact Riemannian manifold can be estimated from above by a constant depending only on the boundary metric and on a lower bound for the scalar curvature of the fill-in. We prove Gromov's conjecture if the manifolds are spin with a constant that also depends on a lower bound on the mean curvature $H$ (which is allowed to take negative values).If the boundary is a (not necessarily convex) hypersurface in a space form of non-negative curvature, then the constant can be made explicit in terms of the mean curvature of this model embedding.If the boundary has constant sectional curvature $\kappa&gt;0$ and is a projective space of dimension $n\equiv 3 \mod 4$ or a sphere, then the constant can be expressed in terms of $\kappa$. If the boundary is a flat torus, then the constant can be expressed in terms of lattice data.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of harmonic map heat flows into $CAT(0)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1964, Eells and Sampson proved the celebrated long-time existence and convergence for the harmonic map heat flow into non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds. In 1992, Gromov and Schoen initiated the study of harmonic maps into $CAT(0) $ metric spaces. It naturally motivates the study of the harmonic map heat flow into singular metric spaces.
  In the 1990s, Mayer and Jost independently studied convex functionals on $CAT(0)$ spaces and extended Crandall-Liggett's theory of gradient flows from Banach spaces to $CAT(0) $ spaces to obtain the weak solutions for the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces. The weak solutions enjoy the favorable long-time existence, uniqueness and well-established long-time behaviors. It is a long-standing open question to ask if the weak solutions possess the Lipschitz regularity. Very recently, by using elliptic approximation method, Lin, Segatti, Sire, and Wang proved the weak solutions are Lipschitz in space and $1\over 2$-H\"older continuous in time, for a wide class of $CAT(0)$ spaces.
  In the present paper, we give a complete answer to the question. We show that every weak solution of the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces is Lipschitz continuous in both space and time. We also establish an Eells-Sampson-type Bochner inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.08178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refining Yau's and Kolodziej's techniques, we establish very precise uniform a priori estimates for degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations on compact K\"ahler manifolds, that allow us to control the blow up of the solutions as the cohomology class and the complex structure both vary. We apply these estimates to the study of various families of possibly singular K\"ahler varieties endowed with twisted K\"ahler-Einstein metrics, by analyzing the behavior of canonical densities, establishing uniform integrability properties, and developing the first steps of a pluripotential theory in families. This provides interesting information on the moduli space of stable varieties, extending works by Berman-Guenancia and Song, as well as on the behavior of singular Ricci flat metrics on (log) Calabi-Yau varieties, generalizing works by Rong-Ruan-Zhang, Gross-Tosatti-Zhang, Collins-Tosatti and Tosatti-Weinkove-Yang.</description>

      <title>Representation Geometry as a Diagnostic for Out-of-Distribution Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.</description>
