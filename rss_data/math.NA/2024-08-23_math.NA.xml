      <title>Auto-Stabilized Weak Galerkin Finite Element Methods on Polytopal Meshes without Convexity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an auto-stabilized weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method with a built-in stabilizer for Poisson equations. By utilizing bubble functions as a key analytical tool, our method extends to both convex and non-convex elements in finite element partitions, marking a significant advancement over existing stabilizer-free WG methods. It overcomes the restrictive conditions of previous approaches and is applicable in any dimension $d$, offering substantial advantages. The proposed method maintains a simple, symmetric, and positive definite structure. These benefits are evidenced by optimal order error estimates in both discrete $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms, highlighting the effectiveness and accuracy of our WG method for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Multipreconditioning with directional sweeping methods for high-frequency Helmholtz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the use of multipreconditioning, which allows for multiple preconditioners to be applied in parallel, on high-frequency Helmholtz problems. Typical applications present challenging sparse linear systems which are complex non-Hermitian and, due to the pollution effect, either very large or else still large but under-resolved in terms of the physics. These factors make finding general purpose, efficient and scalable solvers difficult and no one approach has become the clear method of choice. In this work we take inspiration from domain decomposition strategies known as sweeping methods, which have gained notable interest for their ability to yield nearly-linear asymptotic complexity and which can also be favourable for high-frequency problems. While successful approaches exist, such as those based on higher-order interface conditions, perfectly matched layers (PMLs), or complex tracking of wave fronts, they can often be quite involved or tedious to implement. We investigate here the use of simple sweeping techniques applied in different directions which can then be incorporated in parallel into a multipreconditioned GMRES strategy. Preliminary numerical results on a two-dimensional benchmark problem will demonstrate the potential of this approach.</description>

      <title>A nonstandard numerical scheme for a novel SECIR integro-differential equation-based model allowing nonexponentially distributed stay times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are a popular tool to model the spread of infectious diseases, yet they implicitly assume an exponential distribution to describe the flow from one infection state to another. However, scientific experience yields more plausible distributions where the likelihood of disease progression or recovery changes accordingly with the duration spent in a particular state of the disease. Furthermore, transmission dynamics depend heavily on the infectiousness of individuals. The corresponding nonlinear variation with the time individuals have already spent in an infectious state requires more realistic models. The previously mentioned items are particularly crucial when modeling dynamics at change points such as the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions. In order to capture these aspects and to enhance the accuracy of simulations, integro-differential equations (IDE) can be used.
  In this paper, we propose a generalized model based on integro-differential equations with eight infection states. The model allows for variable stay time distributions and generalizes the concept of ODE-based models as well as IDE-based age-of-infection models. In this, we include particular infection states for severe and critical cases to allow for surveillance of the clinical sector, avoiding bottlenecks and overloads in critical epidemic situations.
  We will extend a recently introduced nonstandard numerical scheme to solve a simpler IDE-based model. This scheme is adapted to our more advanced model and we prove important mathematical and biological properties for the numerical solution. Furthermore, we validate our approach numerically by demonstrating the convergence rate. Eventually, we also show that our novel model is intrinsically capable of better assessing disease dynamics upon the introduction of nonpharmaceutical interventions.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of higher order finite element methods for nonlinear magnetostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of electric machines and power transformers typically involves systems of nonlinear magnetostatics or -quasistatics, and their efficient and accurate simulation is required for the reliable design, control, and optimization of such devices. We study the numerical solution of the vector potential formulation of nonlinear magnetostatics by means of higher-order finite element methods. Numerical quadrature is used for the efficient handling of the nonlinearities and domain mappings are employed for the consideration of curved boundaries. The existence of a unique solution is proven on the continuous and discrete level and a full convergence analysis of the resulting finite element schemes is presented indicating order optimal convergence rates under appropriate smoothness assumptions. For the solution of the nonlinear discretized problems, we consider a Newton method with line search for which we establish global linear convergence with convergence rates that are independent of the discretization parameters. We further prove local quadratic convergence in a mesh-dependent neighborhood of the solution which becomes effective when high accuracy of the nonlinear solver is demanded. The assumptions required for our analysis cover inhomogeneous, nonlinear, and anisotropic materials, which may arise in typical applications, including the presence of permanent magnets. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical tests for some typical benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Non-overlapping Schwarz methods in time for parabolic optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here the classical Schwarz method with a time domain decomposition applied to unconstrained parabolic optimal control problems. Unlike Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann algorithms, we find different properties based on the forward-backward structure of the optimality system. Variants can be found using only Dirichlet and Neumann transmission conditions. Some of these variants are only good smoothers, while others could lead to efficient solvers.</description>

      <title>Convergence Properties of Iteratively Coupled Surface-Subsurface Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-subsurface flow models for hydrological applications solve a coupled multiphysics problem. This usually consists of some form of the Richards and shallow water equations. A typical setup couples these two nonlinear partial differential equations in a partitioned approach via boundary conditions. Full interaction between the subsolvers is ensured by an iterative coupling procedure. This can be accelerated using relaxation.
  In this paper, we apply continuous and fully discrete linear analysis techniques to study an idealized, linear, 1D-0D version of a surface-subsurface model. These result in explicit expressions for the convergence factor and an optimal relaxation parameter, depending on material and discretization parameters. We test our analysis results numerically for fully nonlinear 2D-1D experiments based on existing benchmark problems. The linear analysis can explain fast convergence of iterations observed in practice for different materials and test cases, even though we are not able to capture various nonlinear effects.</description>

      <title>Global optimization for data assimilation in landslide tsunamis models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to make automatic data assimilation for a landslide tsunami model, given by the coupling between a non-hydrostatic multi-layer shallow-water and a Savage-Hutter granular landslide model for submarine avalanches. The coupled model is discretized using a positivity-preserving second-order path-conservative finite volume scheme. The data assimilation problem is posed in a global optimization framework and we develop and compare parallel metaheuristic stochastic global optimization algorithms, more precisely multi-path versions of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, with hybrid global optimization algorithms based on hybridizing Simulated Annealing with gradient local searchers, like L-BGFS-B.</description>

      <title>Geometrical structures of digital fluctuations in parameter space of neural networks trained with adaptive momentum optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results of numerical experiments for neural networks with stochastic gradient-based optimization with adaptive momentum. This widely applied optimization has proved convergence and practical efficiency, but for long-run training becomes numerically unstable. We show that numerical artifacts are observable not only for large-scale models and finally lead to divergence also for case of shallow narrow networks. We argue this theory by experiments with more than 1600 neural networks trained for 50000 epochs. Local observations show presence of the same behavior of network parameters in both stable and unstable training segments. Geometrical behavior of parameters forms double twisted spirals in the parameter space and is caused by alternating of numerical perturbations with next relaxation oscillations in values for 1st and 2nd momentum.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Higher-Order Finite Element Methods for Hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a matrix-free finite element solver for finite-strain elasticity adopting an hp-multigrid preconditioner. Compared to classical algorithms relying on a global sparse matrix, matrix-free solution strategies significantly reduce memory traffic by on-the-fly evaluation of the finite element integrals. Following this approach in the context of finite-strain elasticity, the precise statement of the final weak form is crucial for performance, and it is not clear a priori whether to choose problem formulations in the material or spatial domain. With a focus on hyperelastic solids in biomechanics, the arithmetic costs to evaluate the material law at each quadrature point might favor an evaluation strategy where some quantities are precomputed in each Newton iteration and reused in the Krylov solver for the linearized problem. Hence, we discuss storage strategies to balance the compute load against memory access in compressible and incompressible neo-Hookean models and an anisotropic tissue model. Additionally, numerical stability becomes increasingly important using lower/mixed-precision ingredients and approximate preconditioners to better utilize modern hardware architectures. Application of the presented method to a patient-specific geometry of an iliac bifurcation shows significant speed-ups, especially for higher polynomial degrees, when compared to alternative approaches with matrix-based geometric or black-box algebraic multigrid preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation for Stochastic Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11581v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we set the mathematical foundations of the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA) method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). DLRA aims at approximating the solution as a linear combination of a small number of basis vectors with random coefficients (low rank format) with the peculiarity that both the basis vectors and the random coefficients vary in time. While the formulation and properties of DLRA are now well understood for random/parametric equations, the same cannot be said for SDEs and this work aims to fill this gap. We start by rigorously formulating a Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) approximation (an instance of DLRA successfully used in applications) for SDEs, which we then generalize to define a parametrization independent DLRA for SDEs. We show local well-posedness of the DO equations and their equivalence with the DLRA formulation. We also characterize the explosion time of the DO solution by a loss of linear independence of the random coefficients defining the solution expansion and give sufficient conditions for global existence.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximations and Convergence Analysis of Piecewise Diffusion Markov Processes, with Application to Glioma Cell Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on numerical approximations of Piecewise Diffusion Markov Processes (PDifMPs), particularly when the explicit flow maps are unavailable. Our approach is based on the thinning method for modelling the jump mechanism and combines the Euler-Maruyama scheme to approximate the underlying flow dynamics. For the proposed approximation schemes, we study both the mean-square and weak convergence. Weak convergence of the algorithms is established by a martingale problem formulation. Moreover, we employ these results to simulate the migration patterns exhibited by moving glioma cells at the microscopic level. Further, we develop and implement a splitting method for this PDifMP model and employ both the Thinned Euler-Maruyama and the splitting scheme in our simulation example, allowing us to compare both methods.</description>

      <title>Analysis of an Adaptive Safeguarded Newton-Anderson Algorithm of Depth One with Applications to Fluid Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to develop a practical strategy to accelerate Newton's method in the vicinity of singular points. We present an adaptive safeguarding scheme with a tunable parameter, which we call adaptive gamma-safeguarding, that one can use in tandem with Anderson acceleration to improve the performance of Newton's method when solving problems at or near singular points. The key features of adaptive gamma-safeguarding are that it converges locally for singular problems, and it can detect nonsingular problems automatically, in which case the Newton-Anderson iterates are scaled towards a standard Newton step. The result is a flexible algorithm that performs well for singular and nonsingular problems, and can recover convergence from both standard Newton and Newton-Anderson with the right parameter choice. This leads to faster local convergence compared to both Newton's method, and Newton- Anderson without safeguarding, with effectively no additional computational cost. We demonstrate three strategies one can use when implementing Newton-Anderson and gamma-safeguarded Newton-Anderson to solve parameter-dependent problems near singular points. For our benchmark problems, we take two parameter-dependent incompressible flow systems: flow in a channel and Rayleigh-Benard convection.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and compare two domain decomposition based numerical methods, namely the Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation methods (DNWR and NNWR respectively), tailored for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) incorporating time delay. Time delay phenomena frequently arise in various real-world systems, making their accurate modeling and simulation crucial for understanding and prediction. We consider a series of model problems, ranging from Parabolic, Hyperbolic to Neutral PDEs with time delay and apply the iterative techniques DNWR and NNWR for solving in parallel. We present the theoretical foundations, numerical implementation, and comparative performance analysis of these two methods. Through numerical experiments and simulations, we explore their convergence properties, computational efficiency, and applicability to various types of PDEs with time delay.</description>

      <title>A new temperature evolution equation that enforces thermodynamic vapour-liquid equilibrium in multiphase flows -- application to CO2 modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for numerically simulating the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing carbon dioxide (CO2). The framework focuses on efficient solution strategies for the coupled system of fluid flow equations and thermodynamic constraints. A key contribution lies in proposing a new set of equations for phase equilibrium calculations which simplifies the traditional vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations for two-phase CO2 mixtures. The first major novelty resides in the reduction of the conventional four-equation VLE system to a single equation, enabling efficient solution using a non-linear solver. This significantly reduces computational cost compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a second novelty is introduced by deriving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) directly from the UV-Flash equation. This ODE can be integrated alongside the governing fluid flow equations, offering a computationally efficient approach for simulating depressurization processes.</description>
