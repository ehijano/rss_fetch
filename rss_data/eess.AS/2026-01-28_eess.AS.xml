      <title>Beyond Lips: Integrating Gesture and Lip Cues for Robust Audio-visual Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most audio-visual speaker extraction methods rely on synchronized lip recording to isolate the speech of a target speaker from a multi-talker mixture. However, in natural human communication, co-speech gestures are also temporally aligned with speech, often emphasizing specific words or syllables. These gestures provide complementary visual cues that can be especially valuable when facial or lip regions are occluded or distant. In this work, we move beyond lip-centric approaches and propose SeLG, a model that integrates both lip and upper-body gesture information for robust speaker extraction. SeLG features a cross-attention-based fusion mechanism that enables each visual modality to query and selectively attend to relevant speech features in the mixture. To improve the alignment of gesture representations with speech dynamics, SeLG also employs a contrastive InfoNCE loss that encourages gesture embeddings to align more closely with corresponding lip embeddings, which are more strongly correlated with speech. Experimental results on the YGD dataset, containing TED talks, demonstrate that the proposed contrastive learning strategy significantly improves gesture-based speaker extraction, and that our proposed SeLG model, by effectively fusing lip and gesture cues with an attention mechanism and InfoNCE loss, achieves superior performance compared to baselines, across both complete and partial (i.e., missing-modality) conditions.</description>

      <title>LuSeeL: Language-queried Binaural Universal Sound Event Extraction and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most universal sound extraction algorithms focus on isolating a target sound event from single-channel audio mixtures. However, the real world is three-dimensional, and binaural audio, which mimics human hearing, can capture richer spatial information, including sound source location. This spatial context is crucial for understanding and modeling complex auditory scenes, as it inherently informs sound detection and extraction. In this work, we propose a language-driven universal sound extraction network that isolates text-described sound events from binaural mixtures by effectively leveraging the spatial cues present in binaural signals. Additionally, we jointly predict the direction of arrival (DoA) of the target sound using spatial features from the extraction network. This dual-task approach exploits complementary location information to improve extraction performance while enabling accurate DoA estimation. Experimental results on the in-the-wild AudioCaps dataset show that our proposed LuSeeL model significantly outperforms single-channel and uni-task baselines.</description>

      <title>SE-DiCoW: Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multi-speaker environments remains a major challenge. While some approaches achieve strong performance when fine-tuned on specific domains, few systems generalize well across out-of-domain datasets. Our prior work, Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information and, with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrated strong multilingual and multi-domain performance. In this paper, we address a key limitation of DiCoW: ambiguity in Silence-Target-Non-target-Overlap (STNO) masks, where two or more fully overlapping speakers may have nearly identical conditioning despite differing transcriptions. We introduce SE-DiCoW (Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper), which uses diarization output to locate an enrollment segment anywhere in the conversation where the target speaker is most active. This enrollment segment is used as fixed conditioning via cross-attention at each encoder layer. We further refine DiCoW with improved data segmentation, model initialization, and augmentation. Together, these advances yield substantial gains: SE-DiCoW reduces macro-averaged tcpWER by 52.4% relative to the original DiCoW on the EMMA MT-ASR benchmark.</description>

      <title>Permutation-Invariant Physics-Informed Neural Network for Region-to-Region Sound Field Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing sound field reconstruction methods target point-to-region reconstruction, interpolating the Acoustic Transfer Functions (ATFs) between a fixed-position sound source and a receiver region. The applicability of these methods is limited because real-world ATFs tend to varying continuously with respect to the positions of sound sources and receiver regions. This paper presents a permutation-invariant physics-informed neural network for region-to-region sound field reconstruction, which aims to interpolate the ATFs across continuously varying sound sources and measurement regions. The proposed method employs a deep set architecture to process the receiver and sound source positions as an unordered set, preserving acoustic reciprocity. Furthermore, it incorporates the Helmholtz equation as a physical constraint to guide network training, ensuring physically consistent predictions.</description>

      <title>Audio Deepfake Detection at the First Greeting: "Hi!"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on audio deepfake detection under real-world communication degradations, with an emphasis on ultra-short inputs (0.5-2.0s), targeting the capability to detect synthetic speech at a conversation opening, e.g., when a scammer says "Hi." We propose Short-MGAA (S-MGAA), a novel lightweight extension of Multi-Granularity Adaptive Time-Frequency Attention, designed to enhance discriminative representation learning for short, degraded inputs subjected to communication processing and perturbations. The S-MGAA integrates two tailored modules: a Pixel-Channel Enhanced Module (PCEM) that amplifies fine-grained time-frequency saliency, and a Frequency Compensation Enhanced Module (FCEM) to supplement limited temporal evidence via multi-scale frequency modeling and adaptive frequency-temporal interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S-MGAA consistently surpasses nine state-of-the-art baselines while achieving strong robustness to degradations and favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, including low RTF, competitive GFLOPs, compact parameters, and reduced training cost, highlighting its strong potential for real-time deployment in communication systems and edge devices.</description>

      <title>SAM Audio Judge: A Unified Multimodal Framework for Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance evaluation remains a complex challenge in audio separation, and existing evaluation metrics are often misaligned with human perception, course-grained, relying on ground truth signals. On the other hand, subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for real-world evaluation, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of evaluating audio separation without human intervention. The proposed evaluation metric, SAM Audio Judge (SAJ), is a multimodal fine-grained reference-free objective metric, which shows highly alignment with human perceptions. SAJ supports three audio domains (speech, music and general sound events) and three prompt inputs (text, visual and span), covering four different dimensions of evaluation (recall, percision, faithfulness, and overall). SAM Audio Judge also shows potential applications in data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets and reranking in audio separation models. We release our code and pre-trained models at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-audio.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Discrete Speech Representation Tokens for Accent Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete Speech Representation Tokens (DSRTs) have become a foundational component in speech generation. While prior work has extensively studied phonetic and speaker information in DSRTs, how accent information is encoded in DSRTs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of accent information in DSRTs. We propose a unified evaluation framework that measures both accessibility of accent information via a novel Accent ABX task and recoverability via cross-accent Voice Conversion (VC) resynthesis. Using this framework, we analyse DSRTs derived from a variety of speech encoders. Our results reveal that accent information is substantially reduced when ASR supervision is used to fine-tune the encoder, but cannot be effectively disentangled from phonetic and speaker information through naive codebook size reduction. Based on these findings, we propose new content-only and content-accent DSRTs that significantly outperform existing designs in controllable accent generation. Our work highlights the importance of accent-aware evaluation and provides practical guidance for designing DSRTs for accent-controlled speech generation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition using Dynamic Spectral Features and Kalman Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition systems often use static features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), and Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE). Because of this, they can misclassify emotions when there is acoustic noise in vocal signals. To address this, we added dynamic features using Dynamic Spectral features (Deltas and Delta-Deltas) along with the Kalman Smoothing algorithm. This approach reduces noise and improves emotion classification. Since emotion changes over time, the Kalman Smoothing filter also helped make the classifier outputs more stable. Tests on the RAVDESS dataset showed that this method achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 87\% and reduced misclassification between emotions with similar acoustic features</description>

      <title>Audio Foundation Models Outperform Symbolic Representations for Piano Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated piano performance evaluation traditionally relies on symbolic (MIDI) representations, which capture note-level information but miss the acoustic nuances that characterize expressive playing. I propose using pre-trained audio foundation models, specifically MuQ and MERT, to predict 19 perceptual dimensions of piano performance quality. Using synthesized audio from PercePiano MIDI files (rendered via Pianoteq), I compare audio and symbolic approaches under controlled conditions where both derive from identical source data. The best model, MuQ layers 9-12 with Pianoteq soundfont augmentation, achieves R^2 = 0.537 (95% CI: [0.465, 0.575]), representing a 55% improvement over the symbolic baseline (R^2 = 0.347). Statistical analysis confirms significance (p &lt; 10^-25) with audio outperforming symbolic on all 19 dimensions. I validate the approach through cross-soundfont generalization (R^2 = 0.534 +/- 0.075), difficulty correlation with an external dataset (rho = 0.623), and multi-performer consistency analysis. Analysis of audio-symbolic fusion reveals high error correlation (r = 0.738), explaining why fusion provides minimal benefit: audio representations alone are sufficient. I release the complete training pipeline, pretrained models, and inference code.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Discriminative and Generative System for Universal Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal speech enhancement aims at handling inputs with various speech distortions and recording conditions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid architecture that synergizes the signal fidelity of discriminative modeling with the reconstruction capabilities of generative modeling. Our system utilizes the discriminative TF-GridNet model with the Sampling-Frequency-Independent strategy to handle variable sampling rates universally. In parallel, an autoregressive model combined with spectral mapping modeling generates detail-rich speech while effectively suppressing generative artifacts. Finally, a fusion network learns adaptive weights of the two outputs under the optimization of signal-level losses and the comprehensive Speech Quality Assessment (SQA) loss. Our proposed system is evaluated in the ICASSP 2026 URGENT Challenge (Track 1) and ranks the third place.</description>

      <title>Phase-Retrieval-Based Physics-Informed Neural Networks For Acoustic Magnitude Field Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for estimating the magnitude distribution of an acoustic field from spatially sparse magnitude measurements. Such a method is useful when phase measurements are unreliable or inaccessible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise for sound field estimation by incorporating constraints derived from governing partial differential equations (PDEs) into neural networks. However, they do not extend to settings where phase measurements are unavailable, as the loss function based on the governing PDE relies on phase information. To remedy this, we propose a phase-retrieval-based PINN for magnitude field estimation. By representing the magnitude and phase distributions with separate networks, the PDE loss can be computed based on the reconstructed complex amplitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our phase-retrieval-based PINN through experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>GMS-CAVP: Improving Audio-Video Correspondence with Multi-Scale Contrastive and Generative Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.</description>

      <title>Why Do Speech Language Models Fail to Generate Semantically Coherent Outputs? A Modality Evolving Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although text-based large language models exhibit human-level writing ability and remarkable intelligence, speech language models (SLMs) still struggle to generate semantically coherent outputs. There are several potential reasons for this performance degradation: (A) speech tokens mainly provide phonetic information rather than semantic information, (B) the length of speech sequences is much longer than that of text sequences, and (C) paralinguistic information, such as prosody, introduces additional complexity and variability. In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling. Based on these findings, we provide insights into the unique challenges of training SLMs and highlight pathways to develop more effective end-to-end SLMs.</description>

      <title>EDM2SE: A Magnitude-Preserving Network Architecture for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study diffusion-based speech enhancement using a Schrodinger bridge formulation and extend the EDM2 framework to this setting. We employ time-dependent preconditioning of network inputs and outputs to stabilize training and explore two skip-connection configurations that allow the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. To control activation and weight magnitudes, we adopt a magnitude-preserving architecture and learn the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for improved conditioning. We further analyze the impact of exponential moving average (EMA) parameter smoothing by approximating different EMA profiles post training, finding that, unlike in image generation, short or absent EMA consistently yields better speech enhancement performance. Experiments on VoiceBank-DEMAND and EARS-WHAM demonstrate competitive signal-to-distortion ratios and perceptual scores, with the two skip-connection variants exhibiting complementary strengths. These findings provide new insights into EMA behavior, magnitude preservation, and skip-connection design for diffusion-based speech enhancement.</description>

      <title>Confidence intervals for forced alignment boundaries using model ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics. Having confidence intervals provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the boundary placement, facilitating tasks like finding boundaries that should be reviewed. As a bonus, on the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a slight overall improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals can be emitted during the alignment process as JSON files and a main table for programmatic and statistical analysis. For familiarity, they are also output as Praat TextGrids using a point tier to represent the intervals.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Paediatric Sleep Apnoea Detection Using Physiology-Guided Acoustic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paediatric obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is clinically significant yet difficult to diagnose, as children poorly tolerate sensor-based polysomnography. Acoustic monitoring provides a non-invasive alternative for home-based OSA screening, but limited paediatric data hinders the development of robust deep learning approaches. This paper proposes a transfer learning framework that adapts acoustic models pretrained on adult sleep data to paediatric OSA detection, incorporating SpO2-based desaturation patterns to enhance model training. Using a large adult sleep dataset (157 nights) and a smaller paediatric dataset (15 nights), we systematically evaluate (i) single- versus multi-task learning, (ii) encoder freezing versus full fine-tuning, and (iii) the impact of delaying SpO2 labels to better align them with the acoustics and capture physiologically meaningful features. Results show that fine-tuning with SpO2 integration consistently improves paediatric OSA detection compared with baseline models without adaptation. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of transfer learning for home-based OSA screening in children and offer its potential clinical value for early diagnosis.</description>

      <title>SoundCompass: Navigating Target Sound Extraction With Effective Directional Clue Integration In Complex Acoustic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in target sound extraction (TSE) utilize directional clues derived from direction of arrival (DoA), which represent an inherent spatial property of sound available in any acoustic scene. However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.</description>

      <title>Short-Segment Speaker Verification with Pre-trained Models and Multi-Resolution Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker verification (SV) utilizing features obtained from models pre-trained via self-supervised learning has recently demonstrated impressive performances. However, these pre-trained models (PTMs) usually have a temporal resolution of 20 ms, which is lower than typical filterbank features. It may be problematic especially for short-segment SV with an input segment shorter than 2 s, in which we need to extract as much information as possible from the input with a limited length. Although there have been approaches to utilize multi-resolution features from the HuBERT models, the window shifts were 20, 40, and 100 ms when the sampling rate was 16 kHz and thus only lower resolution features were considered. In this study, we propose an SV system which utilizes PTM features along with filterbank features and those from the multi-resolution time domain encoder with window shifts of 1.56, 3.13, 6.25, and 12.5 ms. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb dataset with various input lengths showed consistent improvements over systems with various combinations of input features.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised lexicon learning from speech is limited by representations rather than clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features (continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features. Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary factor limiting performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Slimmable Speech Enhancement Network with Metric-Guided Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To further reduce the complexity of lightweight speech enhancement models, we introduce a gating-based Dynamically Slimmable Network (DSN). The DSN comprises static and dynamic components. For architecture-independent applicability, we introduce distinct dynamic structures targeting the commonly used components, namely, grouped recurrent neural network units, multi-head attention, convolutional, and fully connected layers. A policy module adaptively governs the use of dynamic parts at a frame-wise resolution according to the input signal quality, controlling computational load. We further propose Metric-Guided Training (MGT) to explicitly guide the policy module in assessing input speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the DSN achieves comparable enhancement performance in instrumental metrics to the state-of-the-art lightweight baseline, while using only 73% of its computational load on average. Evaluations of dynamic component usage ratios indicate that the MGT-DSN can appropriately allocate network resources according to the severity of input signal distortion.</description>

      <title>Empowering Multimodal Respiratory Sound Classification with Counterfactual Adversarial Debiasing for Out-of-Distribution Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal respiratory sound classification offers promise for early pulmonary disease detection by integrating bioacoustic signals with patient metadata. Nevertheless, current approaches remain vulnerable to spurious correlations from attributes such as age, sex, or acquisition device, which hinder their generalization, especially under distribution shifts across clinical sites. To this end, we propose a counterfactual adversarial debiasing framework. First, we employ a causal graph-based counterfactual debiasing methodology to suppress non-causal dependencies from patient metadata. Second, we introduce adversarial debiasing to learn metadata-insensitive representations and reduce metadata-specific biases. Third, we design counterfactual metadata augmentation to mitigate spurious correlations further and strengthen metadata-invariant representations. By doing so, our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in evaluations under both in-distribution and distribution shifts. Code is available at https://github.com/RSC-Toolkit/BTS-CARD.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Attention Sinks and Massive Activations in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced auditory speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR), and audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.</description>

      <title>Omni-AVSR: Towards Unified Multimodal Speech Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Stream-Voice-Anon: Enhancing Utility of Real-Time Speaker Anonymization via Neural Audio Codec and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protecting speaker identity is crucial for online voice applications, yet streaming speaker anonymization (SA) remains underexplored. Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.</description>

      <title>SingMOS-Pro: An Comprehensive Benchmark for Singing Quality Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro extends the annotations of the additional data to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent state-of-the-art approaches. Each clip is rated by at least five experienced annotators to ensure reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we investigate strategies for effectively utilizing MOS data annotated under heterogeneous standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TangRain/SingMOS-Pro.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multimodal Person Recognition: A Robust Framework for Handling Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Person identification systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently present with missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal person identification framework incorporating upper-body motion, face, and voice. Experimental results demonstrate that body motion outperforms traditional modalities such as face and voice in within-session evaluations, while serving as a complementary cue that enhances performance in multi-session scenarios. Our model employs a unified hybrid fusion strategy, fusing both feature-level and score-level information to maximize representational richness and decision accuracy. Specifically, it leverages multi-task learning to process modalities independently, followed by cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to exploit both unimodal information and cross-modal interactions. Finally, a confidence-weighted strategy and mistake-correction mechanism dynamically adapt to missing data, ensuring that our single classification head achieves optimal performance even in unimodal and bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark in this work for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed trimodal system achieves 99.51% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a widely used evaluation protocol and reach 99.92% accuracy in bimodal mode, outperforming conventional approaches. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.</description>
