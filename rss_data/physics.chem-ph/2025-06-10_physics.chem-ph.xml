      <title>ChemGraph: An Agentic Framework for Computational Chemistry Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science, accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>Light-Matter Entanglement in Real-Time Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Polariton Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular polaritons are hybrid light-matter states that enable the exploration of potential cavity-modified chemistry. The development of dynamical, first-principles approaches for simulating molecular polaritons is important for understanding their origins and properties. Herein, we present a hierarchy of first-principles methods to simulate the real-time dynamics of molecular polaritons in the strong coupling regime. These methods are based on real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) and the corresponding real-time nuclear-electronic orbital (RT-NEO) approach, in which specified nuclei are treated quantum mechanically on the same level as the electrons. The hierarchy spans semiclassical, mean-field-quantum, and full-quantum approaches to simulate polariton dynamics under both electronic strong coupling and vibrational strong coupling. In the semiclassical approaches, the cavity mode is treated classically, whereas in the full-quantum approaches, the cavity mode is treated quantum mechanically with propagation of a joint molecule-mode density matrix. The semiclassical and full-quantum approaches produce virtually identical Rabi splittings and polariton peak locations for the systems studied. However, the full-quantum approaches allow exploration of molecule-mode quantum entanglement in the real-time dynamics. Although the degree of light-matter entanglement is relatively small in the systems considered, the oscillations of the von Neumann entropy reveal an entanglement Rabi splitting that differs from the Rabi splitting computed from the time-dependent dipole moment. These results suggest that a classical treatment of the cavity mode may provide an excellent description of polariton dynamics for macroscopic observables such as the Rabi splitting, but novel physics may be detectable by considering molecule-mode entanglement.</description>

      <title>Nearest neighbor permutation entropy detects phase transitions in complex high-pressure systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the high-pressure phase behavior of carbon dioxide-hydrocarbon mixtures is of considerable interest owing to their wide range of applications. Under certain conditions, these systems are not amenable to direct visual monitoring, and experimentalists often rely on spectrophotometric data to infer phase behavior. Consequently, developing computationally efficient and robust methods to leverage such data is crucial. Here, we combine nearest neighbor permutation entropy, computed directly from in situ near-infrared absorbance spectra acquired during depressurization trials of mixtures of carbon dioxide and a distilled petroleum fraction, with an anomaly detection approach to identify phase transitions. We show that changes in nearest neighbor entropy effectively signal transitions from initially homogeneous mixtures to two-phase equilibria, thereby enabling accurate out-of-sample online predictions of transition pressures. Our approach requires minimum data preprocessing, no specialized detection techniques or visual inspection of the spectra, and is sufficiently general to be adapted for studying phase behavior in other high-pressure systems monitored via spectrophotometry.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Forward and Inverse Potential-Density Mappings in Classical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators are capable of capturing nonlinear mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, offering a data-driven approach to modeling complex functional relationships in classical density functional theory (cDFT). In this work, we evaluate the performance of several neural operator architectures in learning the functional relationships between the one-body density profile $\rho(x)$, the one-body direct correlation function $c_1(x)$, and the external potential $V_{ext}(x)$ of inhomogeneous one-dimensional (1D) hard-rod fluids, using training data generated from analytical solutions of the underlying statistical-mechanical model. We compared their performance in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss in establishing the functional relationships as well as in predicting the excess free energy across two test sets: (1) a group test set generated via random cross-validation (CV) to assess interpolation capability, and (2) a newly constructed dataset for leave-one-group CV to evaluate extrapolation performance. Our results show that FNO achieves the most accurate predictions of the excess free energy, with the squared ReLU activation function outperforming other activation choices. Among the DeepONet variants, the Residual Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (RMSCNN) combined with a trainable Gaussian derivative kernel (GK-RMSCNN-DeepONet) demonstrates the best performance. Additionally, we applied the trained models to solve for the density profiles at various external potentials and compared the results with those obtained from the direct mapping $V_{ext} \mapsto \rho$ with neural operators, as well as with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) combined with Active Learning by Error Control (ALEC), which has shown strong performance in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing PySCF-based Quantum Chemistry Simulations with Modern Hardware, Algorithms, and Python Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PySCF package has emerged as a powerful and flexible open-source platform for quantum chemistry simulations. However, the efficiency of electronic structure calculations can vary significantly depending on the choice of computational techniques and hardware utilization. In this paper, we explore strategies to enhance research productivity and computational performance in PySCF-based simulations. First, we discuss GPU acceleration for selected PySCF modules. Second, we demonstrate algorithmic optimizations for particular computational tasks, such as the initial guess manipulation, the second-order self-consistent field (SOSCF) methods, multigrid integration, and density fitting approximation, to improve convergence rates and computational efficiency. Finally, we explore the use of modern Python tools, including just-in-time (JIT) compilation and automatic differentiation to accelerate code development and execution. These approaches present a practical guide for enhancing the use of PySCF's capabilities in quantum chemistry research.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Cost Two-component Relativistic Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster Method for Ionization Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an efficient implementation of the ionization potential (IP) variant of the equation-of-motion coupled cluster (IP-EOM-CC) method based on the exact two-component atomic mean field (X2CAMF) framework, utilizing Cholesky decomposition (CD) and frozen natural spinors (FNS). The CD approximation significantly reduces memory demands, whereas the FNS approximation lowers the number of floating-point operations. Together, these techniques make the method computationally efficient for accurate relativistic IP-EOM-CC calculations of molecules containing heavy elements. The calculated IP values are almost identical to those obtained by the four-component relativistic IP-EOM-CC method. Benchmark studies show good agreement with experimental ionization energies and photoelectron spectra, demonstrating the method's reliability. The practical applicability of the approach is demonstrated by IP calculations on the medium-sized [I(H$_{2}$O)$_{12}$]$^{-}$ complex, with 1698 virtual spinors.</description>

      <title>Polaron-Polariton Assisted Thermally Activated Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07110v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict an anomalous thermally activated superradiance in molecular aggregates within polaritonic environments. In contrast to free space, the collective emission is enhanced when either the exciton-phonon coupling or the temperature increases. This counterintuitive phenomenon is captured by a microscopic theory that combines macroscopic quantum electrodynamics with a modified polaron quantum master equation approach, revealing a nontrivial interplay among excitons, phonons, and polaritons.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Simulation of Static Disorder in Quantum Dynamics with Equilibrium Initial State via Matrix Product State Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static disorder plays a crucial role in the electronic dynamics and spectroscopy of complex molecular systems. Traditionally, obtaining observables averaged over static disorder requires thousands of realizations via direct sampling of the disorder distribution, leading to high computational costs. In this work, we extend the auxiliary degree-of-freedom based matrix product state (MPS) method to handle system-bath correlated thermal equilibrium initial states. We validate the effectiveness of the extended method by computing the dipole-dipole time correlation function of the Holstein model relevant to the emission spectrum of molecular aggregates. Our results show that the method accurately captures static disorder effects using a one-shot quantum dynamical simulation, with only a moderate increase in MPS bond dimension, thereby significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, it enables the generation of a much larger number of samples than the conventional direct sampling method at negligible additional cost, thus reducing statistical errors. This method provides a broadly useful tool for calculating equilibrium time correlation functions in system-bath coupled models with static disorder.</description>

      <title>Imaging transient molecular configurations in UV-excited diiodomethane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond structural dynamics of diiodomethane ($\mathrm{CH_2I_2}$) triggered by ultraviolet (UV) photoabsorption at 290 nm and 330 nm are studied using time-resolved coincident Coulomb explosion imaging driven by a near-infrared probe pulse. We map the dominant single-photon process, the cleavage of the carbon-iodine bond producing rotationally excited $\mathrm{CH_2I}$ radical, identify the contributions of the three-body ($\mathrm{CH_2} + \mathrm{I} + \mathrm{I}$) dissociation and molecular iodine formation channels, which are primarily driven by the absorption of more than one UV photon, and demonstrate the existence of a weak reaction pathway involving the formation of short-lived transient species resembling iso-$\mathrm{CH_2I{-}I}$ geometries with a slightly shorter I-I separation compared to the ground-state $\mathrm{CH_2I_2}$. These transient molecular configurations, which can be separated from the other channels by applying a set of conditions on the correlated momenta of three ionic fragments, are formed within approximately 100 fs after the initial photoexcitation and decay within the next 100 fs.</description>

      <title>Mutual Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying correlation and complexity in quantum many-body states is central to advancing theoretical and computational chemistry, physics, and quantum information science. This work introduces a novel framework, mutual correlation, based on the Frobenius norm squared of the two-body reduced density matrix cumulant. Through systematic partitioning of the cumulant norm, mutual correlation quantifies nonadditive correlations among interacting subsystems. Benchmark studies on model systems, including H$_{10}$, N$_{2}$, and p-benzyne, demonstrate its efficacy and computational advantage compared to entropy-based metrics such as orbital mutual information. Maximally correlated orbitals, obtained by maximizing a nonlinear cost function of the mutual correlation, are also considered to identify a basis-independent partitioning of correlation. This study suggests that mutual correlation is a broadly applicable metric, useful in active space selection and the interpretation of electronic states.</description>

      <title>Scalable Neural Quantum State based Kernel Polynomial Method for Optical Properties from the First Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational optimization of neural-network quantum state representations has achieved FCI-level accuracy for ground state calculations, yet computing optical properties involving excited states remains challenging. In this work, we present a neural-network-based variational quantum Monte Carlo approach for ab-initio absorption spectra. We leverage parallel batch autoregressive sampling and GPU-supported local energy parallelism to efficiently compute ground states of complex systems. By integrating neural quantum ground states with the kernel polynomial method, our approach accurately calculates absorption spectra for large molecules with over 50 electrons, achieving FCI-level precision. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior scalability and reduced runtime compared to FCI, marking a significant step forward in optical property calculations for large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The role of spin-orbit coupling and state-crossing topography in the non-radiative decay of Ir(III) complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pillar of our current understanding of the photoluminescence of Ir(III) complexes is the assumption that the population of triplet metal-centered states determines an efficient non-radiative decay to the ground state minimum. Based on that assumption, the energy separation between the emitting state and the minimum-energy crossing point of the triplet metal-centered and the ground states has been employed as a key variable for evaluating the ability of Ir(III) complexes to decay non-radiatively. We demonstrate that the strong spin-orbit coupling between the triplet metal-centered and the ground state of Ir(III) complexes, together with the sloped topography of their crossing, lead to a significant energy separation between the two states, resulting in a reduced rate of non-radiative ground state recovery. Therefore, we propose that the role of metal-centered states is defined by the tendency of the excited state population to remain trapped in the metal-centered minima.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger equation with Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and double well potential as model of vibrationally enhanced tunneling for proton transfer in hydrogen bond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solution of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and trigonometric double-well potential is obtained within the framework of the first-order of adiabatic approximation. The case of vibrational strong coupling is considered which is pertinent for polariton chemistry and (presumably) for enzymatic hydrogen transfer. We exemplify the application of the solution by calculating the proton transfer rate constant in the hydrogen bond of the Zundel ion ${\rm{H_5O_2^{+}}}$ (oxonium hydrate) within the framework of the Weiner's theory. An analytic formula is derived which provides the calculation of the proton transfer rate with the help of elements implemented in {\sl {Mathematica}}. The parameters of the model for the Zundel ion are extracted from the literature data on IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The approach yields a vivid manifestation of the phenomenon of vibrationally enhanced tunneling, i.e., a sharp bell-shaped peak of the rate enhancement by the external vibration at its symmetric coupling to the proton coordinate. The results obtained testify that the effect of resonant activation in our model is robust and stable to variations in the types of the quadratically coupled mode (vibrational strong coupling or symmetric one).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Analysis of Combustion and Ignition in As-milled and Annealed Al/Zr Composite Powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micron-scale metal-based composite powders are promising for energetic applications due to their tailored ignition and combustion properties. In particular, ball-milled Al/Zr composites exhibit lower ignition thresholds than pure aluminum, driven by exothermic intermetallic formation reactions and have demonstrated enhanced combustion properties. However, the extent to which this heat release governs ignition and combustion remains unclear, especially when progressively removed through annealing. To systematically investigate this effect, we synthesized Al/Zr powders (3Al:Zr, Al:Zr, and Al:3Zr at%) via ball milling, annealed them in argon up to 1000 C to partially complete the formation reactions, and characterized their ignition and combustion behavior. Ignition thresholds were measured using a hot wire method across different environments, while high-speed hyperspectral imaging tracked single-particle burn durations and temperatures. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method was developed to quantify the frequency of microexplosions. Results show that annealing - and thus reducing available reaction heat - increases ignition thresholds, most significantly for Al-rich compositions. In contrast, Zr-rich powders exhibit little change in ignition thresholds due to oxidation aiding ignition. Despite removing the available heat that drives ignition, average combustion temperatures range from 2400-3000 K and increased with annealing for Al- and Zr-rich powders. Average maximum temperatures are 100 to 400 K higher. The frequency of microexplosions remains high (&gt;46%) and increases with annealing for all but the Al-rich powders. These findings suggest that while homogeneous Al/Zr powders (e.g., atomized) may exhibit higher ignition thresholds, they can achieve comparable combustion performance once ignited.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Chemical Insights: Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers</title>

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency.

      <title>Optimal Fluctuations for Nonlinear Chemical Reaction Systems with General Rate Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal fluctuations for chemical reaction systems with N species, M reactions, and general rate law. In the limit of large volume, large fluctuations for such models occur with overwhelming probability in the vicinity of the so-called optimal path, which is a basic consequence of the Freidlin-Wentzell theory, and is vital in biochemistry as it unveils the almost deterministic mechanism concealed behind rare noisy phenomena such as escapes from the attractive domain of a stable state and transitions between different metastable states. In this study, an alternative description for optimal fluctuations is proposed in both non-stationary and stationary settings by means of a quantity called prehistory probability in the same setting, respectively. The evolution law of each of them is derived, showing their relationship with the time reversal of a specified family of probability distributions respectively. The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the reversed processes are then proved. In doing so, the prehistorical approach to optimal fluctuations for Langevin dynamics is naturally generalized to the present case, thereby suggesting a strong connection between optimal fluctuations and the time reversal of the chemical reaction model.</description>

      <title>Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. While we also observe our predicted instability in discrete-time simulations for small system sizes, discrete-time simulations of large systems show stability in the discrepant region even for long simulation times. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part II: non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</description>

      <title>Predicting aqueous and electrochemical stability of 2D materials from extended Pourbaix analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge for computational discovery of electrocatalytic materials is the reliable prediction of thermodynamic stability in aqueous environment and under different electrochemical conditions. In this work, we first evaluate the electrochemical stability of more than 3000 two-dimensional (2D) materials using conventional Pourbaix diagrams (CPDs). Due to the complete neglect of thermodynamic barriers along the (often complex) reaction pathways, the vast majority of the materials are predicted to be unstable even though some are known to be stable in practice. We then introduce an analysis based on the surface Pourbaix diagram (SPD) including 'early intermediate states' that represent the first steps of the key surface passivation and dissolution reactions. The SPD framework is applied to the 2D materials MoS$_2$, phosphorene, and the MXene Ti$_2$C, all of which are predicted to be unstable by the CPD. For MoS$_2$, our approach reproduces the experimental pH-U stability window as well as the experimental desulphurization potential. For phosphorene and Ti2$_C$, the SPD approach is used to investigate the spontaneous degradation mechanism and the potential-dependent surface termination, respectively, again yielding good agreement with experiments. The SPD-based stability analysis emerges as a versatile and quantitative method for prediction of stability and investigation of surface structures in electrochemical environments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous imaging of vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-induced molecular dynamics often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Since the ensuing electronic and nuclear motion determines the pathways and outcomes of photoinduced reactions, our ability to monitor and understand these dynamics is crucial for molecular physics, physical chemistry, and photobiology. However, characterizing this complex motion represents a significant challenge when different degrees of freedom are strongly coupled. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) and quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map the bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the consequences of nuclear motion for the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. Our results demonstrate that multi-coincident CEI can be an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing eigensolver as a NISQ era tool for probing strong correlation effects in quantum chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is arguably the most popular noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era approach to quantum chemistry. We consider the underexplored quantum annealing eigensolver (QAE) algorithm as a worthy alternative. We use a combination of numerical calculations for a system where strong correlation effects dominate, and conclusions drawn from our preliminary scaling analysis for QAE and VQE to make the case for QAE as a NISQ era contender to VQE for quantum chemistry. For the former, we pick the representative example of computing avoided crossings in the H4 molecule in a rectangular geometry, and demonstrate that we obtain results to within about 1.2% of the full configuration interaction value on the D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Following our numerical results, we carry out a detailed yet preliminary analysis of the scaling behaviours of both the QAE and the VQE algorithms to assess the competency of the former for NISQ era chemistry.</description>

      <title>Towards ab initio Realizations of Collins' Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ab initio approach formulated under an entropy-inspired repartitioning of the electronic Hamiltonian is presented. This ansatz produces orbital eigenvalues each shifted by entropic contributions expressed as subsets of scaled pair correlation energy terms present in second-order Moller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory. Under the auspices of Collins' conjecture, which suggests that the electron correlation energy is approximately proportional to the Jaynes entropy of the one-electron density matrix, we introduce a parameter that controls the accuracy of the resultant one-electron density at the MP2 level. By tuning the density in a somewhat automated way, we achieve one-electron densities on par with those from full configuration interaction for single-bond dissociation. This parameter can then be used to add a Collins'-like static correlation correction to the energy functional, capturing both dynamical and nondynamical correlation effects in many-electron systems. The performance of the proposed method and its related variants approaches the accuracy of generalized valence bond theory for estimating single bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for set of small, closed-shell molecules composed of first and second row elements. Our results hold implications for reincorporating the missing (static) correlation energy in regularized perturbation theories that is typically discarded. Finally, we propose generic BDE parameters (accurate to within 7% on average) that could be used for strongly-correlated systems in general.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parallelization of Message Passing Neural Network Potentials for Large-scale Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials have achieved great success in accelerating atomistic simulations. Many of them relying on atom-centered local descriptors are natural for parallelization. More recent message passing neural network (MPNN) models have demonstrated their superior accuracy and become increasingly popular. However, efficiently parallelizing MPNN models across multiple nodes remains challenging, limiting their practical applications in large-scale simulations. Here, we propose an efficient parallel algorithm for MPNN models, in which additional data communication is minimized among local atoms only in each MP layer without redundant computation, thus scaling linearly with the layer number. Integrated with our recursively embedded atom neural network model, this algorithm demonstrates excellent strong scaling and weak scaling behaviors in several benchmark systems. This approach enables massive molecular dynamics simulations on MPNN models as fast as on strictly local models for over 100 million atoms, vastly extending the applicability of the MPNN potential to an unprecedented scale. This general parallelization framework can empower various MPNN models to efficiently simulate very large and complex systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics Predicts Coherent Oscillatory Behavior in the Early-times of a Photoisomerization Reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quantum dynamics of a photoisomerization reaction employing a two-electronic-state three-vibrational-mode model of the 2-cis-penta-2,4-dieniminium cation (cis-PSB3). In particular, we address two main issues: the challenges encountered in properly converging quantum dynamics calculations, even when a reduced-dimensionality molecular model is used; the emergence of a coherent oscillatory behavior in the formation of the trans isomer upon photoexcitation of cis-PSB3. The two issues are strictly related, since only upon reliable convergence, the simulated dynamics is able to capture the large amplitude motion associated to the torsion around the reactive bond, typical of photoisomerizations, which is due to the large amount of kinetic energy acquired by the vibrational modes after light excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-linear scaling method to simulate open and correlated quantum systems out of equilibrium. The method inherits from many-body perturbation theory the possibility to choose selectively the most relevant scattering processes in the dynamics, thereby paving the way to the real-time characterization of correlated ultrafast phenomena in quantum transport. The open system dynamics is described in terms of an embedding correlator from which the time-dependent current can be calculated using the Meir-Wingreen formula. We show how to efficiently implement our approach through a simple grafting into recently proposed time-linear Green's function methods for closed systems. Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions can be treated on equal footing while preserving all fundametal conservation laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to increasingly grant them autonomy, freeing them from time-dependent external control. For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset a superconducting qubit to near its ground state, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from 530 to 1000 nm (-6000 to 2800 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) provides an alternative to optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a fraction of the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>
