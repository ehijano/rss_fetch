      <title>Integrating Biological-Informed Recurrent Neural Networks for Glucose-Insulin Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19158v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management is a complex task due to many variability factors. Artificial Pancreas (AP) systems have alleviated patient burden by automating insulin delivery through advanced control algorithms. However, the effectiveness of these systems depends on accurate modeling of glucose-insulin dynamics, which traditional mathematical models often fail to capture due to their inability to adapt to patient-specific variations. This study introduces a Biological-Informed Recurrent Neural Network (BIRNN) framework to address these limitations. The BIRNN leverages a Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) architecture augmented with physics-informed loss functions that embed physiological constraints, ensuring a balance between predictive accuracy and consistency with biological principles. The framework is validated using the commercial UVA/Padova simulator, outperforming traditional linear models in glucose prediction accuracy and reconstruction of unmeasured states, even under circadian variations in insulin sensitivity. The results demonstrate the potential of BIRNN for personalized glucose regulation and future adaptive control strategies in AP systems.</description>

      <title>Protein Structure-Function Relationship: A Kernel-PCA Approach for Reaction Coordinate Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a Kernel-PCA model designed to capture structure-function relationships in a protein. This model also enables ranking of reaction coordinates according to their impact on protein properties. By leveraging machine learning techniques, including Kernel and principal component analysis (PCA), our model uncovers meaningful patterns in high-dimensional protein data obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The effectiveness of our model in accurately identifying reaction coordinates has been demonstrated through its application to a G protein-coupled receptor. Furthermore, this model utilizes a network-based approach to uncover correlations in the dynamic behavior of residues associated with a specific protein property. These findings underscore the potential of our model as a powerful tool for protein structure-function analysis and visualization.</description>

      <title>Exact identifiability analysis for a class of partially observed near-linear stochastic differential equation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochasticity plays a key role in many biological systems, necessitating the calibration of stochastic mathematical models to interpret associated data. For model parameters to be estimated reliably, it is typically the case that they must be structurally identifiable. Yet, while theory underlying structural identifiability analysis for deterministic differential equation models is highly developed, there are currently no tools for the general assessment of stochastic models. In this work, we extend the well-established differential algebra framework for structural identifiability analysis to linear and a class of near-linear, two-dimensional, partially observed stochastic differential equation (SDE) models. Our framework is based on a deterministic recurrence relation that describes the dynamics of the statistical moments of the system of SDEs. From this relation, we iteratively form a series of necessarily satisfied equations involving only the observed moments, from which we are able to establish structurally identifiable parameter combinations. We demonstrate our framework for a suite of linear (two- and $n$-dimensional) and non-linear (two-dimensional) models. Most importantly, we define the notion of structural identifiability for SDE models and establish the effect of the initial condition on identifiability. We conclude with a discussion on the applicability and limitations of our approach, and potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>mRNA Folding Algorithms for Structure and Codon Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: mRNA technology has revolutionized vaccine development, protein replacement therapies, and cancer immunotherapies, offering rapid production and precise control over sequence and efficacy. However, the inherent instability of mRNA poses significant challenges for drug storage and distribution, particularly in resource-limited regions. Co-optimizing RNA structure and codon choice has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance mRNA stability while preserving efficacy. Given the vast sequence and structure design space, specialized algorithms are essential to achieve these qualities. Recently, several effective algorithms have been developed to tackle this challenge that all use similar underlying principles. We call these specialized algorithms "mRNA folding" algorithms as they generalize classical RNA folding algorithms. A comprehensive analysis of their underlying principles, performance, and limitations is lacking. This review aims to provide an in-depth understanding of these algorithms, identify opportunities for improvement, and benchmark existing software implementations in terms of scalability, correctness, and feature support.</description>

      <title>Single Shot AI-assisted quantification of KI-67 proliferation index in breast cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable quantification of Ki-67, a key proliferation marker in breast cancer, is essential for molecular subtyping and informed treatment planning. Conventional approaches, including visual estimation and manual counting, suffer from interobserver variability and limited reproducibility. This study introduces an AI-assisted method using the YOLOv8 object detection framework for automated Ki-67 scoring. High-resolution digital images (40x magnification) of immunohistochemically stained tumor sections were captured from Ki-67 hotspot regions and manually annotated by a domain expert to distinguish Ki-67-positive and negative tumor cells. The dataset was augmented and divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) subsets. Among the YOLOv8 variants tested, the Medium model achieved the highest performance, with a mean Average Precision at 50% Intersection over Union (mAP50) exceeding 85% for Ki-67-positive cells. The proposed approach offers an efficient, scalable, and objective alternative to conventional scoring methods, supporting greater consistency in Ki-67 evaluation. Future directions include developing user-friendly clinical interfaces and expanding to multi-institutional datasets to enhance generalizability and facilitate broader adoption in diagnostic practice.</description>

      <title>IgCraft: A versatile sequence generation framework for antibody discovery and engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing antibody sequences to better resemble those observed in natural human repertoires is a key challenge in biologics development. We introduce IgCraft: a multi-purpose model for paired human antibody sequence generation, built on Bayesian Flow Networks. IgCraft presents one of the first unified generative modeling frameworks capable of addressing multiple antibody sequence design tasks with a single model, including unconditional sampling, sequence inpainting, inverse folding, and CDR motif scaffolding. Our approach achieves competitive results across the full spectrum of these tasks while constraining generation to the space of human antibody sequences, exhibiting particular strengths in CDR motif scaffolding (grafting) where we achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of humanness and preservation of structural properties. By integrating previously separate tasks into a single scalable generative model, IgCraft provides a versatile platform for sampling human antibody sequences under a variety of contexts relevant to antibody discovery and engineering. Model code and weights are publicly available at github.com/mgreenig/IgCraft.</description>

      <title>Phylo2Vec: a vector representation for binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12693v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary phylogenetic trees inferred from biological data are central to understanding the shared history among evolutionary units. However, inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree is computationally expensive. State-of-the-art methods rely on carefully designed heuristics for tree search, using different data structures for easy manipulation (e.g., classes in object-oriented programming languages) and readable representation of trees (e.g., Newick-format strings). Here, we present Phylo2Vec, a parsimonious encoding for phylogenetic trees that serves as a unified approach for both manipulating and representing phylogenetic trees. Phylo2Vec maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to a unique integer vector of length $n-1$. The advantages of Phylo2Vec are fourfold: i) fast tree sampling, (ii) compressed tree representation compared to a Newick string, iii) quick and unambiguous verification if two binary trees are identical topologically, and iv) systematic ability to traverse tree space in very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world datasets and show that a simple hill-climbing-based optimisation scheme can efficiently traverse the vastness of tree space from a random to an optimal tree.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions of a general stochastic velocity-jump model subject to discrete-time noisy observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension, characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model subject to noisy, discrete-time, observations, with no direct access to the agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures. These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for inference and model selection.</description>

      <title>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</description>
