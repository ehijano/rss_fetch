      <title>Cross-linked pair of polymer chains under strong tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two cross-linked polymer systems in the strong stretching regime. The first consists of two polymers sharing one endpoint, with the other two endpoints coupled by a harmonic potential. Within the weakly bending approximation, we analyze the tensile elastic response for freely jointed or wormlike chains; for the latter, the approximation applies either at large tension or at moderate tension with large persistence length (rodlike limit). We obtain analytic expressions for the force--extension relation and for the longitudinal and transverse mismatch of the cross-linked endpoints. In the thermodynamic limit, the cross-link does not affect the tensile elasticity, but it significantly suppresses transverse fluctuations, effectively forming a loop structure. The second system is a polymer necklace in the thermodynamic limit, composed of two strongly stretched polymers interconnected by a regular sequence of reversible cross-links. Using an analogy with a two-dimensional system of concatenated Gaussian loops ("Gaussian slinky"), we calculate the mean fraction of cross-linked sites as a function of the tensile force and find weak and strong binding regimes connected by a crossover. For shallow binding potential wells (compared with $k_{\rm{B}}T$), we employ a continuum description and exploit the mapping between directed polymers and a two-dimensional quantum particle to determine the crossover behavior and the mean transverse separation between the two polymer chains.</description>

      <title>Imprinting Macroscopic Fracture during Gelation: A Mechanism for Tuning Colloidal Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal gels form through the sol-gel transition of attractive particle suspensions, where local aggregation leads to a space-spanning network with solid-like properties. Their microstructure and mechanical properties are highly sensitive to external perturbations, which can substantially alter the pathway of network formation. Here, we investigate how nonlinear oscillatory shear affects the sol-gel transition of colloidal silica suspensions. Using large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS), we vary both the strain amplitude and the duration of oscillatory forcing, varying between one and two times the gelation time. We find that sufficiently large strain amplitudes, or prolonged exposure to oscillations in the nonlinear regime, alter irreversibly the gel properties: the storage modulus $G'$ decreases while its frequency dependence remains unchanged. In contrast, the loss modulus $G''$, which decreases monotonically with frequency under quiescent gelation, exhibits an upturn at high frequencies when the gel is formed under strong oscillatory shear. The viscoelastic spectra of gels formed under quiescent conditions are well captured by a fractional Maxwell model, while gels formed under LAOS require an additional fractional element to account for damage-induced dissipation. Rheo-imaging experiments corroborate this interpretation by revealing the growth of cracks in gels formed under LAOS. We further show that these gels display a progressively more ductile nonlinear response for prolonged exposure to LAOS during gelation. These results demonstrate that the interplay between non-linear shear and gelation can permanently imprint a macroscopic fracture pattern into colloidal gels, offering a route to tune their viscoelastic properties.</description>

      <title>Light-induced deformation of side-chain azo-polymer: Insights from atomistic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we apply, for the first time, the fully atomistic force field approach to modeling light-induced deformations of azo-polymers, thereby establishing a relationship between macroscopic parameters and the microscopic molecular architecture of the used azo-polymers. We apply an orientation potential to mimic the illumination of the sample, in which the action of light is represented through controlled redistribution of azo-chromophores relative to the polarization direction. This strategy allows us to capture both the microscopic details of chromophore behaviour and the collective, anisotropic response of the polymer matrix. By combining these complementary perspectives, the simulations not only resolve the local mechanism of light-induced motion but also provide a pathway to bridge molecular-scale dynamics with mesoscopic deformation phenomena in azo-polymer films.</description>

      <title>How elasticity affects bubble pinch-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinch-off of bubbles in viscoelastic liquids is a fundamental process that has received little attention compared to viscoelastic drop pinch-off. While these processes exhibit qualitative similarities, the dynamics of the pinch-off process are fundamentally different. When a drop of a dilute polymer solution pinches off, a thread is known to develop that prevents breakup due the diverging polymer stresses. Conversely, our experiments reveal that this thread is absent for bubble pinch-off in dilute polymer solutions. We show that a thread becomes apparent only for high polymer concentrations, where the pinch-off dynamics become very sensitive to the size of the needle from which the bubble detaches. The experiments are complemented by numerical simulations and analytical modeling using the Oldroyd-B model, which capture the dilute regime. The model shows that polymer stresses are still singular during bubble pinch-off, but the divergence is much weaker as compared to drop pinch-off. This explains why, in contrast to droplets, viscoelastic bubble-threads do not appear for dilute suspensions but require large polymer concentrations</description>

      <title>Comparing the Mechanical and Thermodynamic Definitions of Pressure in Ice Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal nucleation studies using hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones models have shown that the pressure within the nucleus is lower than that in the surrounding liquid. Here, we use the mechanical route to obtain it for an ice nucleus in supercooled water (TIP4P/Ice) at 1 bar and 247 K. From this (mechanical) pressure, we obtain the interfacial stress using a thermodynamic definition consistent with mechanical arguments. This pressure is compared with that of bulk ice at equal chemical potential (thermodynamic pressure), and the interfacial stress with the interfacial free energy. Furthermore, we investigate these properties on the basal plane. We find that, unlike in hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones systems, mechanical and thermodynamic pressures agree for the nucleus, and the interfacial stress and free energy are comparable. Yet the basal interface displays an interfacial stress nearly twice its interfacial free energy, suggesting that this agreement may be system dependent, underscoring the limitations of mechanical routes to solid-liquid interfacial free energies.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive rheological inference from stable flows in confined tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the in-plane rheology of epithelial monolayers remains challenging due to the difficulty of imposing controlled shear. We introduce a self-driven, rheometer-like assay in which collective migration generates stationary shear flows, allowing rheological parameters to be inferred directly from image sequences. The assay relies on two sets of ring-shaped fibronectin patches, micropatterned in arrays for high-throughput imaging. Within isolated rings, the epithelial tissue exhibits persistent rotation, from which we infer active migration stresses and substrate friction. Within partially overlapping rings, the tissue exhibits sustained shear, from which we infer the elastic and viscous responses of the cells. The emergence of a Maxwell-like viscoelastic relation --characterized by a linear relationship between mean cell deformation and neighbor-exchange rate-- is specifically recapitulated within a wet vertex-model framework, which reproduces experimental measurements only when intercellular viscous dissipation is included alongside substrate friction. We apply our method to discriminate the respective roles of two myosin~II isoforms in tissue mechanics. Overall, by harnessing self-generated stresses instead of externally imposed ones, we propose a noninvasive route to rheological inference in migrating epithelial tissues and, more generally, in actively flowing granular materials.</description>

      <title>X-ray Microscopy Study of Freezing Sessile Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sessile water droplet on a cold substrate freezes into a shape with a sharp apex because of water's expansion upon freezing, yielding a universal tip angle across various conditions. Using \textit{in situ} X-ray imaging, we report that this angle changes with substrate temperature, and the deviation originates from bubble formation during freezing. Three-dimensional tomography enables direct quantification of the effective ice-water density ratio, accounting for trapped bubbles. Incorporating this effective density ratio reconciles the temperature-dependent tip angles. We also confirm that a bubble-free frozen droplet in a vacuum chamber exhibits the universal tip angle. Furthermore, X-ray imaging allows us to measure the three-phase boundary angles \textit{in situ}, thereby validating the geometric theory behind tip formation. These findings advance our understanding of the freezing dynamics associated with multiphase systems and highlight the capabilities of high-resolution X-ray imaging in ice research.</description>

      <title>Effect of cohesion on the gravity-driven evacuation of metal powder through Triply-Periodic Minimal Surface structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evacuating the powder trapped inside the complex cavities of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures remains a major challenge in metal-powder-based additive manufacturing. The Discrete Element Method offers valuable insights into this evacuation process, enabling the design of effective de-powdering strategies. In this study, we simulate gravity-driven evacuation of trapped powders from inside unit cells of various TPMS structures. We systematically investigate the role of cohesive energy density in shaping the discharge profile. Overall, we conclude that the Schwarz-P and Gyroid topologies enable the most efficient powder evacuation, remaining resilient to cohesion-induced flow hindrance. Furthermore, for the two unit cells, we analyse detailed kinematics and interpret the results in relation to particle overlaps and contact force distributions.</description>

      <title>Simulating droplet adhesion on superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical model is proposed to simulate the adhesion, compression, and subsequent detachment of a micro-liter droplet from a superhydrophobic surface composed of chemically homogeneous pillars arranged in a periodic fashion, replicating a typical force probe microscopy experiment. We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates. The proposed method will be useful for the quantitative analysis and design of a variety of superhydrophobic surfaces and will pave the way for more accurate surface characterization based on droplet adhesion force measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing superhydrophobic surface topography using droplet adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces with microscopic structures is essential for designing materials with reduced drag, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and anti-fouling properties. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that forces on droplets receding over structured surfaces are governed by microscale deformations near the contact line. We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force. This newfound insight enables precise quantification of superhydrophobic surface structure using a droplet probe.</description>

      <title>A patchy-particle 3-dimensional octagonal quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise an ideal 3-dimensional octagonal quasicrystal that is based upon the 2-dimensional Ammann-Beenker tiling and that is potentially suitable for realization with patchy particles. Based on an analysis of its local environments we design a binary system of 8- and 5-patch particles that in simulations assembles into a 3-dimensional octagonal quasicrystal. The local structure is subtly different from the original ideal quasicrystal possessing a narrower coordination-number distribution; in fact, the 8-patch particles are not needed and a one-component system of the 5-patch particles assembles into an essentially identical octagonal quasicrystal. We also consider a one-component system of the 8-patch particles; this assembles into a cluster with a number of crystalline domains, but which, because of the coherent boundaries between the crystallites, has approximate eight-fold order. We envisage that these systems could be realized using DNA origami or protein design.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Cavitation with Surface Tension: New Insights into Failure of Particle Reinforced Polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and mitigating the failure of reinforced elastomers has been a long-standing challenge in many industrial applications. In an early attempt to shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of failure, Gent and Park presented a systematic experimental study examining the field that develops near rigid beads that are embedded in the material and describe two distinct failure phenomena: cavitation that occurs near the bead in the bulk of the material, and debonding at the bead--rubber interface [Gent, A.N. and Park, B., 1984. Journal of Materials Science, 19, pp.1947-1956]. Although the interpretation of their results has not been challenged, several questions stemming from their work remain unresolved. Specifically, the reported dependence of the cavitation stress on the diameter of the bead and the counterintuitive relationship between the delamination threshold and the material stiffness. In this work, we revisit the work of Gent and Park and consider an alternative explanation of their observations, interfacial cavitation. A numerically validated semi-analytical model shows that in {the} presence of surface tension, defects at the bead-rubber interface may be prone to cavitate at lower pressures compared to bulk cavitation, and that surface tension can explain the reported length-scale effects. A phase-map portrays the distinct regions of `cavitation dominated' and `delamination dominated' failure and confirms that for the expected range of material properties of the rubbers used by Gent and Park, interfacial cavitation is a likely explanation. Crucially, this result offers a new avenue to tune and optimize the performance of reinforced polymers and other multi-material systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Basis of Sugar-Dependent Polymer Stabilization: Informing Biologic Formulation Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stabilization of macromolecules is fundamental to developing biological formulations, such as vaccines and protein therapeutics. In this study, we employ coarse grained polymer models to investigate the impact of four sugars: $\alpha$-glucose, $\beta$-fructose, trehalose, and sucrose on macromolecule stability. Free energy decomposition and preferential interaction analysis indicate that polymer-sugar interactions favor folding at low concentrations while driving unfolding at higher concentrations. In contrast, the polymer-solvent soft interaction entropy consistently favors unfolding across all sugar concentrations under study. At low sugar concentrations, polymer-solvent interactions predominantly govern stabilization, whereas at higher concentrations, entropic penalties dictate polymer stability. Local mixing entropy demonstrates that binary sugar mixtures introduce entropic contributions that preferentially stabilize the folded state. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of sugar-based excipient stabilization mechanisms, offering guidance for the rational design of stable biological formulations.</description>

      <title>Linear Viscoelasticity of Semiflexible Polymers with Hydrodynamic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear viscoelastic response of single semiflexible polymer chains in the infinite-dilution limit is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations of coarse-grained bead-spring chains. The springs obey the FENE-Fraenkel force law, a bending potential is used to capture chain stiffness and hydrodynamic interactions are included through the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor. By calculating the relaxation modulus following a step strain, we demonstrate that the bead-spring chain behaves like an inextensible semiflexible rod over a wide time window with an appropriate choice of spring stiffness and chain extensibility. In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, our results agree with the existing theoretical predictions for the linear viscoelastic response of free-draining, inextensible, semiflexible rods in the limit of infinite dilution. It is shown that at intermediate times, the stress relaxation modulus exhibits power law behaviour, with the exponent ranging from $(-1/2)$ for flexible chains to $(-5/4)$ for highly rigid chains. At long times, rigid chains undergo orientational relaxation, while flexible chains exhibit Rouse relaxation. Hydrodynamic interactions are found to effect the behaviour at intermediate and long times, with the difference from free-draining behaviour increasing with increasing chain flexibility. Computations of the frequency dependence of loss and storage moduli are found to be in good agreement with experimental data for a wide variety of systems involving semiflexible polymers of varying stiffness across a broad frequency range.</description>

Abstract: We analytically investigate the dynamic behavior of an an-isotropic active Brownian particle under various stochastic resetting protocols in two dimensions. The motion of shape-asymmetric active Brownian particles in two dimensions leads to an-isotropic diffusion at short times, whereas rotational diffusion causes the transport to become isotropic at longer times. We have considered three different resetting protocols: (a) complete resetting, when both position and orientation are reset to their initial states, (b) only position is reset to its initial state, (c) only orientation is reset to its initial state. We reveal that orientation resetting sustains asymmetry even at late times. When both the spatial position and orientation are subject to resetting, a complex position probability distribution forms in the steady state. All the analytical findings are thoroughly validated by corresponding simulation results.</description>

      <title>Effects of Non-reciprocity on Coupled Kuramoto Oscillators</title>

Abstract: All the fundamental interactions (such as gravity or electromagnetic interactions) are reciprocal in nature. However, in the macroscopic world, in particular outside equilibrium, non-reciprocal or non-mutual interactions are quite ubiquitous. Understanding the impact of such non-reciprocal interactions has drawn a significant amount of interest in physics and other fields of sciences in recent years. We explore a non-reciprocal version of coupled oscillators (known as the Kuramoto model) with the aim of understanding the role of non-reciprocity, particularly in relation to chimera states, where oscillators spontaneously break into mutually synchronous and asynchronous groups. Our findings suggest that non-reciprocity not only alters the state diagram of the chimera state significantly but can also lead to new dynamical states, such as traveling chimera, run-and-chase and coexistence phases.</description>
