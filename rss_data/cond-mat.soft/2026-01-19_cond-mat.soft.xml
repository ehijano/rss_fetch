      <title>De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Self-Assembly of Crowded Semiflexible Polymers under Dynamic and Deformable Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiflexible polymers are ubiquitous in natural and artificial systems, where their intermediate rigidity gives rise to rich structural and dynamical behavior. Confinement plays a central role in these behaviors, as spatial restrictions can promote chain alignment, induce structural rearrangements, and enable complex self-assembly. While the organization of semiflexible polymers under rigid confinement has been extensively investigated, their behavior within deformable and dynamically evolving microenvironments, such as drying droplets or intracellular compartments, remains poorly understood. In this study, we use dissipative particle dynamics simulations to investigate the self-assembly of crowded semiflexible polymers confined within a deformable droplet, whose size may also change over time. By systematically varying polymer contour length, concentration, and degree of confinement, we identify distinct assembly regimes. Increasing polymer concentration promotes the formation of ordered fibrillar domains, with orientational alignment strongest near the droplet interface. Chain length critically dictates the morphology of assembled structures: short chains remain largely disordered, chains with intermediate lengths form linear fibrillar structures with maximal nematic order, and long chains assemble into circular bundles. Dynamic confinement further modulates the assembly through the competition between the rate of confinement change and polymer mobility. Slow increase in the degree of confinement allows polymers to reorganize into highly ordered structures, while rapid crowding kinetically traps the system in disordered states. Our findings elucidate how polymer mechanics and time-dependent confinement jointly govern the organization of semiflexible polymers in deformable, dynamic, and crowded environments.</description>

      <title>Implicit Nucleation and Competitive Dynamics of Electrogenerated Hydrogen Nanobubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrogenerated gas nanobubbles strongly influence the performance of electrochemical energy-conversion systems, yet their nucleation and early evolution remain poorly understood due to limitations of existing experimental and computational approaches. Operando imaging lacks the temporal resolution required to capture nucleation events, while molecular dynamics simulations are restricted to nanometer-scale domains containing at most a few bubbles. Here, we develop a thermodynamically consistent phase-field framework that unifies dissolved gas transport, curvature dependent interfacial thermodynamics, and implicit bubble nucleation within a single continuum description. Using hydrogen nanobubble formation during electrocatalysis as a canonical test case, the model captures nucleation without prescribing nuclei, resolves diffusion-controlled growth under curvature effects, and remains computationally tractable despite hydrogen's extremely low solubility. Simulations reveal how nanobubble nucleation occurs once a local supersaturation threshold is exceeded, triggering a reorganization of the chemical-potential field that focuses dissolved gas toward the nascent bubble. In multi-catalyst systems, overlapping diffusion fields lead to strong bubble-bubble interactions, including competitive growth, Ostwald ripening, and source occlusion. Extending the framework to dispersed catalyst populations shows that nanobubble survival is governed not only by catalyst size but also by spatial arrangement and diffusive competition, such that only a subset of bubbles persist while others dissolve and act as feeders. These results reframe electrogenerated nanobubbles as emergent, spatially organized features rather than unavoidable parasitic byproducts, and point toward electrode designs that deliberately control where bubbles nucleate and grow to preserve active area and mitigate transport losses.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Crosslinking and Deformation on Polymer Crystallization and Melting: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the crystallization of crosslinked and entangled polymers under external deformation using a coarse-grained poly(vinyl alcohol) (CG-PVA) model and molecular dynamics simulations. Following uniaxial deformation, the systems are cooled at a constant rate to form semi-crystalline states and subsequently heated at a constant rate to induce melting. For unstretched systems, network junctions do not significantly affect the nucleation temperature but increase the amorphous fraction and reduce the melting temperature. Uniaxial deformation accelerates nucleation and markedly increases the crystallization temperature, with more strongly crosslinked polymers exhibiting larger shifts that correlate with an enhanced orientation order parameter. We further compare cooling and heating cycles under constant-strain and constant-stress conditions. Under constant stress, crystallization induces additional elongation beyond the initial pre-stretch and leads to pronounced mechanical hysteresis upon heating, a behavior characteristic of reversible shape-memory materials.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium geometric forces steer spiral waves on folded surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral waves are ubiquitous signatures of non equilibrium dynamics, appearing across chemical, biological, and active systems. Yet, in many living systems these waves unfold on curved and folded surfaces whose geometry has rarely been treated as a dynamical factor. Here we show that surface curvature fundamentally shapes spiral wave behavior and can contribute to the organization of neural activity in the brain. Via analytical theory and simulations of the complex Ginzburg Landau equation (CGLE) on curved surfaces, we demonstrate that curvature enters through the Laplace Beltrami operator as a spatial modulation of effective diffusion. Gradients of this effective diffusion generate a geometric force on spiral defects, and the complex nature of the CGLE produces a complex mobility that leads to non central and non reciprocal responses. Applied to realistic cortical surfaces of the human brain, the model predicts that the pattern of cortical folding stabilizes and localizes spiral waves, while progressive smoothing of the surface erases these non equilibrium structures. This reveals that brain geometry is not a passive scaffold but an active physical constraint that shapes neural dynamics. More broadly, the same geometric mechanism provides a universal route by which curvature and topology control pattern formation across oscillatory, chemical, and active matter systems.</description>

      <title>NAVIS: A LAMMPS-Python framework for efficient computation of nanochannel velocity and thermal interfacial slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NAVIS (NAnochannel Velocity and thermal Interfacial Slip), a LAMMPS-Python scripted toolkit for computing the Navier (hydrodynamic) friction coefficient and Kapitza (thermal) resistance at arbitrary solid-fluid interfaces. NAVIS is based on equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) methods for calculating the linear response friction and thermal resistance at the interface, as well as the corresponding velocity and temperature slips. The methodology is based on our previous studies (Hansen, et al., Phys. Rev. E 84, 016313 (2011); Varghese et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 184707 (2021); Alosious, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 194502 (2019); Alosious, et al., Langmuir 37, 2355-2361 (2021)), and in this work we provide a pedagogical framework for the implementation of this toolkit on two systems: (i) a water-graphene system (for hydrodynamic slip) and (ii) a water-CNT system (for thermal slip). We provide detailed instructions for performing the EMD simulations using the LAMMPS package and processing the simulation outputs using Python modules to obtain the desired quantities of interest. We expect the toolkit to be useful for computational researchers studying interfacial friction and thermal transport, key factors for efficient and practical applications of nanofluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced motion of ciliates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time dynamics of flagellar and ciliary beating is often neglected in theories of microswimmers, with the most common models prescribing a time-constant actuation of the surrounding fluid. By explicitly introducing a metachronal wave, coarse-grained to a sinusoidal surface slip velocity, we show that a spatial resonance between the metachronal wave and the corrugation of a confining cylindrical channel enables a ciliate to swim even when it cannot move forward in a bulk fluid. Using lubrication theory, we reduce the problem to the Adler equation that reveals an oscillatory and ballistic swimming regime. Interestingly, a ciliate can even reverse its swimming direction in a corrugated channel compared to the bulk fluid.</description>

      <title>Supercritical Snapping and Controlled Launching via Dual Latch Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural organisms have evolved integrated Latch-Mediated Spring Actuation systems (LaMSA) that consist of multiple latches and springs to enhance power output and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. Similar designs are appealing yet largely unexplored in engineered materials due to the complexity of integrating multiple components into a single material platform. Here, we report a dual-latched magneto-elastic shell device capable of selectively activating the latches to regulate snapping pathways and energy output based on specific actuation requirements. Differential deswelling across the thickness acts as the motor to load the elastic energy into the shell, which is then released via the snap-through instability once the loading reaches the critical threshold, constituting an intrinsic mechanical latch. Activation of the external magnetic latch delays snapping onset beyond the threshold of the intrinsic latch, leading to a power-amplified supercritical snap-through instability as well as a bifurcation instability. The combined function of both latches allows for flexible control over energy storage and release. Additionally, this integrated LaMSA system possesses an untethered anchoring mechanism, enabling the device to launch in arbitrary directions from the substrate, driven by the energy released during snapping. We envision that the design principles of dual-latched LaMSA systems will create opportunities for power-dense actuation in engineered materials and robotic devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Real-Time Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins with Arrays of Biofunctionalized Graphene Field-Effect Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing interest in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) for biosensing applications, there is a strong demand for strategies enabling flexible and multiplexed biofunctionalization, as well as highly parallel, real-time electronic readout integrated with microfluidic control. Here we present a methodology that addresses these challenges by enabling real-time, parallel monitoring of multiple GFETs integrated on a single microfabricated chip within an automated electronic and microfluidic platform. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach through ultrasensitive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. GFET chips are functionalized via van der Waals assembly using 1 nm-thick molecular two-dimensional (2D) materials - carbon nanomembranes - which enable multiplexed biofunctionalization. The chips are integrated into a custom-developed microelectronic and microfluidic system that allows parallel, real-time, and automated measurements of 15 GFETs. We present in situ biofunctionalization of the GFETs with antibodies, followed by highly specific detection of the S- and N-proteins with limits of detection down to 10 aM and a dynamic range spanning four orders of magnitude. Owing to its versatility, the presented methodology is readily adaptable for sensing a wide range of biological and chemical targets.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Radiative Energy Transfer Enables Stable, Low-Threshold Lasing in Hybrid Quantum Dot-Nanoplatelet Supraparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising building blocks for optoelectronics due to their solution processability, spectral tunability, and ability to self-assemble into complex architectures. However, their use in lasing application remains limited by high working thresholds, rapid nonradiative losses from Auger recombination, and sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we report hybrid microscale supraparticles composed of core/shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) and CdSe/CdxZn1-xS nanoplatelets (NPLs), which overcome these limitations through efficient, cavity-mediated energy funneling and coupling. Broadband absorbing QDs rapidly transfer excitation to narrow emitting NPLs, enabling stable whispering gallery mode lasing with a low threshold of 0.35 mJ/cm2. These supraparticles retain optical performance after prolonged exposure to air, water, and continuous irradiation, offering practical advantages for optoelectronic devices and advanced pigment technologies. Ultimately, our approach provides a versatile, programmable platform for optical amplification and tunable emission control within colloidal photonic architectures. Keywords</description>

      <title>Principles of Client Enrichment in Multicomponent Biomolecular Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are commonly organized by a small number of scaffold molecules that drive phase separation together with client molecules that do not condense on their own but become selectively recruited into the dense phase. A central open question is how client recruitment feeds back on scaffold interactions to determine condensate composition. Here we address this problem in a reconstituted focal adhesion system composed of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated p130Cas (Cas) as scaffolds and the adaptor protein paxillin (PXN) as a client. We show that both FAK phosphorylation and PXN recruitment produce a common compositional response in which FAK becomes enriched while Cas is depleted within the condensate. To interpret these observations, we develop two complementary theoretical descriptions. First, within a two-component Flory-Huggins framework, we show that phosphorylation can be captured by either strengthening heterotypic FAK-Cas interactions or increasing the effective number of interaction-relevant segments on FAK, both of which bias partitioning toward FAK-rich condensates. Second, we introduce a minimal three-component Flory-Huggins theory without an explicit solvent and map it onto an effective two-component description, demonstrating that client recruitment renormalizes homotypic and heterotypic scaffold interactions. Analytical predictions for the location of the critical point are tested in reconstituted multicomponent systems through PXN addition, showing that client recruitment alone tunes proximity to criticality and reshapes condensate composition. Together, our results reveal distinct yet convergent physical routes by which post-translational modification and client recruitment control scaffold composition in multicomponent condensates.</description>

      <title>Entanglement complexity of spanning pairs of lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement complexity of a system consisting of two simple-closed curves (self-avoiding polygons) that span a lattice tube, referred to as a 2SAP. 2SAPs are of interest as the first known model of confined ring polymers where the linking probability goes to 1 exponentially with the size of the system. Atapour et al proved this in 2010 by showing that all but exponentially few sufficiently large 2SAPs contain a pattern that guarantees the 2SAP is non-split, provided that the requisite pattern fits in the tube. This result was recently extended to all tubes sizes that admit non-trivial links. Here we develop and apply knot theory results to answer more general questions about the entanglement complexity of 2SAPs.
  We first extend the 1992 concept of a good measure of knot complexity to a good measure, $F$, of spanning-link complexity for $k$-component links. Using tangle products, we show, for example, that the more complex the prime knot decomposition of any component of a given link type, the greater its $F$-measure. We then prove that all but exponentially few size $m$ 2SAPs have $F$ complexity that grows at least linearly in $m$ as $m\to \infty$. We establish that good measures of knot complexity yield good measures of spanning-link complexity. We also establish conditions whereby more general link invariants can yield good measures. In particular, we establish that measures based on several classical invariants are good measures by our definition, eg bridge number or the number of $p$-colourings.
  Finally, we consider how the tube dimensions affect which links are embeddable as 2SAPs as well as geometric restrictions on the entanglement complexity of the embeddings. For example, we establish that there are two-component links that occur as 2SAPs in a given tube size only when one of the components is forced into a non-minimal bridge number conformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curved elastic shells can be fabricated through molding or by harnessing residual stresses. These shells often exhibit snap-through behavior and multistability when loaded. We present a unique way of fabricating curved elastic shells that exhibit multistability and snap-through behavior, weft-knitting. The knitting process introduces internal stresses into the textile sheet, which leads to complex 3D curvatures. We explore the relationship between the geometry and the mechanical response, identifying a parameter space where the textiles are multistable. We harness the snapping behavior and shape change through multistability to design soft conductive switches with built-in haptic feedback, and incorporate these textile switches into wearable devices. This work will allow us to harness the nonlinear mechanical behavior of textiles to create functional, soft, and seamless wearable devices. This includes but is not limited to the devices for additional cycling visibility and safety that we envision.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between active matter and its environment is central to understanding emergent behavior in biological and synthetic systems. Here, we show that coupling active nematic flows to small-amplitude deformations of a compliant substrate can fundamentally reorganize the system's dynamics. Using a model that combines active nematohydrodynamics with substrate mechanics, we find that contractile active nematics-normally disordered in flat geometries-undergo a sharp transition to long-range orientational order when the environment is deformable. This environmentally induced ordering is robust and enables distinct patterning regimes, with wrinkle morphologies reflecting the nature of the active stresses. Our results reveal a generic mechanism by which mechanical feedback from soft environments can lead to ordering in active systems.</description>

      <title>A general model for frictional contacts in colloidal systems</title>

Abstract: In simulations of colloidal matter, frictional contacts between particles are often neglected. For spherical colloids, such an approximation can be problematic, since frictional contacts couple translational and rotational degrees of freedom, which may affect the collective behavior of, e.g., colloids under shear and chiral active matter. Deterministic models for frictional contacts have been proposed in the granular matter community. On the colloidal scale, however, thermal fluctuations are important and should be included in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Here, we derive the correct fluctuation-dissipation relation for linear and nonlinear instantaneous frictional contact interactions. Among other, this generates a new generalized class of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) thermostats with rotation-translation coupling. We demonstrate effects of frictional contact interactions using the examples of Poiseuille flow and motility induced phase separation in active Langevin particles.</description>

      <title>Self-induced buckling in hollow microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04247</link>

Abstract: Hollow microgels are elastic polymer shells easily realizable in experiments. Recent works have shown the emergence of buckling events in dilute hollow microgels under the effect of an added osmotic pressure. Here, we perform large-scale simulations to show that these microgels at high enough packing fractions undergo spontaneous symmetry-breaking deformations ranging from single large dents to multiple indentations, even in the absence of any externally applied stress. This self-induced buckling phenomenon is thus solely driven by interparticle crowding. We construct a phase diagram inspired by vesicle shape theories, mapping local curvature metrics as a function of the reduced volume, to quantify these findings, and we also propose ways to observe the occurrence of buckling in experiments. The present results thus rationalize the deformations occurring in suspensions of micro- and nano-scale elastic shells, offering a synthetic analogue to biological ones and allowing direct control on buckling instabilities for potential applications. Beyond materials design, these insights may also help to describe shape regulation in natural systems such as cells and vesicles, where similar deformations are observed.</description>

      <title>Structural and Dynamical Crossovers in Dense Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrostatic interactions fundamentally govern the structure and transport of electrolytes. In concentrated electrolytes, however, electrostatic and steric correlations, together with ion-solvent coupling, give rise to complex behavior, such as underscreening, that remains challenging to explain despite extensive theoretical effort. Using molecular dynamics simulations of primitive electrolytes with and without space-filling solvent particles, we elucidate the structural and dynamical crossovers and their connection that emerge with increasing salt concentration. Explicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition from a charge-dominated dilute regime to a density-dominated concentrated regime, accompanied by dynamical crossovers in ion self-diffusion and ion-pair lifetimes. These dynamical crossovers display a marked discontinuity, unlike the smoother variation of the screening crossover, which originates from short-range ion-counterion structures. The pronounced growth of ionic clusters leads to a percolation transition only at higher concentrations, whereas the onset of the structural and dynamical crossovers is associated primarily with local ion pairing or small aggregates. Both structural and dynamical behaviors are found to depend sensitively on ion-solvent coupling: implicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition between two charge-dominated regimes, accompanied by qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the diffusion-corrected ion-pair lifetime provides a consistent descriptor linking ionic structure and dynamics across electrolyte systems.</description>
