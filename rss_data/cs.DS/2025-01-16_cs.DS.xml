      <title>Efficient Shape Reconfiguration by Hybrid Programmable Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape formation is one of the most thoroughly studied problems in most algorithmic models of programmable matter. However, few existing shape formation algorithms utilize similarities between an initial configuration and a desired target shape. In the hybrid model, an active agent with the computational capabilities of a deterministic finite automaton can form shapes by lifting and placing passive tiles on the triangular lattice. We study the shape reconfiguration problem where the agent needs to move all tiles in an input shape to so-called target nodes, which are distinguishable from other nodes by the agent. We present a worst-case optimal $O(mn)$ algorithm for simply connected target shapes and an $O(n^4)$ algorithm for a large class of target shapes that may contain holes, where $m$ is the initial number of unoccupied target nodes and $n$ is the total number of tiles.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Approximation Schemes for Matching Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a continuous-time, infinite-horizon dynamic matching problem. Suppliers arrive according to a Poisson process; while waiting, they may abandon the queue at a uniform rate. Customers on the other side of the network must be matched upon arrival. The objective is to minimize the expected long-term average cost subject to a throughput constraint on the total match rate.
  Previous literature on dynamic matching focuses on "static" policies, where the matching decisions do not depend explicitly on the state of the supplier queues, achieving constant-factor approximations. By contrast, we design "adaptive" policies, which leverage queue length information, and obtain near-optimal polynomial-time algorithms for several classes of instances.
  First, we develop a bi-criteria Fully Polynomial-time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) for dynamic matching on networks with a constant number of queues -- that computes a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation of the optimal policy in time polynomial in both the input size and $1/\epsilon$. Using this algorithm as a subroutine, we obtain an FPTAS for dynamic matching on Euclidean networks of fixed dimension. A key new technique is a hybrid LP relaxation, which combines static and state-dependent LP approximations of the queue dynamics, after a decomposition of the network.
  Constant-size networks are motivated by deceased organ donation schemes, where the supply types can be divided according to blood and tissue types. The Euclidean case is of interest in ride-hailing and spatial service platforms, where the goal is to fulfill as many trips as possible while minimizing driving distances.</description>

      <title>Beating Competitive Ratio 4 for Graphic Matroid Secretary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the classic problems in online decision-making is the *secretary problem* where to goal is to maximize the probability of choosing the largest number from a randomly ordered sequence. A natural extension allows selecting multiple values under a combinatorial constraint. Babaioff, Immorlica, Kempe, and Kleinberg (SODA'07, JACM'18) introduced the *matroid secretary conjecture*, suggesting an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm exists for matroids. Many works since have attempted to obtain algorithms for both general matroids and specific classes of matroids. The ultimate goal is to obtain an $e$-competitive algorithm, and the *strong matroid secretary conjecture* states that this is possible for general matroids.
  A key class of matroids is the *graphic matroid*, where a set of graph edges is independent if it contains no cycle. The rich combinatorial structure of graphs makes them a natural first step towards solving a problem for general matroids. Babaioff et al. (SODA'07, JACM'18) first studied the graphic matroid setting, achieving a $16$-competitive algorithm. Subsequent works have improved the competitive ratio, most recently to 4 by Soto, Turkieltaub, and Verdugo (SODA'18).
  We break this $4$-competitive barrier, presenting a new algorithm with a competitive ratio of $3.95$. For simple graphs, we further improve this to $3.77$. Intuitively, solving the problem for simple graphs is easier since they lack length-two cycles. A natural question is whether a ratio arbitrarily close to $e$ can be achieved by assuming sufficiently large girth.
  We answer this affirmatively, showing a competitive ratio arbitrarily close to $e$ even for constant girth values, supporting the strong matroid secretary conjecture. We also prove this bound is tight: for any constant $g$, no algorithm can achieve a ratio better than $e$ even when the graph has girth at least $g$.</description>

      <title>A Refreshment Stirred, Not Shaken (II): Invariant-Preserving Deployments of Differential Privacy for the US Decennial Census</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the lens of the system of differential privacy specifications developed in Part I of a trio of articles, this second paper examines two statistical disclosure control (SDC) methods for the United States Decennial Census: the Permutation Swapping Algorithm (PSA), which is similar to the 2010 Census's disclosure avoidance system (DAS), and the TopDown Algorithm (TDA), which was used in the 2020 DAS. To varying degrees, both methods leave unaltered some statistics of the confidential data $\unicode{x2013}$ which are called the method's invariants $\unicode{x2013}$ and hence neither can be readily reconciled with differential privacy (DP), at least as it was originally conceived. Nevertheless, we establish that the PSA satisfies $\varepsilon$-DP subject to the invariants it necessarily induces, thereby showing that this traditional SDC method can in fact still be understood within our more-general system of DP specifications. By a similar modification to $\rho$-zero concentrated DP, we also provide a DP specification for the TDA. Finally, as a point of comparison, we consider the counterfactual scenario in which the PSA was adopted for the 2020 Census, resulting in a reduction in the nominal privacy loss, but at the cost of releasing many more invariants. Therefore, while our results explicate the mathematical guarantees of SDC provided by the PSA, the TDA and the 2020 DAS in general, care must be taken in their translation to actual privacy protection $\unicode{x2013}$ just as is the case for any DP deployment.</description>

      <title>Quantum collision circuit, quantum invariants and quantum phase estimation procedure for fluid dynamic lattice gas automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice Gas Cellular Automata (LGCA) is a classical numerical method widely known and applied to simulate several physical phenomena. In this paper, we study the translation of LGCA on quantum computers (QC) using computational basis encoding (CBE), developing methods for different purposes. In particular, we clarify and discuss some fundamental limitations and advantages in using CBE and quantum walk as streaming procedure. Using quantum walks affect the possible encoding of classical states in quantum orthogonal states, feature linked to the unitarity of collision and to the possibility of getting a quantum advantage. Then, we give efficient procedures for optimizing collisional quantum circuits, based on the classical features of the model. This is applied specifically to fluid dynamic LGCA. Alongside, a new collision circuit for a 1-dimensional model is proposed. We address the important point of invariants in LGCA providing a method for finding how many invariants appear in their QC formulation. Quantum invariants outnumber the classical expectations, proving the necessity of further research. Lastly, we prove the validity of a method for retrieving any quantity of interest based on quantum phase estimation (QPE).</description>

      <title>Equilibria in multiagent online problems with predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a multiagent setting. To this goal, we introduce a multiagent version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no extra cost.
  We investigate the effect of using predictors for self and others' behavior in such a setting, as well as the new equilibria formed in this way.</description>

      <title>Improved Algorithms for Contextual Dynamic Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contextual dynamic pricing, a seller sequentially prices goods based on contextual information. Buyers will purchase products only if the prices are below their valuations. The goal of the seller is to design a pricing strategy that collects as much revenue as possible. We focus on two different valuation models. The first assumes that valuations linearly depend on the context and are further distorted by noise. Under minor regularity assumptions, our algorithm achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, improving the existing results. The second model removes the linearity assumption, requiring only that the expected buyer valuation is $\beta$-H\"older in the context. For this model, our algorithm obtains a regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{d+2\beta/d+3\beta})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the context space.</description>

      <title>Extended convexity and smoothness and their applications in deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an optimization framework aimed at providing a theoretical foundation for a class of composite optimization problems, particularly those encountered in deep learning. In this framework, we introduce $\mathcal{H}(\phi)$-convexity and $\mathcal{H}(\Phi)$-smoothness to generalize the existing concepts of Lipschitz smoothness and strong convexity. Furthermore, we analyze and establish the convergence of both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent methods for objective functions that are $\mathcal{H}(\Phi)$-smooth. We prove that the optimal convergence rates of these methods depend solely on the homogeneous degree of $\Phi$. Based on these findings, we construct two types of non-convex and non-smooth optimization problems: deterministic composite and stochastic composite optimization problems, which encompass the majority of optimization problems in deep learning. To address these problems, we develop the gradient structure control algorithm and prove that it can locate approximate global optima. This marks a significant departure from traditional non-convex analysis framework, which typically settle for stationary points. Therefore, with the introduction of $\mathcal{H}(\phi)$-convexity and $\mathcal{H}(\Phi)$-smoothness, along with the GSC algorithm, the non-convex optimization mechanisms in deep learning can be theoretically explained and supported. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is substantiated through empirical experimentation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear functions of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient estimation of nonlinear functions of quantum states is crucial for various key tasks in quantum computing, such as entanglement spectroscopy, fidelity estimation, and feature analysis of quantum data. Conventional methods using state tomography and estimating numerous terms of the series expansion are computationally expensive, while alternative approaches based on a purified query oracle impose practical constraints. In this paper, we introduce the quantum state function (QSF) framework by extending the SWAP test via linear combination of unitaries and parameterized quantum circuits. Our framework enables the implementation of arbitrary degree-$n$ polynomial functions of quantum states with precision $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ copies. We further apply QSF for developing quantum algorithms of fundamental tasks, achieving a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/(\varepsilon^2\kappa))$ for both von Neumann entropy estimation and quantum state fidelity calculations, where $\kappa$ represents the minimal nonzero eigenvalue. Our work establishes a concise and unified paradigm for estimating and realizing nonlinear functions of quantum states, paving the way for the practical processing and analysis of quantum data.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Controlling Amendment and Successive Winners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The successive and the amendment procedures have been widely employed in parliamentary and legislative decision making and have undergone extensive study in the literature from various perspectives. However, investigating them through the lens of computational complexity theory has not been as thoroughly conducted as for many other prevalent voting procedures heretofore. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one paper which explores the complexity of several strategic voting problems under these two procedures, prior to our current work. To provide a better understanding of to what extent the two procedures resist strategic behavior, we study the parameterized complexity of constructive/destructive control by adding/deleting voters/candidates for both procedures. To enhance the generalizability of our results, we also examine a more generalized form of the amendment procedure. Our exploration yields a comprehensive (parameterized) complexity landscape of these problems with respect to numerous parameters.</description>
