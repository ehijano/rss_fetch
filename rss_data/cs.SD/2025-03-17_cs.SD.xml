      <title>Expressive Music Data Processing and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Musical expressivity and coherence are indispensable in music composition and performance, while often neglected in modern AI generative models. In this work, we introduce a listening-based data-processing technique that captures the expressivity in musical performance. This technique derived from Weber's law reflects the human perceptual truth of listening and preserves musical subtlety and expressivity in the training input. To facilitate musical coherence, we model the output interdependencies among multiple arguments in the music data such as pitch, duration, velocity, etc. in the neural networks based on the probabilistic chain rule. In practice, we decompose the multi-output sequential model into single-output submodels and condition previously sampled outputs on the subsequent submodels to induce conditional distributions. Finally, to select eligible sequences from all generations, a tentative measure based on the output entropy was proposed. The entropy sequence is set as a criterion to select predictable and stable generations, which is further studied under the context of informational aesthetic measures to quantify musical pleasure and information gain along the music tendency.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Analysis of Music Intervals and Tuning Systems in Oral Traditions Using Pitch Histograms: A Case Study of Iranian Vocal Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a computational methodology for analyzing music intervals and tunings in microtonal oral traditions, utilizing pitch histograms, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and optimization techniques. By extracting pitch frequencies directly from vocal performances and aligning them with MIDI notes via DTW, we determine musical intervals using histograms. This approach offers an efficient, performance-based, and instrument-independent alternative to traditional tuning system analysis. Optimization techniques are then employed to align intervals throughout the oral tradition repertoire, capturing the specific tunings and modes involved. Our methodology demonstrates the potential of computational techniques in advancing musicological and ethnomusicological research, revealing new insights into the studied traditions.</description>

      <title>Prosody-Enhanced Acoustic Pre-training and Acoustic-Disentangled Prosody Adapting for Movie Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movie dubbing describes the process of transforming a script into speech that aligns temporally and emotionally with a given movie clip while exemplifying the speaker's voice demonstrated in a short reference audio clip. This task demands the model bridge character performances and complicated prosody structures to build a high-quality video-synchronized dubbing track. The limited scale of movie dubbing datasets, along with the background noise inherent in audio data, hinder the acoustic modeling performance of trained models. To address these issues, we propose an acoustic-prosody disentangled two-stage method to achieve high-quality dubbing generation with precise prosody alignment. First, we propose a prosody-enhanced acoustic pre-training to develop robust acoustic modeling capabilities. Then, we freeze the pre-trained acoustic system and design a disentangled framework to model prosodic text features and dubbing style while maintaining acoustic quality. Additionally, we incorporate an in-domain emotion analysis module to reduce the impact of visual domain shifts across different movies, thereby enhancing emotion-prosody alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art models on two primary benchmarks. The demos are available at https://zzdoog.github.io/ProDubber/.</description>

      <title>Universal Speech Token Learning via Low-Bitrate Neural Codec and Pretrained Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large speech language models are mainly based on semantic tokens from discretization of self-supervised learned representations and acoustic tokens from a neural codec, following a semantic-modeling and acoustic-synthesis paradigm. However, semantic tokens discard paralinguistic attributes of speakers that is important for natural spoken communication, while prompt-based acoustic synthesis from semantic tokens has limits in recovering paralinguistic details and suffers from robustness issues, especially when there are domain gaps between the prompt and the target. This paper unifies two types of tokens and proposes the UniCodec, a universal speech token learning that encapsulates all semantics of speech, including linguistic and paralinguistic information, into a compact and semantically-disentangled unified token. Such a unified token can not only benefit speech language models in understanding with paralinguistic hints but also help speech generation with high-quality output. A low-bitrate neural codec is leveraged to learn such disentangled discrete representations at global and local scales, with knowledge distilled from self-supervised learned features. Extensive evaluations on multilingual datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in generating natural, expressive and long-term consistent output quality with paralinguistic attributes well preserved in several speech processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Serenade: A Singing Style Conversion Framework Based On Audio Infilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Serenade, a novel framework for the singing style conversion (SSC) task. Although singer identity conversion has made great strides in the previous years, converting the singing style of a singer has been an unexplored research area. We find three main challenges in SSC: modeling the target style, disentangling source style, and retaining the source melody. To model the target singing style, we use an audio infilling task by predicting a masked segment of the target mel-spectrogram with a flow-matching model using the complement of the masked target mel-spectrogram along with disentangled acoustic features. On the other hand, to disentangle the source singing style, we use a cyclic training approach, where we use synthetic converted samples as source inputs and reconstruct the original source mel-spectrogram as a target. Finally, to retain the source melody better, we investigate a post-processing module using a source-filter-based vocoder and resynthesize the converted waveforms using the original F0 patterns. Our results showed that the Serenade framework can handle generalized SSC tasks with the best overall similarity score, especially in modeling breathy and mixed singing styles. Moreover, although resynthesizing with the original F0 patterns alleviated out-of-tune singing and improved naturalness, we found a slight tradeoff in similarity due to not changing the F0 patterns into the target style.</description>

      <title>A General Close-loop Predictive Coding Framework for Auditory Working Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory working memory is essential for various daily activities, such as language acquisition, conversation. It involves the temporary storage and manipulation of information that is no longer present in the environment. While extensively studied in neuroscience and cognitive science, research on its modeling within neural networks remains limited. To address this gap, we propose a general framework based on a close-loop predictive coding paradigm to perform short auditory signal memory tasks. The framework is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets for environmental sound and speech, demonstrating high semantic similarity across both datasets.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Two-Step Training Scheme for Domain Invariant Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech separation seeks to isolate individual speech signals from a multi-talk speech mixture. Despite much progress, a system well-trained on synthetic data often experiences performance degradation on out-of-domain data, such as real-world speech mixtures. To address this, we introduce a novel context-aware, two-stage training scheme for speech separation models. In this training scheme, the conventional end-to-end architecture is replaced with a framework that contains a context extractor and a segregator. The two modules are trained step by step to simulate the speech separation process of an auditory system. We evaluate the proposed training scheme through cross-domain experiments on both synthetic and real-world speech mixtures, and demonstrate that our new scheme effectively boosts separation quality across different domains without adaptation, as measured by signal quality metrics and word error rate (WER). Additionally, an ablation study on the real test set highlights that the context information, including phoneme and word representations from pretrained SSL models, serves as effective domain invariant training targets for separation models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Derivation and Elimination: Audio Visual Segmentation with Enhanced Audio Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound-guided object segmentation has drawn considerable attention for its potential to enhance multimodal perception. Previous methods primarily focus on developing advanced architectures to facilitate effective audio-visual interactions, without fully addressing the inherent challenges posed by audio natures, \emph{\ie}, (1) feature confusion due to the overlapping nature of audio signals, and (2) audio-visual matching difficulty from the varied sounds produced by the same object. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Derivation and Elimination (DDESeg): a novel audio-visual segmentation framework. Specifically, to mitigate feature confusion, DDESeg reconstructs the semantic content of the mixed audio signal by enriching the distinct semantic information of each individual source, deriving representations that preserve the unique characteristics of each sound. To reduce the matching difficulty, we introduce a discriminative feature learning module, which enhances the semantic distinctiveness of generated audio representations. Considering that not all derived audio representations directly correspond to visual features (e.g., off-screen sounds), we propose a dynamic elimination module to filter out non-matching elements. This module facilitates targeted interaction between sounding regions and relevant audio semantics. By scoring the interacted features, we identify and filter out irrelevant audio information, ensuring accurate audio-visual alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in AVS datasets.</description>

      <title>Robust Audio-Visual Segmentation via Audio-Guided Visual Convergent Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately localizing audible objects based on audio-visual cues is the core objective of audio-visual segmentation. Most previous methods emphasize spatial or temporal multi-modal modeling, yet overlook challenges from ambiguous audio-visual correspondences such as nearby visually similar but acoustically different objects and frequent shifts in objects' sounding status. Consequently, they may struggle to reliably correlate audio and visual cues, leading to over- or under-segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework with two primary components: an audio-guided modality alignment (AMA) module and an uncertainty estimation (UE) module. Instead of indiscriminately correlating audio-visual cues through a global attention mechanism, AMA performs audio-visual interactions within multiple groups and consolidates group features into compact representations based on their responsiveness to audio cues, effectively directing the model's attention to audio-relevant areas. Leveraging contrastive learning, AMA further distinguishes sounding regions from silent areas by treating features with strong audio responses as positive samples and weaker responses as negatives. Additionally, UE integrates spatial and temporal information to identify high-uncertainty regions caused by frequent changes in sound state, reducing prediction errors by lowering confidence in these areas. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios where traditional approaches struggle to maintain reliable segmentation.</description>

      <title>DiffGAP: A Lightweight Diffusion Module in Contrastive Space for Bridging Cross-Model Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works in cross-modal understanding and generation, notably through models like CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) and CAVP (Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining), have significantly enhanced the alignment of text, video, and audio embeddings via a single contrastive loss. However, these methods often overlook the bidirectional interactions and inherent noises present in each modality, which can crucially impact the quality and efficacy of cross-modal integration. To address this limitation, we introduce DiffGAP, a novel approach incorporating a lightweight generative module within the contrastive space. Specifically, our DiffGAP employs a bidirectional diffusion process tailored to bridge the cross-modal gap more effectively. This involves a denoising process on text and video embeddings conditioned on audio embeddings and vice versa, thus facilitating a more nuanced and robust cross-modal interaction. Our experimental results on VGGSound and AudioCaps datasets demonstrate that DiffGAP significantly improves performance in video/text-audio generation and retrieval tasks, confirming its effectiveness in enhancing cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Handling Weak Complementary Relationships for Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition has recently drawn a lot of interest in affective computing as it has immense potential to outperform isolated unimodal approaches. Audio and visual modalities are two predominant contact-free channels in videos, which are often expected to carry a complementary relationship with each other. However, audio and visual channels may not always be complementary with each other, resulting in poor audio-visual feature representations, thereby degrading the performance of the system. In this paper, we propose a flexible audio-visual fusion model that can adapt to weak complementary relationships using a gated attention mechanism. Specifically, we extend the recursive joint cross-attention model by introducing gating mechanism in every iteration to control the flow of information between the input features and the attended features depending on the strength of their complementary relationship. For instance, if the modalities exhibit strong complementary relationships, the gating mechanism chooses cross-attended features, otherwise non-attended features. To further improve the performance of the system, we further introduce stage gating mechanism, which is used to control the flow of information across the gated outputs of each iteration. Therefore, the proposed model improves the performance of the system even when the audio and visual modalities do not have a strong complementary relationship with each other by adding more flexibility to the recursive joint cross attention mechanism. The proposed model has been evaluated on the challenging Affwild2 dataset and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion approaches.</description>

      <title>AV-Surf: Surface-Enhanced Geometry-Aware Novel-View Acoustic Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling sound propagation with complex real-world environments is essential for Novel View Acoustic Synthesis (NVAS). While previous studies have leveraged visual perception to estimate spatial acoustics, the combined use of surface normal and structural details from 3D representations in acoustic modeling has been underexplored. Given their direct impact on sound wave reflections and propagation, surface normals should be jointly modeled with structural details to achieve accurate spatial acoustics. In this paper, we propose a surface-enhanced geometry-aware approach for NVAS to improve spatial acoustic modeling. To achieve this, we exploit geometric priors, such as image, depth map, surface normals, and point clouds obtained using a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based framework. We introduce a dual cross-attention-based transformer integrating geometrical constraints into frequency query to understand the surroundings of the emitter. Additionally, we design a ConvNeXt-based spectral features processing network called Spectral Refinement Network (SRN) to synthesize realistic binaural audio. Experimental results on the RWAVS and SoundSpace datasets highlight the necessity of our approach, as it surpasses existing methods in novel view acoustic synthesis.</description>

      <title>AV-GS: Learning Material and Geometry Aware Priors for Novel View Acoustic Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) aims to render binaural audio at any target viewpoint, given a mono audio emitted by a sound source at a 3D scene. Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.</description>

      <title>Sequential Contrastive Audio-Visual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful technique in audio-visual representation learning, leveraging the natural co-occurrence of audio and visual modalities in webscale video datasets. However, conventional contrastive audio-visual learning (CAV) methodologies often rely on aggregated representations derived through temporal aggregation, neglecting the intrinsic sequential nature of the data. This oversight raises concerns regarding the ability of standard approaches to capture and utilize fine-grained information within sequences. In response to this limitation, we propose sequential contrastive audiovisual learning (SCAV), which contrasts examples based on their non-aggregated representation space using multidimensional sequential distances. Audio-visual retrieval experiments with the VGGSound and Music datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAV, with up to 3.5x relative improvements in recall against traditional aggregation-based contrastive learning and other previously proposed methods, which utilize more parameters and data. We also show that models trained with SCAV exhibit a significant degree of flexibility regarding the metric employed for retrieval, allowing us to use a hybrid retrieval approach that is both effective and efficient.</description>

      <title>PDMX: A Large-Scale Public Domain MusicXML Dataset for Symbolic Music Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent explosion of generative AI-Music systems has raised numerous concerns over data copyright, licensing music from musicians, and the conflict between open-source AI and large prestige companies. Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data. To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores. Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality. Examples can be found at https://pnlong.github.io/PDMX.demo/.</description>

      <title>AAD-LLM: Neural Attention-Driven Auditory Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning: A Case Study on Audio Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.

      <title>Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction using Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotions are an essential element in verbal communication, so understanding individuals' affect during a human-robot interaction (HRI) becomes imperative. This paper investigates the application of vision transformer models, namely ViT (Vision Transformers) and BEiT (BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers) pipelines, for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) in HRI. The focus is to generalize the SER models for individual speech characteristics by fine-tuning these models on benchmark datasets and exploiting ensemble methods. For this purpose, we collected audio data from different human subjects having pseudo-naturalistic conversations with the NAO robot. We then fine-tuned our ViT and BEiT-based models and tested these models on unseen speech samples from the participants. In the results, we show that fine-tuning vision transformers on benchmark datasets and and then using either these already fine-tuned models or ensembling ViT/BEiT models gets us the highest classification accuracies per individual when it comes to identifying four primary emotions from their speech: neutral, happy, sad, and angry, as compared to fine-tuning vanilla-ViTs or BEiTs.</description>

      <title>SPES: Spectrogram Perturbation for Explainable Speech-to-Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spurred by the demand for interpretable models, research on eXplainable AI for language technologies has experienced significant growth, with feature attribution methods emerging as a cornerstone of this progress. While prior work in NLP explored such methods for classification tasks and textual applications, explainability intersecting generation and speech is lagging, with existing techniques failing to account for the autoregressive nature of state-of-the-art models and to provide fine-grained, phonetically meaningful explanations. We address this gap by introducing Spectrogram Perturbation for Explainable Speech-to-text Generation (SPES), a feature attribution technique applicable to sequence generation tasks with autoregressive models. SPES provides explanations for each predicted token based on both the input spectrogram and the previously generated tokens. Extensive evaluation on speech recognition and translation demonstrates that SPES generates explanations that are faithful and plausible to humans.</description>

      <title>Video-Guided Foley Sound Generation with Multimodal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating sound effects for videos often requires creating artistic sound effects that diverge significantly from real-life sources and flexible control in the sound design. To address this problem, we introduce MultiFoley, a model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports multimodal conditioning through text, audio, and video. Given a silent video and a text prompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels spinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's roar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference audio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A key novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video datasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling high-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated evaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully generates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and outperforms existing methods.

      <title>LAVCap: LLM-based Audio-Visual Captioning using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated audio captioning is a task that generates textual descriptions for audio content, and recent studies have explored using visual information to enhance captioning quality. However, current methods often fail to effectively fuse audio and visual data, missing important semantic cues from each modality. To address this, we introduce LAVCap, a large language model (LLM)-based audio-visual captioning framework that effectively integrates visual information with audio to improve audio captioning performance. LAVCap employs an optimal transport-based alignment loss to bridge the modality gap between audio and visual features, enabling more effective semantic extraction. Additionally, we propose an optimal transport attention module that enhances audio-visual fusion using an optimal transport assignment map. Combined with the optimal training strategy, experimental results demonstrate that each component of our framework is effective. LAVCap outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the AudioCaps dataset, without relying on large datasets or post-processing.
