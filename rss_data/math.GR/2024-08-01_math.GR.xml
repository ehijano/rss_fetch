      <title>A Group Theory Proof of Pascal's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It will be shown that Pascal's Theorem is equivalent to the associativity of a natural binary operation on conic sections. A novel proof for Pascal's Theorem will then be given by showing that this binary operation is associative independent of Pascal's Theorem. Specifically, this operation is equivalent to either addition of real numbers, multiplication of real numbers, or rotations on the plane depending on the type of the conic. Since each of these is already known to be associative, it will follow that the binary operation is associative and this will prove Pascal's Theorem.</description>

      <title>The Aldous--Lyons Conjecture I: Subgroup Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, and its companion [BCV24], are devoted to a negative resolution of the Aldous--Lyons Conjecture [AL07, Ald07]. This conjecture, originated in probability theory, is well known (cf. [Gel18]) to be equivalent to the statement that every invariant random subgroup of the free group is co-sofic. We disprove this last statement.
  In this part we introduce subgroup tests. These tests are finite distributions over continuous functions from the space of subgroups of the free group to $\{0,1\}$. Subgroup tests provide a general framework in which one can study invariant random subgroups of the free group. Classical notions such as group soficity and group stability arise naturally in this framework. By the correspondence between subgroups of the free group and Schreier graphs, one can view subgroup tests as a property testing model for certain edge-labeled graphs. This correspondence also provides the connection to random networks.
  Subgroup tests have values, which are their asymptotic optimal expectations when integrated against co-sofic invariant random subgroups. Our first main result is that, if every invariant random subgroup of the free group is co-sofic, then one can approximate the value of a subgroup test up to any positive additive constant. Our second main result is an essentially value preserving correspondence between certain non-local games and subgroup tests. By composing this correspondence with a stronger variant of the reduction in MIP*=RE [JNV+21], proved in the companion paper [BCV24], we deduce that approximating the sofic value of a subgroup test is as hard as the Halting Problem, and in particular, undecidable. The combination of our two main results proves the existence of non co-sofic invariant random subgroups of the free group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any partial ascending HNN extension of a free group embeds in an actual ascending HNN extension of a free group. Moreover, we can ensure that it embeds as the parabolic subgroup of a relatively hyperbolic group.</description>

      <title>A general dynamical theory of Schwarz reflections, B-involutions, and algebraic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study matings of (anti-)polynomials and Fuchsian, reflection groups as Schwarz reflections, B-involutions or as (anti-)holomorphic correspondences, as well as their parameter spaces. We prove the existence of matings of generic (anti-)polynomials, such as periodically repelling, or geometrically finite (anti-)polynomials, with circle maps arising from the corresponding groups. These matings emerge naturally as degenerate (anti-)polynomial-like maps, and we show that the corresponding parameter space slices for such matings bear strong resemblance with parameter spaces of polynomial maps. Furthermore, we provide algebraic descriptions for these matings, and construct algebraic correspondences that combine generic (anti-)polynomials and genus zero orbifolds in a common dynamical plane, providing a new concrete evidence to Fatou's vision of a unified theory of groups and maps.</description>

      <title>A Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge for Subgroup Distance Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel zero-knowledge identification scheme based on the hardness of the subgroup distance problem in the Hamming metric. The proposed protocol, named Subgroup Distance Zero Knowledge Proof (SDZKP), employs a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator to mask secrets and utilizes a Stern-type algorithm to ensure robust security properties.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of $*$-algebras of non-Hausdorff $\mathbb{Z}_2$-multispinal groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study simplicity of $C^*$-algebras arising from self-similar groups of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-multispinal type, a generalization of the Grigorchuk case whose simplicity was first proved by L. Clark, R. Exel, E. Pardo, C. Starling, and A. Sims in 2019, and we prove results generalizing theirs. Our first main result is a sufficient condition for simplicity of the Steinberg algebra satisfying conditions modeled on the behavior of the groupoid associated to the first Grigorchuk group. This closely resembles conditions found by B. Steinberg and N. Szak\'acs. As a key ingredient we identify an infinite family of $2-(2q-1,q-1,q/2-1)$-designs, where $q$ is a positive even integer. We then deduce the simplicity of the associated $C^*$-algebra, which is our second main result. Results of similar type were considered by B. Steinberg and N. Szak\'acs in 2021, and later by K. Yoshida, but their methods did not follow the original methods of the five authors.</description>

      <title>Counting pseudo-Anosovs as weakly contracting isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a finite generating set of the mapping class group of a finite-type hyperbolic surface. We show that mapping classes supported on a fixed subsurface are not generic in the word metric with respect to $S$. We also show that pseudo-Anosov mapping classes are generic in the word metric with respect to $S'$, where $S'$ is $S$ plus a single mapping class. We also observe the analogous results for well-behaved hierarchically hyperbolic groups and groups quasi-isometric to them. This gives a version of quasi-isometry invariant theory of counting group elements in groups.</description>

      <title>Maximal subgroups of a family of iterated monodromy groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Basilica group is a well-known 2-generated weakly branch, but not branch, group acting on the binary rooted tree. Recently a more general form of the Basilica group has been investigated by Petschick and Rajeev, which is an $s$-generated weakly branch, but not branch, group that acts on the $m$-adic tree, for $s,m &gt; 1$. A larger family of groups, which contains these generalised Basilica groups, is the family of iterated monodromy groups. With the new developments by Francoeur, the study of the existence of maximal subgroups of infinite index has been extended from branch groups to weakly branch groups. Here we show that a subfamily of iterated monodromy groups, which more closely resemble the generalised Basilica groups, have maximal subgroups only of finite index.</description>

      <title>Cartan projections of fiber products and non quasi-isometric embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group and $N$ be a normal subgroup of $\Gamma$. The fiber product of $\Gamma$ with respect to $N$ is the subgroup $\Gamma \times_N \Gamma=\{(\gamma, \gamma w): \gamma \in \Gamma, w \in N\}$ of the direct product $\Gamma \times \Gamma$. For every representation $\rho:\Gamma \times_N \Gamma \rightarrow \mathsf{GL}_d(k)$, where $k$ is a local field, we establish upper bounds for the norm of the Cartan projection of $\rho$ in terms of a fixed word length function on $\Gamma$. As an application, we exhibit examples of finitely generated and finitely presented fiber products $P=\Gamma \times_N \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is linear and Gromov hyperbolic, such that $P$ does not admit linear representations which are quasi-isometric embeddings.</description>

      <title>Determining hypercentral Hall subgroups in finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\pi$ be a set of primes. The aim of this paper is to obtain some results concerning how much information about the $\pi$-structure of $G$ can be gathered from the knowledge of the lengths of conjugacy classes of its $\pi$-elements and of their multiplicities. Among other results, we prove that this multiset of class lengths determine whether $G$ has a hypercentral Hall $\pi$-subgroup.</description>

      <title>Weight 2 cohomology of graph complexes of cyclic operads and the handlebody group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the weight 2 cohomology of the Feynman transforms of the cyclic (co)operads $\mathsf{BV}$ and $\mathsf{HyCom}$, and the top$-2$ weight cohomology of the Feynman transforms of $D\mathsf{BV}$ and $\mathsf{Grav}$. Using a result of Giansiracusa, we compute, in particular, the top$-2$ weight cohomology of the handlebody group. We compare the result to the top$-2$ weight cohomology of the moduli space of curves $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$, recently computed by Payne and the last-named author. We also provide another proof of a recent result of Hainaut-Petersen identifying the top weight cohomology of the handlebody group with the Kontsevich graph cohomology.</description>

      <title>Top-degree rational cohomology in the symplectic group of a number ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $R = \mathcal{O}_K$. We show that if $R$ is not a principal ideal domain, then the symplectic group $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(R)$ has non-trivial rational cohomology in its virtual cohomological dimension. This demonstrates a sharp contrast to the situation where $R$ is Euclidean. To prove our result, we study the symplectic Steinberg module, i.e. the top-dimensional homology group of the spherical building associated to $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(K)$. We show that this module is not generated by integral apartment classes.</description>
