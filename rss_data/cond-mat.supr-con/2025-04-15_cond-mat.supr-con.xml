      <title>Directional driving of vortex lines with oscillating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of driving vortex lines with an oscillating magnetic field could be useful in many applications. For example, it can be used for the removal of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting devices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film with a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field applied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single flux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the behavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average velocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is the presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when the line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer multiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are rather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$ dominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The onset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the frequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low frequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the amplitude. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of vortex lines driven by oscillating magnetic field in patterned superconducting films, offering potential pathways for controlling the magnetic flux in superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Inverse ac Josephson effect in Josephson diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Josephson junction where nonreciprocal critical current was induced by the interplay of the $4\pi$-periodic and $2\pi$-periodic current-phase relation of the junction. We take the model of a topological junction which serves as a Josephson diode with nonreciprocal critical currents. For this Josephson diode, we demonstrate an inverse ac Josephson effect where an effective dc voltage is induced by a pure ac driving current. We show that this inverse ac Josephson effect originates from the voltage rectification by the nonreciprocal critical current of the system. We explore the dependence of the induced dc voltage on the amplitude and frequency of the ac driving current and reveal the optimized condition for the inverse ac Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>Tri-component-pairing chiral superconductivity on the honeycomb lattice with mixed s- and d-wave symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate chiral topological superconductors on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with coexisting d_1- (i.e., x^2-y^2), d_2- (i.e., xy), and s-wave pairing symmetries. Using a Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis, the pairing gap function is shown to exhibit a tri-component form s + d_1 exp(i phi_1) + d_2 exp(i phi_2), where phi_1 and phi_2 are phase differences between the d- and s-wave pairing components, which spontaneously breaks both time reversal and C_6 rotational symmetries. Chern numbers of the energy bands are calculated to be nonzero, demonstrating the topologically nontrivial nature of the system. The anomalous AC Hall conductivity is also computed, which is not invariant under C_6 rotations, reflecting the anisotropic nature of the pairing gap function.</description>

      <title>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposed recently by the author Q-ball mechanism of the pseudogap state and high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates (2022) was supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ (2023). In the present paper it is demonstrated that T-linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity arises naturally in the Q-ball gas phase, that may explain corresponding experimental data in the "strange metal" phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates, as reviewed by Barisic et al. (2013). In the present theory it arises due to scattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin fluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the "strange metal" phase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a slide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation paraconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with experimental data by L.Li et al. (2010) in the "strange metal" phase. In total, obtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons systems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic frequency $\Omega=2\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum thermodynamic time polycrystals. Presented theory may give a clue concerning a possible mechanism of the experimentally measured properties of high-T$_c$ cuprates in the "strange metal" phase of their phase diagram. We believe , these results provide support to the quantum thermodynamic time crystal model of the Euclidean Q-balls considered in the present paper.</description>

      <title>The Universal Gap-to-Critical Temperature Ratio in Superconductors: a Statistical Mechanical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a statistical mechanical framework to unify the observed relationship between the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$, the pseudogap $\Delta^\ast$, and the critical temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. In this model, fermions couple as a composite boson and condense to occupy a single bound state as the temperature drops. We derive a concise formula for $T_\mathrm{c}$ in terms of $\Delta$ and $\Delta^\ast$, namely: $$\frac{\Delta}{k_\mathrm{B} T_\mathrm{c}} = 1.4+4\log(\Delta^\ast/\Delta).$$ This expression reproduces the standard BCS gap-to-$T_\mathrm{c}$ ratio in the absence of a pseudogap, while naturally explaining its enhancement in unconventional superconductors. The model is supported by comparisons with experimental data from several cuprates and iron-based superconductors, which highlight its generality. This formulation also offers a theoretical explanation for the observed persistence of the pseudogap phase into the overdoped regime.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbital Intertwined Topological Superconductivity in a Class of Correlated Noncentrosymmetric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium plasmon fluid in a Josephson junction chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium quantum systems are often described by a collection of weakly-interacting normal modes. Bringing such systems far from equilibrium, however, can drastically enhance mode-to-mode interactions. Understanding the resulting quantum fluid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics, and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the nonequilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting nonequilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the non-local redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation -- an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium fluid of plasmons.</description>

      <title>$t$-$J$ model for strongly correlated two-orbital systems: Application to bilayer nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a $t$-$J$ model applicable to strongly correlated two-orbital systems including bilayer nickelate superconductors. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Geometric superfluid weight of composite bands in multiorbital superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superfluid weight of an isolated flat band in multi-orbital superconductors contains contributions from the band's quantum metric and a lattice geometric term that depends on the orbital positions in the lattice. Since the superfluid weight is a measure of the superconductor's energy fluctuation, it is independent of the lattice geometry, leading to the minimal quantum metric of a band [Phys. Rev. B 106, 014518 (2022)]. Here, a perturbation approach is developed to study the superfluid weight and its lattice geometric dependence for composite bands. When all orbitals exhibit uniform pairing, the quantum geometric term contains each band's contribution and an inter-band contribution between every pair of bands in the composite. Based on a band representation analysis, they provide a topological lower bound for the superfluid weight of an isolated composite of flat bands. Using this perturbation approach, an analytical expression of the lattice geometric contribution is obtained. It is expressed in terms of Bloch functions, providing a convenient formula to calculate the superfluid weight for multi-orbital superconductors.</description>

      <title>Detecting Thermodynamic Phase Transition via Explainable Machine Learning of Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying thermodynamic signatures of electronic phases, such as superconductivity, is challenging in low-dimensional materials due to strong fluctuations and low probing volume. Spectroscopic methods are often used to identify new bulk phases, but their main measurable quantity -- electronic energy gaps -- is no longer an effective order parameter in low-dimensional and fluctuating systems. Combining angle-resolved photoemission with a domain-adversarial neural network, we report a data-driven method to identify thermodynamic phase transitions solely based on single-particle spectra. We demonstrate 97.6$\%$ accuracy in cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ with strong superconducting fluctuations. This model notably compensates for the scarcity of experimental data by leveraging virtually inexhaustible simulated data. Further, its explainability reveals the crucial role of in-gap spectral weight in detecting phase fluctuations and thermodynamic transitions. Our work pinpoints the spectroscopic signatures of fluctuating orders and enables using spectroscopy for machine-learning-assisted material discovery for low-dimensional and strong coupling systems.</description>

Abstract: We present simple qualitative estimates for the maximal superconducting transition temperature, which may be achieved due to electron - phonon coupling in Eliashberg-McMillan theory. It is shown that in the limit of very strong coupling the upper limit for transition temperature is determined in fact by a combination of atomic constants and density of conduction electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-analytic Bloch eigenstates at isolated band degeneracy points exhibit singular behavior in the quantum metric. Here, a description of superfluid weight for zero-energy flat bands in proximity to other high-energy bands is presented, where they together form a singular band gap system. When the singular band gap closes, the geometric and conventional contributions to the superfluid weight as a function of the superconducting gap exhibit different crossover behaviors. The scaling behavior of superfluid weight with the band gap is studied in detail, and the effect on the Berezinskii-KosterlitzThouless (BKT) transition temperature is explored. It is discovered that tuning the singular band gap provides a unique mechanism for enhancing the supercurrent and critical temperature of two-dimensional (2D) superconductors.</description>

Abstract: In the fabrication of superconducting devices, both in situ and ex situ processes are utilized, making the removal of unwanted oxide layers and impurities under vacuum conditions crucial. Oxygen descumming and argon milling are standard in situ cleaning methods employed for device preparation. We investigated the impact of these techniques on tantalum superconducting thin films using scanning tunneling microscopy at millikelvin temperatures. We demonstrate that these cleaning methods inadvertently introduce magnetic bound states within the superconducting gap of tantalum, likely by oxygen impurities. These bound states can be detrimental to superconducting qubit devices, as they add to dephasing and energy relaxation.</description>

      <title>Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</description>

Abstract: Nonreciprocal transport in superconducting systems serves as a powerful probe of symmetry-breaking mechanisms, with the superconducting diode effect emerging as a key manifestation enabling cryogenic rectification. While theoretical models have extensively explored superconducting nonreciprocity, experimental verification remains challenging, as conventional transport measurements struggle to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic contributions. Nonlinear transport analysis, particularly second-harmonic response, offers an alternative approach by providing a sensitive probe for detecting spatial inversion symmetry breaking in the presence of time-reversal symmetry violation. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of geometric symmetry on nonreciprocal transport by comparing two triangular-extended Hall bar configurations with a symmetric Hall bar control. Second-harmonic nonlinear transport measurements reveal that the triangular extension significantly enhances nonreciprocal response, exhibiting a clear dependence on the base angle of the extension. These findings establish a direct connection between mesoscopic geometry and macroscopic nonreciprocity, demonstrating how spatial symmetry and vortex dynamics govern nonlinear transport. This insight offers a guiding principle for designing superconducting rectification architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Flat-Band Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several physical phenomena in superconductors, such as helical superconductivity and the diode effect, rely on breaking time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry-breaking is usually accounted for via the Lifshitz invariant, a contribution to the free energy which is linear in the phase gradient of the order parameter. In dispersive single-band superconductors with conventional pairing, the Lifshitz invariant can be computed from the asymmetries of the spectrum near the Fermi surface. We show that in multi-band superconductors, the quantum geometry also contributes to the Lifshitz invariant, and this is the dominant contribution when the low-energy bands are flat.</description>

      <title>Imaging Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2</title>

Abstract: Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.</description>

      <title>Topological Degeneracy Induced Flat Bands in two-Dimensional Holed Systems</title>

Abstract: Systems hosting flat bands offer a powerful platform for exploring strong correlation physics. Theoretically topological degeneracy rising in systems with non-trivial topological orders on periodic manifolds of non-zero genus can generate ideal flat bands. However, experimental realization of such geometrically engineered systems is very difficult. In this work, we demonstrate that flat planes with strategically patterned hole defects can engineer ideal flat bands. We constructing two families of models, singular flat band systems where degeneracy is stabilized by non-contractible loop excitations tied to hole defects and perfectly nested van Hove systems where degeneracy arises from line excitations in momentum space. These models circumvent the need for exotic manifolds while retaining the essential features of topological flat bands. By directly linking defect engineering to degeneracy mechanisms, our results establish a scalable framework for experimentally accessible flat band design.</description>

      <title>A Clue on Small-Capacitance Josephson Junction: What to Expect from Cooper Pair Ideal Conductor and Ohmic Resistor in Parallel?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using analytical and Worldline Monte Carlo approaches, we investigate the effects induced by quantum phase fluctuations combined with quasiparticle subgap and shunt resistances on a small-capacitance Josephson junction. By using the linear response theory in the presence of two biasing schemes, we prove that the ideal conduction, foreseen in the pioneering papers on this topic, is not robust against either quantum phase fluctuations or dissipative effects. By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an increase of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic equilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic equilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle motion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to localized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly believed. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle changes from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the environment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge response function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the transition. Consequences beyond the linear response regime are investigated, leading to an alternative comprehensive physical picture for this system: we predict a transition from a dissipative quasiparticle current to a polaronic Cooper pair current.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19279v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Numerical simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems, leading to two universal laws describing the nature of information dynamics.</description>
