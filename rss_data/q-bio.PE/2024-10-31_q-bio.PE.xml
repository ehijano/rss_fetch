      <title>Improving the mean-field approximation in continuous models of population dynamics with nonlocal dispersal: applications to vegetation pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spot patterns, in which vegetation patches form a hexagonal lattice, are frequent in nature and could serve as an early-warning indicator of abrupt vegetation collapses. Consequently, they have been intensively studied using both individual-based models and density-based field equations. Yet, the relationship between these two approaches remains unclear, particularly in scenarios where vegetation dynamics exhibit strong long-range spatial correlations and traditional mean-field approximations fail. To solve this issue, we develop a new method that refines mean-field approximations by describing both the dynamics of the biomass density field and its spatial correlations. This new approach harnesses the strengths of both individual and density-based mdoels, treating spatial correlations explicitly and allowing for the identification of spatial instabilities resulting in periodic patterns. Our results indicate that this new approximation predicts the parameter regimes where regular periodic patterns emerge more accurately than mean-field models, suggesting that it could provide a more robust framework to perform further nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Seasonal social dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social dilemmas where the good of a group is at odds with individual interests are usually considered as static -- the dilemma does not change over time. In the COVID-19 pandemic, social dilemmas occurred in the mitigation of epidemic spread: Should I reduce my contacts or wear a mask to protect others? In the context of respiratory diseases, which are predominantly spreading during the winter months, some of these situations re-occur seasonally. We couple a game theoretical model, where individuals can adjust their behavior, to an epidemiological model with seasonal forcing. We find that social dilemmas can occur annually and that behavioral reactions to them can either decrease or increase the peaks of infections in a population. Our work has not only implications for seasonal infectious diseases, but also more generally for oscillatory social dilemmas: A complex interdependence between behavior and external dynamics emerges. To be effective and to exploit behavioral dynamics, intervention measures to mitigate re-occuring social dilemmas have to be timed carefully.</description>

      <title>Bridging Wright-Fisher and Moran models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wright-Fisher model and the Moran model are both widely used in population genetics. They describe the time evolution of the frequency of an allele in a well-mixed population with fixed size. We propose a simple and tractable model which bridges the Wright-Fisher and the Moran descriptions. We assume that a fixed fraction of the population is updated at each discrete time step. In this model, we determine the fixation probability of a mutant and its average fixation and extinction times, under the diffusion approximation. We further study the associated coalescent process, which converges to Kingman's coalescent, and we calculate effective population sizes. We generalize our model, first by taking into account fluctuating updated fractions or individual lifetimes, and then by incorporating selection on the lifetime as well as on the reproductive fitness.</description>

      <title>A minimal model for multigroup adaptive SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the adaptive N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (aNIMFA) model studied in \emph{Achterberg and Sensi} \cite{achterbergsensi2022adaptive} to a heterogeneous network of communities. In particular, the multigroup aNIMFA model describes the impact of both local and global disease awareness on the spread of a disease in a network. We obtain results on existence and stability of the equilibria of the system, in terms of the basic reproduction number~$R_0$. Under light constraints, we show that the basic reproduction number~$R_0$ is equivalent to the basic reproduction number of the NIMFA model on static networks. Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrate that with just two communities periodic behaviour can occur, which contrasts the case with only a single community, in which periodicity was ruled out analytically. We also find that breaking connections between communities is more fruitful compared to breaking connections within communities to reduce the disease outbreak on dense networks, but both strategies are viable to networks with fewer links. Finally, we emphasise that our method of modelling adaptivity is not limited to SIS models, but has huge potential to be applied in other compartmental models in epidemiology.</description>
