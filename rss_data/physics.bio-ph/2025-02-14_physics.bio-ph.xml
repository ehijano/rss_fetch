      <title>NextGenPB: an analytically-enabled super resolution and local (de)refinement Poisson-Boltzmann Equation solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) is a relevant partial differential equation commonly used in biophysical applications to estimate the electrostatic energy of biomolecular systems immersed in electrolytic solutions. A conventional mean to improve the accuracy of its solution, when grid-based numerical techniques are used, consists in increasing the resolution, locally or globally. This, however, usually entails higher complexity, memory demand and computational cost. Here, we introduce NextGenPB, a linear PBE, adaptive-grid, FEM solver that leverages analytical calculations to maximize the accuracy-to-computational-cost ratio. Indeed, in NextGenPB (aka NGPB), analytical corrections at the surface of the solute enhance the solution's accuracy without requiring grid adaptation. This leads to more precise estimates of the electrostatic potential, fields, and energy at no perceptible additional cost. Also, we apply computationally efficient yet accurate boundary conditions by taking advantage of local grid de-refinement. To assess the accuracy of our methods directly, we expand the traditionally available analytical case set to many non-overlapping dielectric spheres. Then, we use an existing benchmark set of real biomolecular systems to evaluate the energy convergence concerning grid resolution. Thanks to these advances, we have improved state-of-the-art results and shown that the approach is accurate and largely scalable for modern high-performance computing architectures. Lastly, we suggest that the presented core ideas could be instrumental in improving the solution of other partial differential equations with discontinuous coefficients.</description>

      <title>Collective migration and topological phase transitions in confluent epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective epithelial migration leverages on topological rearrangements of the intercellular junctions, which allow cells to intercalate without loosing confluency. In silico studies have provided a clear indication that this process could occur via a two-step phase transition, where a hierarchy of topological excitations progressively transforms an epithelial layer from a crystalline solid to an isotropic liquid, via an intermediate hexatic liquid crystal phase. Yet, the fundamental mechanism behind this process and its implications for collective cell behavior are presently unknown. In this article, we show that the onset of collective cell migration in cell-resolved models of epithelial layers takes place via an activity-driven melting transition, characterized by an exponentially-divergent correlation length across the solid/hexatic phase boundary. Using a combination of numerical simulations and Renormalization Group analysis, we show that the availability of topologically distinct rearrangements - known as T1 and T2 processes - and of a non-thermal route to melting, renders the transition significantly more versatile and tunable than in two-dimensional passive matter. Specifically, the relative frequency of T1 and T2 processes and of the "bare" stiffness of the cell layer affect the divergence of positional correlations within a well-defined spectrum of critical behaviors. Suppressing T1 processes, changes the nature of the transition by preventing collective migration in favor of a cellular analog of surface sublimation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary evolution of cubic-quintic NLSE drop-like solitons in DNA-protein systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear molecular excitations in DNA have traditionally been modelled using the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE). An alternative approach is based on the plane-base rotator model and the SU(2)/U(1) generalized spin coherent states, which leads to a cubic quintic NLSE. Higher-order nonlinearities are particularly useful for modelling complex interactions, such as those in DNA-protein systems, where multiple competing forces play a significant role. Additionally, the surrounding viscous medium introduces dissipative forces that affect the propagation of molecular excitations, leading to energy dissipation and damping effects. These damping effects are modelled using the quasi-stationary method, which describes the system's near-equilibrium behaviour. In this work, we explore the evolution of nonlinear molecular excitations in DNA-protein systems, accounting for damping effects, and discuss potential applications to the transcription process.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>
