      <title>Single attosecond XUV pulse source via light-wave controlled relativistic laser-plasma interaction: Thomson Back Scattering Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflecting light off a mirror moving near light speed, as first envisioned by Einstein, offers a powerful method for generating bright, ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range. Recent breakthroughs show that dense relativistic electron mirrors can be created by striking a nanometre-scale foil with a high-intensity, sharp-front laser pulse, forming a single relativistic electron sheet (RES). This RES coherently reflects and upshifts a counter-propagating laser beam from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet with efficiency exceeding incoherent scattering by over several orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the drive laser waveform can reliably produce a single RES, leading to generation of isolated \emph{attosecond} pulses enhancing both intensity and temporal compression of the back reflected light in a controlled manner. Simulations reveal that tuning parameters like timing delay enables control over the amplitude, duration, and bandwidth of the resulting attosecond Thomson backscattering (TBS) pulse. Together, these advances meet key experimental challenges and pave the way for compact, tunable sources of isolated attosecond pulses for probing ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Landau Damping with Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction effects on particle dynamics in intense counterpropagating laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, particles can lose a substantial fraction of their energy by emitting radiation. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we study the impact of radiation reaction on the dynamics of an underdense plasma target struck by counterpropagating circularly polarized laser pulses. By varying the relative wavelengths and intensities of the pulses, we find a range of parameters where radiation reaction can detrap electrons from the interference beat wave. The resulting charge separation field and the dominant direction of ion expulsion are thus reversed by radiative effects. Based on the electron dynamics during the interaction, we estimate the bounds on the parameter regime where the reversal occurs. The bounds take the form of three simple inequalities which depend only on the wavelength, normalized vector potential, and pulse duration ratios of the two lasers as well as the product of the pulse duration with a dimensionless radiation reaction parameter. Our estimates, which predict whether radiation reaction will change the final ion direction for a given set of laser parameters, broadly agree with the simulated results. Finally, we outline an experimental procedure by which the reversal could be used to observe the transition to radiation-dominated dynamics.</description>

      <title>Identification and Characterization of a New Disruption Regime in ADITYA-U Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disruptions continue to pose a significant challenge to the stable operation and future design of tokamak reactors. A comprehensive statistical investigation carried out on the ADITYA-U tokamak has led to the observation and characterization of a novel disruption regime. In contrast to the conventional Locked Mode Disruption (LMD), the newly identified disruption exhibits a distinctive two-phase evolution: an initial phase characterized by a steady rise in mode frequency with a nonlinearly saturated amplitude, followed by a sudden frequency collapse accompanied by a pronounced increase in amplitude. This behaviour signifies the onset of the precursor phase on a significantly shorter timescale. Clear empirical thresholds have been identified to distinguish this disruption type from conventional LMD events, including edge safety factor, current decay coefficient, current quench (CQ) time, and CQ rate. The newly identified disruption regime is predominantly governed by the (m/n = 2/1) drift-tearing mode (DTM), which, in contrast to typical disruptions in the ADITYA-U tokamak that involve both m/n = 2/1 and 3/1 modes, consistently manifests as the sole dominant instability. Initiated by core temperature hollowing, the growth of this mode is significantly enhanced by a synergistic interplay between a strongly localized pressure gradient and the pronounced steepening of the current density profile in the vicinity of the mode rational surface.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Transfer Matrix of a Plasma Ramp with Squared Cosine Shape via an Approximate Solution of the Mathieu Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high longitudinal electric fields generated in plasma wakefields are very attractive for a new generation of high gradient plasma based accelerators. On the other hand, the strong transverse fields increase the demand for a proper matching device in order to avoid the spoiling of beam transverse quality. A solution can be provided by the use of a plasma ramp, a region at the plasma injection/extraction with smoothly increasing/decreasing plasma density. The transport of a beam inside a plasma ramp, beside its parameters, depends on the profile of the ramp itself. Establishing the transfer matrix for a plasma ramp represents a very useful tool in order to evaluate the beam evolution in the plasma. In this paper a study of a cosine squared ramp is presented. An approximate solution of the transverse equation of motion is evaluated and exploited to provide a simple transfer matrix for the plasma ramp. The transfer matrix is then employed to demonstrate that this kind of ramp has the effect to minimize the emittance growth due to betatron dephasing. The behavior of a squared cosine plasma ramp will be compared with an experimentally measured plasma ramp profile in order to validate the applicability of the transfer matrix to real cases.</description>

      <title>Characterizing proton polytropic indices inside near-Earth magnetic clouds and ICME sheaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) is often described using a polytropic process. Estimating the polytopic index ($\gamma$) allows us to quantify the expansion or compression of the ICME plasma arising from changes in the plasma temperature. In this study, we estimate $\gamma$ for protons inside the magnetic clouds (MCs), their associated sheaths, and ambient solar wind for a large sample of well-observed events observed by the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU. We find that $\gamma$ shows a high ($\approx 1.6$) - low ($\approx 1.05$) - high ($\approx 1.2$) behavior inside the ambient solar wind, sheath, and MCs, respectively. We also find that the proton polytropic index is independent of small-scale density fluctuations. Furthermore, our results show that the stored energy inside MC plasma is not expended in expanding its cross-section at 1 AU. The sub-adiabatic nature of MC plasma implies external heating - possibly due to thermal conduction from the corona. We find that the heating gradient per unit mass from the corona to the protons of MC at 1 AU is $\approx 0.21$ erg cm$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$ which is in agreement with the required proton heating budget.</description>

      <title>A Subgrid Model for Electron-Scale Turbulent Transport in Global Ion-Scale Gyrokinetic Simulations of Tokamak Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subgrid electron-temperature-gradient (ETG) model is demonstrated here which averages local electron-scale turbulence from the GENE code over intermediate scales in space and time to include in global ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) GEM simulations. This approach results in ion-scale equations which include the electron heat transport from ETG turbulence and the effects of electron-scale turbulence on the ion scale. Flux-tube ETG Cyclone Base Case simulations are carried out using GENE at different radial locations and a kinetic form of the flux is added to ion-scale global GEM simulations as a source term. Analytic radial profiles of ETG heat flux are constructed and compared to flux-tube results at multiple radial locations. Different ratios of ITG to ETG turbulent heat flux levels are considered and the results of capturing ETG heat transport in global GEM simulations are discussed. Possibilities for coupling of the ETG streamer potential and intermediate-scale zonal flows found in ETG simulations to the ion scale are further discussed.</description>

      <title>Upgrade of the Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injector for the RFX-mod2 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP), was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for a maximum ion current of 5 A. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several power units faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. Magnetic field survival tests were performed on the toroidal-core-based DC-DC converters that should power the electronic boards in a reliable way. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.</description>

      <title>The response of warm absorbers to the variations in the ionizing continuum in the active galaxy NGC 4051</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of the warm absorbers in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4051, which has an active galactic nucleus (AGN), using observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Despite NICER's moderate spectral resolution, its high-cadence monitoring allows us to probe the response of the ionized outflows, also known as warm absorbers, on timescales of approximately 5500 seconds. We detect two distinct components of ionized absorbers in this source. The ionization parameter of the low-ionization warm absorber component tracks changes in the ionizing flux with no measurable time lag. This rapid response implies photoionization equilibrium and places a lower limit on the electron density of about 9 x 10^6 cm^-3, based on the most abundant ionic species, O VII. The absorber is located within approximately 0.02 parsecs of the central source, consistent with an origin in the inner regions of the active nucleus. In contrast, the high-ionization absorber remains consistently under-ionized relative to equilibrium predictions. This suggests that it may be collisional plasma, as also indicated in previous studies. These results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy, even with moderate-resolution instruments, can provide valuable constraints on the density and location of warm absorbers in AGN. As a potential contributor to AGN feedback, the study of these ionized outflows is crucial to understanding AGN--host galaxy interactions.</description>
