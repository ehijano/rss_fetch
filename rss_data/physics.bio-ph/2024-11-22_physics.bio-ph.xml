      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Working Memory via Moment Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans possess a finely tuned sense of uncertainty that helps anticipate potential errors, vital for adaptive behavior and survival. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study applies moment neural networks (MNNs) to explore the neural mechanism of uncertainty quantification in working memory (WM). The MNN captures nonlinear coupling of the first two moments in spiking neural networks (SNNs), identifying firing covariance as a key indicator of uncertainty in encoded information. Trained on a WM task, the model demonstrates coding precision and uncertainty quantification comparable to human performance. Analysis reveals a link between the probabilistic and sampling-based coding for uncertainty representation. Transferring the MNN's weights to an SNN replicates these results. Furthermore, the study provides testable predictions demonstrating how noise and heterogeneity enhance WM performance, highlighting their beneficial role rather than being mere biological byproducts. These findings offer insights into how the brain effectively manages uncertainty with exceptional accuracy.</description>

      <title>Competitive binding of Activator-Repressor in Stochastic Gene Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regulation of gene expression is the consequence of interactions between the promoter of the gene and the transcription factors (TFs). In this paper, we explore the features of a genetic network where the TFs (activators and repressors) bind the promoter in a competitive way. We develop an analytical theory that offers detailed reaction kinetics of the competitive activator-repressor system which could be the powerful tools for extensive study and analysis of the genetic circuit in future research. Moreover, the theoretical approach helps us to find a most probable set of parameter values which was unavailable in experiments. We study the noisy behaviour of the circuit and compare the profile with the network where the activator and repressor bind the promoter non-competitively. We further notice that, due to the effect of transcriptional reinitiation in the presence of the activator and repressor molecules, there exits some anomalous characteristic features in the mean expressions and noise profiles. We find that, in presence of the reinitiation the noise in transcriptional level remains low while it is higher in translational level than the noise when the reinitiation is absent. In addition, it is possible to reduce the noise further below the Poissonian level in competitive circuit than the non-competitive one with the help of some noise reducing parameters.</description>

      <title>Long-term predictive models for mosquito borne diseases: a narrative review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In face of climate change and increasing urbanization, the predictive mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) transmission models require constant updates. Thus, is urgent to comprehend the driving forces of this non stationary behavior, observed through spatial and incidence expansion. We observed that temperature is a critical driver in predictive models for MBD transmission, also being consistently used in multiple reviewed papers with considerable incidence predictive capacity. Rainfall, however, have more subtle importance as moderate precipitation creates breeding sites for mosquitoes, but excessive rainfall can reduce larvae populations. We highlight the frequent use of mechanistic models, particularly those that integrate temperature-dependent biological parameters of disease transmission in incidence proxies as the Vectorial Capacity (VC) and temperature-based basic reproduction number $R_0(t)$, for example. These models show the importance of climate variables, but the socio-demographic factors are often not considered. This gap is a significant opportunity for future research to incorporate socio-demographic data into long-term predictive models for more comprehensive and reliable forecasts. With this survey, we outline the most promising paths to be followed by long-term MBD transmission research and highlighting the potential facing challenges. Thus, we offer a valuable foundation for enhancing disease forecasting models and supporting more effective public health interventions, specially in the long term.</description>
