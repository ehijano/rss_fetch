      <title>Flipping Non-Crossing Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a set $P$ of $n$ points in general position in the plane, the flip graph $F(P)$ has a vertex for each non-crossing spanning tree on $P$ and an edge between any two spanning trees that can be transformed into each other by one edge flip. The diameter ${\rm diam}(F(P))$ of this graph is subject of intensive study. For points in general position, it is between $3n/2-5$ and $2n-4$, with no improvement for 25 years. For points in convex position, it lies between $3n/2 - 5$ and $\approx1.95n$, where the lower bound was conjectured to be tight up to an additive constant and the upper bound is a recent breakthrough improvement over several bounds of the form $2n-o(n)$.
  In this work, we provide new upper and lower bounds on ${\rm diam}(F(P))$, mainly focusing on points in convex position. We show $14n/9 - O(1) \le {\rm diam}(F(P)) \le 5n/3 - 3$, by this disproving the conjectured upper bound of $3n/2$ for convex position, and relevantly improving both the long-standing lower bound for general position and the recent new upper bound for convex position. We complement these by showing that if one of $T,T'$ has at most two boundary edges, then ${\rm dist}(T,T') \le 2d/2 &lt; 3n/2$, where $d = |T-T'|$ is the number of edges in one tree that are not in the other.
  To prove both the upper and the lower bound, we introduce a new powerful tool. Specifically, we convert the flip distance problem for given $T,T'$ to the problem of a largest acyclic subset in an associated conflict graph $H(T,T')$. In fact, this method is powerful enough to give an equivalent formulation of the diameter of $F(P)$ for points $P$ in convex position up to lower-order terms. As such, conflict graphs are likely the key to a complete resolution of this and possibly also other reconfiguration problems.</description>

      <title>Computing Diameter +1 in Truly Subquadratic Time for Unit-Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the diameter of a graph in general cannot be done in truly subquadratic assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), even when the underlying graph is unweighted and sparse. When restricting to concrete classes of graphs and assuming SETH, planar graphs and minor-free graphs admit truly subquadratic algorithms, while geometric intersection graphs of unit balls, congruent equilateral triangles, and unit segments do not. Unit-disk graphs are one of the major open cases where the complexity of diameter computation remains unknown. More generally, it is conjectured that a truly-subquadratic time algorithm exists for pseudo-disk graphs where each pair of objects has at most two intersections on the boundary.
  In this paper, we show a truly-subquadratic algorithm of running time $\tilde{O}(n^{2-1/18})$, for finding the diameter in a unit-disk graph, whose output differs from the optimal solution by at most 1. This is the first algorithm that provides an additive guarantee in distortion, independent of the size or the diameter of the graph. Our algorithm requires two important technical elements. First, we show that for the intersection graph of pseudo-disks, the graph VC-dimension, either of $k$-hop balls or the distance encoding vectors, is 4. Second, we introduce a clique-based $r$-clustering for geometric intersection graphs, which is an analog of the $r$-division construction for planar graphs. We also showcase the new techniques by establishing new results for distance oracles for unit-disk graphs with subquadratic storage and $O(1)$ query time. The results naturally extend to unit $L_1$- or $L_\infty$-disks and fat pseudo-disks of similar size. Last, if the pseudo-disks additionally have bounded ply, we have a truly-subquadratic algorithm to find the exact diameter.</description>

      <title>Toroidal density-equalizing map for genus-one surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density-equalizing map is a shape deformation technique originally developed for cartogram creation and sociological data visualization on planar geographical maps. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in developing density-equalizing mapping methods for surface and volumetric domains and applying them to various problems in geometry processing and imaging science. However, the existing surface density-equalizing mapping methods are only applicable to surfaces with relatively simple topologies but not surfaces with topological holes. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm for computing density-equalizing maps for toroidal surfaces. In particular, different shape deformation effects can be easily achieved by prescribing different population functions on the torus and performing diffusion-based deformations on a planar domain with periodic boundary conditions. Furthermore, the proposed toroidal density-equalizing mapping method naturally leads to an effective method for computing toroidal parameterizations of genus-one surfaces with controllable shape changes, with the toroidal area-preserving parameterization being a prime example. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>
