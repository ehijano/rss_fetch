      <title>Sharpening a gap theorem: nonnegative Ricci and small curvature concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We sharpen a gap theorem of Chan &amp; Lee for nonnegative Ricci curvature manifolds that have positive asymptotic volume ratio and small enough scale-invariant integral curvature (so-called "curvature concentration"), by showing that the curvature concentration need only depend linearly on the asymptotic volume ratio. We prove the result by exhibiting a long-time Ricci flow solution with faster than $1/t$ curvature decay, which allows us to shift the limiting contradiction argument to time infinity and thus obtain an explicit bound on the size of the gap.</description>

      <title>Time geodesics on a slippery cross slope under gravitational wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we pose and solve the time-optimal navigation problem considered on a slippery mountain slope modeled by a Riemannian manifold of an arbitrary dimension, under the action of a cross gravitational wind. The impact of both lateral and longitudinal components of gravitational wind on the time geodesics is discussed. The varying along-gravity effect depends on traction in the presented model, whereas the cross-gravity additive is taken entirely in the equations of motion, for any direction and gravity force. We obtain the conditions for strong convexity and the purely geometric solution to the problem is given by a new Finsler metric, which belongs to the type of general $(\alpha, \beta)$-metrics. The proposed model enables us to create a direct link between the Zermelo navigation problem and the slope-of-a-mountain problem under the action of a cross gravitational wind. Moreover, the behavior of the Finslerian indicatrices and time-minimizing trajectories in relation to the traction coefficient and gravitational wind force are explained and illustrated by a few examples in dimension two. This also compares the corresponding solutions on the slippery slopes under various cross- and along-gravity effects, including the classical Matsumoto's slope-of-a-mountain problem and Zermelo's navigation.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Hitchin metric and the semi-flat metric in the rank two case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(E,\theta)$ be a Higgs bundle of rank $2$ and degree $0$ on a compact Riemann surface $X$ whose spectral curve is smooth. The tangent space of the moduli space of Higgs bundles at $(E,\theta)$ is equipped with two natural metrics called the Hitchin metric and the semi-flat metric. It is known that the difference between two metrics along the curve $(E,t\theta)$ $(t\geq 1)$ decays in an exponential way. In this paper, we shall study how the exponential rate is improved.</description>

      <title>Weyls's law for Compact Rank One Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyls law is a fundamental result governing the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues of teh Laplacian. It states that for a compact d dimensional manifold M (without boundary), the eigenvalue counting function has an asymptotic growth, whose leading term is of the order of d and the error term is no worse than order d-1.
  A natural question is: when is the error term sharp and when can it be improved? It has been known for a long time that the error term is sharp for the round sphere (since 1968). In contrast, it has only recently been shown (in 2019) by Iosevich and Wyman that for the product of spheres, the error term can be polynomially improved. They conjecture that a polynomial improvement should be true for products in general. In this paper we extend both these results to Compact Rank One Symmetric Spaces (CROSSes). We show that for CROSSes, the error term is sharp. Furthermore, we show that for a product of CROSSes, the error term can be polynomially improved. This gives further evidence to the conjecture made by Iosevich and Wyman.</description>

      <title>Complete minimal hypersurfaces in a hyperbolic space $H^{4}(-1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study $n$-dimensional complete minimal hypersurfaces in a hyperbolic space $H^{n+1}(-1)$ of constant curvature $-1$. We prove that a $3$-dimensional complete minimal hypersurface with constant scalar curvature in $H^{4}(-1)$ satisfies $S\leq \frac{21}{29}$ by making use of the Generalized Maximum Principle, where $S$ denotes the squared norm of the second fundamental form of the hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Blow-ups of minimal surfaces in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revise Monti's results on the blow-ups of H-perimeter minimizing sets in $\mathbb{H}^n$. Monti demonstrated that the Lipschitz approximation of the blow-up, after rescaling by the square root of the excess, converges to a limit function for $n \ge 2$. However, the partial differential equation he derived for this limit function $\varphi$ through contact variation is incorrect. Instead, the correct equation is that the horizontal Laplacian of the limit function $\varphi$ is independent of the coordinate $y_1$ and solves equation 1 weakly.</description>

      <title>Magnetic trajectories on Heisenberg nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By fixing the usual metric on the Heisenberg Lie group $H_3$, we consider any left-invariant Lorentz force for which we write the corresponding magnetic equations. The aim of this work is twofold: the study of closed magnetic trajectories on Heisenberg nilmanifolds of dimension three and the inverse problem for this system, which consists in proving the existence of a Lagrangian. The last goal is achieved on $H_3$. By using symmetries coming from convenient actions, we compute the magnetic trajectories through the identity in $H_3$. We determine the closed magnetic trajectories on $H_3$ and consider the existence question on compact quotients $\Lambda\backslash H_3$ for any cocompact lattice $\Lambda\subset H_3$. We prove that the existence of closed magnetic geodesics is not guaranteed on every homotopy class. We give examples of compact quotients $\Gamma_k\backslash H_3$ with infinite many closed magnetic trajectories and compact quotients with no closed non-contractible magnetic trajectory for a given Lorentz force.</description>

      <title>Complete Riemannian 4-manifolds with uniformly positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain topological obstructions to the existence of a complete Riemannian metric with uniformly positive scalar curvature on certain (non-compact) $4$-manifolds. In particular, such a metric on the interior of a compact contractible $4$-manifold uniquely distinguishes the standard $4$-ball up to diffeomorphism among Mazur manifolds and up to homeomorphism in general.
  We additionally show there exist uncountably many exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s that do not admit such a metric and that any (non-compact) tame $4$-manifold has a smooth structure that does not admit such a metric.</description>

      <title>On the stability of Killing cylinders in hyperbolic space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the stability of a Killing cylinder in hyperbolic 3-space when regarded as a capillary surface for the partitioning problem. In contrast with the Euclidean case, we consider a variety of totally umbilical support surfaces, including horospheres, totally geodesic planes, equidistant surfaces and round spheres. In all of them, we explicitly compute the Morse index of the corresponding eigenvalue problem for the Jacobi operator. We also address the stability of compact pieces of Killing cylinders with Dirichlet boundary conditions when the boundary is formed by two fixed circles, exhibiting an analogous to the Plateau-Rayleigh instability criterion for Killing cylinders in the Euclidean space. Finally, we prove that the Delaunay surfaces can be obtained by bifurcating Killing cylinders supported on geodesic planes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical Plateau-Rayleigh instability criterion in the $\mathbb{E}(\kappa,\tau)$ spaces. We prove the existence of a positive number $L_0&gt;0$ such that if a truncated circular cylinder of radius $\rho$ in $\mathbb{E}(\kappa,\tau)$ has length $L&gt;L_0$ then it is unstable. This number $L_0$ depends on $\kappa$, $\tau$ and $\rho$. The value $L_0$ is sharp under axially-symmetric variations of the surface. We also extend this result for the partitioning problem in $\mathbb{E}(\kappa,\tau)$.</description>

      <title>Mabuchi rays, test configurations and quantization for toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Mabuchi rays of toric K\"ahler structures on symplectic toric manifolds which are associated to toric test configurations and that are generated by convex functions on themoment polytope, $P$, whose second derivative has support given by a compact subset $K&lt;P$. Associated to the test configuration there is a polyhedral decomposition of $P$ whose components are approximated by the components of $P \setminus K$. Along such Mabuchi rays, the toric complex structure remains unchanged on the inverse image under the moment map of $(P \setminus \check {K})$, where $\check {K}$ denotes the interior of $K$. At infinite geodesic time, the K\"ahler polarizations along the ray converge to interesting new toric mixed polarizations. The quantization in these limit polarizations is given by restrictions of the monomial holomorphic sections of the K\"ahler quantization, for monomials corresponding to integral points in $P \setminus \check {K}$, and by sections on the fibers of the moment map over the integral points contained in $\check {K}$, which, along the directions parallel to $K$ are holomorphic and which along the directions transverse to $K$ are distributional. These quantizations correspond to quantizations of the central fiber of the test family, in the symplectic picture. We present the case of $S2$ in detail and then generalize to higher dimensional symplectic toric manifolds. Metrically, at infinite Mabuchi geodesic time, the sphere decomposes into two discs and a collection of cylinders, separated by infinitely long lines. Correspondingly, the quantization in the limit polarization decomposes into a direct sum of the contributions from the quantizations of each of these components.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a polarized family of complex projective manifolds, we study the Hermitian Yang-Mills functionals on the sequence of vector bundles over the base of the family associated with direct image sheaves of the tensor powers of the polarization. We make a connection between the asymptotic minimization of these functionals, for big tensor powers of the polarization, and the minimization of the so-called Wess-Zumino-Witten functional defined on the space of all relatively K\"ahler $(1, 1)$-forms on the fibration. We establish the sharp lower bounds on the latter functional in terms of the limiting Harder-Narasimhan measure, which is a certain algebraic invariant of the family. As an application, in a fibered setting, we prove an asymptotic converse to the Andreotti-Grauert theorem conjectured by Demailly.</description>

Abstract: We refine the classical Cauchy--Schwartz inequality $\|X\|_{1} \leq \|X\|_{2}$ by demonstrating that for any $p$ and $q$ with $q&gt;p&gt;2$, there exists a constant $C=C(p,q)$ such that $\|X\|_1 \leq 1 - C \Big{(}\|X\|_p^p - 1\Big{)}^{\frac{q-2}{q-p}}\Big{(}\|X\|_q^q - 1\Big{)}^{\frac{2-p}{q-p}}$ holds true for all Borel measurable random variables $X$ with $\|X\|_{2}=1$ and $\|X\|_{p}&lt;\infty$. We illustrate two applications of this result: one for biased Rademacher sums and another for exponential sums.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\mathfrak g}$ be a Garding-Dirichlet operator on the set S(n) of symmetric $n\times n$ matrices. We assume that ${\mathfrak g}$ is $I$-central, that is, $D_I {\mathfrak g} = k I$ for some $k&gt;0$. Then $$ {\mathfrak g}(A)^{1\over N} \ \geq\ {\mathfrak g}(I)^{1\over N} (\det\, A)^{1\over n} \qquad \forall\, A&gt;0. $$ From work of Guo, Phong, Tong, Abja, Dinew, Olive and many others, this inequality has important applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a convex polytope with non-empty interior in a finite dimensional vector space, such that each vertex of $M$ is contained in exactly $n$ edges of $M$. The Lie group of all smooth diffeomorphisms of $M$ contains the Lie subgroup of all diffeomorphisms which restrict to the identity on the boundary of the polytope. We give the quotient of the diffeomorphism group mod subgroup a Lie group structure. This construction turns the canonical quotient homomorphism into a smooth submersion, and we then obtain related results. We also study controllability on $M$ and show that the identity component of the diffeomorphism group is generated by the exponential image.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, if $W \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a locally strongly convex body (not necessarily compact), then for any open set $V \supset \partial W$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and $V \supset \partial W$ is open, then there exists a $C^2$ locally strongly convex body $W_{\varepsilon, V}$ such that $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\partial W_{\varepsilon, V}\triangle\,\partial W)&lt;\varepsilon$ and $\partial W_{\varepsilon, V}\subset V$. Moreover, if $W$ is strongly convex, then $W_{\varepsilon, V}$ is strongly convex as well.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-Limsup estimate for a nonlocal approximation of the Willmore functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a possible nonlocal approximation of the Willmore functional, in the sense of Gamma-convergence, based on the first variation ot the fractional Allen-Cahn energies, and we prove the corresponding $\Gamma$-limsup estimate. Our analysis is based on the expansion of the fractional Laplacian in Fermi coordinates and fine estimates on the decay of higher order derivatives of the one-dimensional nonlocal optimal profile. This result is the nonlocal counterpart of that obtained by Bellettini and Paolini, where they proposed a phase-field approximation of the Willmore functional based on the first variation of the (local) Allen-Cahn energies.</description>

      <title>On curvature bounds in Lorentzian length spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce several new notions of (sectional) curvature bounds for Lorentzian pre-length spaces: On the one hand, we provide convexity/concavity conditions for the (modified) time separation function, and, on the other hand, we study four-point conditions, which are suitable also for the non-intrinsic setting. Via these concepts we are able to establish (under mild assumptions) the equivalence of all previously known formulations of curvature bounds. In particular, we obtain the equivalence of causal and timelike curvature bounds as introduced in Kunzinger and S\"amann (Ann. Glob. Anal. Geom. 54(3):399-447, 2018).</description>

      <title>On discrete Routh reduction and structures on the reduced space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we work, first, with forced discrete-time mechanical systems on the configuration space $Q$ and construct closed $2$-forms $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$ on $Q \times Q$, that are symplectic if and only if the system is regular. For a special type of discrete force, we prove that $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$ are invariant by the flow of the system. We also consider the Lagrangian reduction of a discrete mechanical system by a symmetry group (using an affine discrete connection derived from the discrete momentum) and prove that, under some conditions on the action, the trajectories of the reduced system (with constant discrete momentum $\mu$) can be seen as trajectories of a forced discrete mechanical system, where the discrete force is of the type analyzed before. Therefore, we prove that there is a symplectic structure that is invariant by the flow of the forced reduced system; the symplectic structure can be seen as a pullback of a canonical cotangent structure plus a magnetic term. This discrete reduction process is the (discrete) Routh reduction and the behavior obtained runs parallel to the well known case for (continuous) Routh reduction.</description>

      <title>Starshaped compact hypersurfaces in warped product manifolds II: a class of Hessian type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we are concerned with one particular class of fully nonlinear Hessian quotient type equations, which were initiated by Chu and Jiao in [Curvature estimates for a class of Hessian type equations. Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations $\textbf{60}$ (2021).]. Previously, various second order estimates have been derived for the $(k,l)$ quotients when $k-l \geq 2$, by following arguments of Chu-Jiao. Here we settle the remaining $k-l=1$ case by invoking a convenient lemma of Chen-Dong-Han in [Interior Hessian estimates for a class of Hessian type equations. Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations $\textbf{62}$ (2023).].</description>

      <title>Nijenhuis geometry of parallel tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tensor -- meaning here a tensor field $\Theta$ of any type $(p,q)$ on a manifold -- may be called integrable if it is parallel relative to some torsion-free connection. We provide analytical and geometric characterizations of integrability for differential $q$-forms, $q=0,1,2,n-1,n$ (in dimension $n$), vectors, bivectors, symmetric $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$ tensors, as well as complex-diagonalizable and nilpotent tensors of type $(1,1)$. In most cases, integrability is equivalent to algebraic constancy of $\Theta$ coupled with the vanishing of one or more suitably defined Nijenhuis-type tensors, depending on $\Theta$ via a quasilinear first-order differential operator. For $(p,q)=(1,1)$, they include the ordinary Nijenhuis tensor.</description>

      <title>Integral invariants for framed 3-manifolds associated to trivalent graphs possibly with self-loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bott--Cattaneo's theory defines the integral invariants for a framed rational homology 3-sphere equipped with an acyclic orthogonal local system, in terms of graph cocycles without self-loops. The 2-loop term of their invariants is associated with the theta graph. Their definition requires a cohomological condition. Cattaneo--Shimizu removed this cohomological condition and gave a 2-loop invariant associated with a linear combination of the theta graph and the dumbbell graph, the 2-loop trivalent graph with self-loops. In this paper, we are concerned with an acyclic local system given by the adjoint representation of a semi-simple Lie group composed with a representation of the fundamental group of a closed 3-manifold, and we show that through a cohomological construction eventually the integral associated with the dumbbell graph vanishes. Based on this idea, we construct a theory of graph complexes and cocycles, so that higher-loop invariants can be defined by two different but equivalent methods: the graph cocycles without self-loops as in Bott--Cattaneo's theory, and the ones with self-loops that extend Cattaneo--Shimizu's 2-loop invariants. As a consequence, we prove that the generating series of Chern--Simons perturbation theory gives rise to topological invariants for framed 3-manifolds in our setting, which admits a formula in terms of only trivalent graphs without self-loops.</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates for a family of Poisson problems: `rounding off the corners'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove \emph{uniform solvability estimates} for certain families of elliptic problems posed in a bounded family of domains (for example, a sequence that converges to another domain). We provide uniform estimates both in weighted and in usual Sobolev spaces. When the limit domain is a \emph{polygon} and the other domains are smooth, our results amount to rounding off'' the corners of the limit domain. The technique of proof is based on a suitable conformal modification of the metric, which makes the union of the domains a manifold with boundary and relative bounded geometry.</description>
