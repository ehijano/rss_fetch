      <title>IECZ-III: Hardcore Condensation Lift with Size-Aware Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a compact, size-aware blueprint for transferring structure through gadget lifts. Two low-order invariants -- cumulative mod-$q$ Fourier mass up to degree $k$ and noise stability $\mathrm{Stab}_\rho$ -- are treated as a reusable "profile" tied to the gadget's affine interface. Under coordinate permutations ($\Delta=1$) the profile is preserved exactly; under bounded fan-in the degree budget relaxes by at most $+\Delta k$ (i.e., $k \mapsto k + \Delta k$), with all overheads tracked explicitly. In a balanced window $m=(1+\gamma)n$ the framework yields a distributional lower bound for a monotone cost (Erasure Complexity, EC) and an "echo" to correlation against size-aware $\mathrm{AC}^0{+}\log$ and to logarithmic degree in the polynomial-calculus setting. The accounting keeps total-variation non-expansion and a single $O(\log N)$ prefix-free header visible end to end, avoiding hidden slack.</description>

      <title>The algorithmic regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) &gt; 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta &gt; 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this column, we overview recent progress by many authors on understanding the approximability of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) in low-space streaming models. Inspired by this recent progress, we collate nine conjectural lower bounds against streaming algorithms for CSPs, some of which appear here for the first time.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Eventually Universal Quantum Gate Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Say a collection of $n$-qu$d$it gates $\Gamma$ is eventually universal if and only if there exists $N_0 \geq n$ such that for all $N \geq N_0$, one can approximate any $N$-qu$d$it unitary to arbitrary precision by a circuit over $\Gamma$. In this work, we improve the best known upper bound on the smallest $N_0$ with the above property. Our new bound is roughly $d^4n$, where $d$ is the local dimension (the `$d$' in qu$d$it), whereas the previous bound was roughly $d^8n$. For qubits ($d = 2$), our result implies that if an $n$-qubit gate set is eventually universal, then it will exhibit universality when acting on a $16n$ qubit system, as opposed to the previous bound of a $256n$ qubit system. In other words, if adding just $15n$ ancillary qubits to a quantum system (as opposed to the previous bound of $255 n$ ancillary qubits) does not boost a gate set to universality, then no number of ancillary qubits ever will. Our proof relies on the invariants of finite linear groups as well as a classification result for all finite groups that are unitary $2$-designs.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Stationary Nash Equilibria in Discounted Perfect Information Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing stationary Nash equilibria in discounted perfect information stochastic games from the viewpoint of computational complexity. For two-player games we prove the problem to be in PPAD, which together with a previous PPAD-hardness result precisely classifies the problem as PPAD-complete. In addition to this we give an improved and simpler PPAD-hardness proof for computing a stationary epsilon-Nash equilibrium. For 3-player games we construct games showing that rational-valued stationary Nash equilibria are not guaranteed to exist, and we use these to prove SqrtSum-hardness of computing a stationary Nash equilibrium in 4-player games.</description>

      <title>Power of Counting by Nonuniform Families of Polynomial-Size Finite Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lately, there have been intensive studies on strengths and limitations of nonuniform families of promise decision problems solvable by various types of polynomial-size finite automata families, where ``polynomial-size'' refers to the polynomially-bounded state complexity of a finite automata family. In this line of study, we further expand the scope of these studies to families of partial counting and gap functions, defined in terms of nonuniform families of polynomial-size nondeterministic finite automata, and their relevant families of promise decision problems. Counting functions have an ability of counting the number of accepting computation paths produced by nondeterministic finite automata. With no unproven hardness assumption, we show numerous separations and collapses of complexity classes of those partial counting and gap function families and their induced promise decision problem families. We also investigate their relationships to pushdown automata families of polynomial stack-state complexity.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Communication Complexity of Permutation-Invariant Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives a nearly tight characterization of the quantum communication complexity of the permutation-invariant Boolean functions. With such a characterization, we show that the quantum and randomized communication complexity of the permutation-invariant Boolean functions are quadratically equivalent (up to a logarithmic factor). Our results extend a recent line of research regarding query complexity \cite{AA14, Cha19, BCG+20} to communication complexity, showing symmetry prevents exponential quantum speedups.
  Furthermore, we show the Log-rank Conjecture holds for any non-trivial total permutation-invariant Boolean function. Moreover, we establish a relationship between the quantum/classical communication complexity and the approximate rank of permutation-invariant Boolean functions. This implies the correctness of the Log-approximate-rank Conjecture for permutation-invariant Boolean functions in both randomized and quantum settings (up to a logarithmic factor).</description>

      <title>Circuits and Backdoors: Five Shades of the SETH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is a standard assumption in (fine-grained) parameterized complexity and many tight lower bounds are based on it. We consider a number of reasonable weakenings of the SETH, with sources from (i) circuit complexity (ii) backdoors for SAT-solving (iii) graph width parameters and (iv) weighted satisfiability problems. Our goal is to arrive at formulations which are simultaneously more plausible as hypotheses, but also capture interesting and robust notions of complexity. Using several tools from classical complexity theory we are able to consolidate these numerous hypotheses into a hierarchy of five main equivalence classes of increasing solidity. This framework serves as a step towards structurally classifying a variety of SETH-based lower bounds into intermediate equivalence classes.
  To illustrate the applicability of our framework, for each of our classes we give at least one (non-SAT) problem which is equivalent to the class as a characteristic example application. As our main showcase, we consider a natural parameterization of Independent Set by vertex deletion distance from several standard graph classes. We provide precise characterizations of the difficulty of breaking such bounds, in particular proving that obtaining $(2-\varepsilon)^kn^{O(1)}$ time algorithms for Cograph$+kv$ or Block$+kv$ graphs is equivalent to obtaining a fast satisfiability algorithm for circuits of depth $\varepsilon n$; while solving the weighted version for Interval$+kv$ graphs is equivalent to the (seemingly) harder problem of obtaining a fast satisfiability algorithm for SAT parameterized by a 2-SAT backdoor.</description>

Abstract: In this monograph, we study complexity classes that are defined using $O(\log n)$-space bounded non-deterministic Turing machines. We prove salient results of Computational Complexity in this topic such as the Immerman-Szelepcs$\rm\acute{e}$nyi Theorem, the Isolating Lemma, theorems of Mahajan-Vinay on the determinant and many consequences of these very important results. The manuscript is intended to be a comprehensive textbook on the topic of The Complexity of Logarithmic Space Bounded Counting Classes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lower Bounds by Sample-to-Query Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polynomial method by Beals, Buhrman, Cleve, Mosca, and de Wolf (FOCS 1998, J. ACM 2001), the adversary method by Ambainis (STOC 2000, J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 2002), and the compressed oracle method by Zhandry (CRYPTO 2019) have been shown to be powerful in proving quantum query lower bounds for a wide variety of problems. In this paper, we propose a new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results: 1. A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination. Here, the sample complexity is measured given sample access to the quantum state to be tested, while the query complexity is measured given query access to an oracle that block-encodes the quantum state. 2. A matching lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\beta)$ for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature $\beta$, showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by Gily\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019) is optimal. 3. A new lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for the entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, which was recently studied by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023). 4. A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015, Comm. Math. Phys. 2021). In addition, we also provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>On full-separating sets and related codes in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A domination-based identification problem on a graph $G$ is one where the objective is to choose a subset $C$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that $C$ has both, a domination property, that is, $C$ is either a dominating or a total-dominating set of $G$, and a separation property, that is, any two distinct vertices of $G$ must have distinct closed or open neighborhoods in $C$. Such a set $C$ is often referred to as a code in the literature of identification problems. In this article, we introduce a new separation property, called full-separation, as it combines aspects of the two well-studied properties of closed- and open-separation. We study it in combination with both domination and total-domination and call the resulting codes full-separating dominating codes (or FD-codes for short) and full-separating total-dominating codes (or FTD-codes for short), respectively. Incidentally, FTD-codes have also been introduced in the literature of identification problems under the name of strongly identifying codes (or SID-codes for short) and under a differently formulated definition. In this paper, we address the conditions for the existence of FD- and FTD-codes, bounds for their size, their relation to codes of the other types and present some extremal cases for these bounds and relations. We further show that the problems of determining an FD- or an FTD-code of minimum cardinality in a graph are NP-hard. We also show that the cardinalities of minimum FD- and FTD-codes of any graph differ by at most one, but that it is NP-hard to decide whether or not they are equal for a given graph in general.</description>

Abstract: We show that the class of Kalmar elementary functions can be inductively generated from the addition, the integer remainder and the base-two exponentiation, hence improving previous results by Marchenkov and Mazzanti. We also prove that the substitution basis defined by these three operations is minimal. Furthermore, we discuss alternative substitution bases under arity constraints.</description>

      <title>Curved Boolean Logic: A Contextual Generalization of Propositional Logic with Algorithmic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) generalizes propositional logic by allowing local truth assignments that do not extend to a single global valuation, analogous to curvature in geometry. We give equivalent sheaf and exclusivity-graph semantics and a context-aware proof calculus that is conservative in the flat limit. We formalize CBL-SAT and basic complexity (NP-complete in general) and present operational operators (CBL-AC and CBL-CONS) that prune contradictions earlier on classical hardware. We model noise with iid, AR(1)-correlated, and adversarial bounded perturbations and provide permutation-based significance with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control. A Colab-ready notebook (ancillary files) regenerates all figures and statistics. We position CBL relative to KCBS, CSW, and sheaf frameworks and outline links to SAT/CSP and robustness/adapter stability in large language models.</description>
