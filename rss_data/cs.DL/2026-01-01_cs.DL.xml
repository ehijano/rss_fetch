      <title>Institutional cooperations in Austrian research: An analysis of shared researchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple organisational affiliations are an increasingly common feature of research systems, yet their implications for organisational performance had received limited systematic attention. We developed a scalable, network-based analytical framework that represents simultaneous researcher affiliations as relational links between organisations and applied it to bibliometric data from Austria. Using harmonised publication and affiliation metadata, we constructed two complementary co-affiliation networks: a complete network capturing all simultaneous affiliations and a temporally filtered network retaining only organisational pairs that recurred over time. Network regression analyses showed that geographical proximity remained an important determinant of co-affiliation formation, with spatial distance consistently reducing shared appointments. Clear sectoral differences emerged beyond geography. Universities formed a dense and persistent core of co-affiliations, whereas ties involving medical institutions, government, non-profit and private-sector organisations were often short-lived and attenuated under temporal filtering. Among crosssector links, co-affiliations between universities and research institutes were notably resilient, indicating a more structurally embedded form of organisational integration. We assessed the effect of concurrent affiliations on organisational citation impact across organisational types using field- and year-normalised indicators. Research institutes and universities consistently exhibited higher citation impact than organisations from other sectors, and persistent co-affiliations were associated with greater and more stable scientific visibility.</description>

      <title>To ArXiv or not to ArXiv: A Study Quantifying Pros and Cons of Posting Preprints Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17259</link>

Abstract: Double-blind conferences have engaged in debates over whether to allow authors to post their papers online on arXiv or elsewhere during the review process. Independently, some authors of research papers face the dilemma of whether to put their papers on arXiv due to its pros and cons. We conduct a study to substantiate this debate and dilemma via quantitative measurements. Specifically, we conducted surveys of reviewers in two top-tier double-blind computer science conferences -- ICML 2021 (5361 submissions and 4699 reviewers) and EC 2021 (498 submissions and 190 reviewers). Our three main findings are as follows. First, more than a third of the reviewers self-report searching online for a paper they are assigned to review. Second, conference policies restricting authors from publicising their work on social media or posting preprints before the review process may have only limited effectiveness in maintaining anonymity. Third, outside the review process, we find that preprints from better-ranked institutions experience a very small increase in visibility compared to preprints from other institutions.</description>
