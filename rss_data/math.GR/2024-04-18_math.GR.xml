      <title>From Relation to Emulation and Interpretation: Implementing the Covering Lemma for Finite Transformation Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a computational implementation of the Covering Lemma for finite transformation semigroups. The lemma states that given a surjective relational morphism $(X,S)\twoheadrightarrow(Y,T)$, we can recover the information lost in the morphism and package that into a third transformation semigroup in such a way that a cascade product (subsemigroup of the wreath product) can emulate $(X,S)$, providing a hierarchical way of understanding its structure and dynamics: $(X,S)\hookrightarrow (Y,T)\wr (Z,U)$.
  The implementation complements the existing tools for the holonomy decomposition algorithm as it gives an incremental method to get a coarser decomposition when computing the complete skeleton for holonomy is not feasible. Here we describe a simplified and generalized algorithm for the lemma and compare it to the holonomy method. Incidentally, the computational Covering Lemma could be the easiest way of understanding the hierarchical decompositions of transformation semigroups and thus the celebrated Krohn-Rhodes theory.</description>

      <title>Constructing metric spaces from systems of walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a general procedure for constructing metric spaces from systems of partitions. This generalises and provides analogues of Sageev's construction of dual CAT(0) cube complexes for the settings of hyperbolic and injective metric spaces.
  As applications, we produce a ``universal'' hyperbolic action for groups with strongly contracting elements, and show that many groups with ``coarsely cubical'' features admit geometric actions on injective metric spaces. In an appendix with Davide Spriano, we show that a large class of groups have an infinite-dimensional space of quasimorphisms.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic spaces that detect all strongly-contracting directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a geodesic metric space $X$, we construct a corresponding hyperbolic space, which we call the contraction space, that detects all strongly contracting directions in the following sense; a geodesic in $X$ is strongly contracting if and only if its parametrized image in the contraction space is a quasi-geodesic. If a finitely generated group $G$ acts geometrically on $X$, then all strongly-contracting elements act as WPD elements on the contraction space. If the space $X$ is CAT(0), or more generally Morse-dichotomous, that is if all Morse geodesics are strongly-contracting, then all generalized loxodromics act as WPD elements, implying that the action is what we call ``universally WPD''.</description>

      <title>Unipotent normal subgroups of algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an affine algebraic group scheme over a field $k$. We show there exists a unipotent normal subgroup of $G$ which contains all other such subgroups; we call it the restricted unipotent radical $\mathrm{Rad}_u(G)$ of $G$. We investigate some properties of $\mathrm{Rad}_u(G)$, and study those $G$ for which $\mathrm{Rad}_u(G)$ is trivial. In particular, we relate these notions to their well-known analogues for smooth connected affine $k$-groups.</description>

      <title>From the second BNSR invariant to Dehn functions of coabelian subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finitely presented group $G$ and a surjective homomorphism $G\to \mathbb{Z}^n$ with finitely presented kernel $K$, we give an upper bound on the Dehn function of $K$ in terms of an area-radius pair for $G$. As a consequence we obtain that finitely presented coabelian subgroups of hyperbolic groups have polynomially bounded Dehn function. This generalises results of Gersten and Short and our proof can be viewed as a quantified version of results from Renz' thesis on the second BNSR invariant.</description>

      <title>Internal sequential commutation and single generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract a precise internal description of the sequential commutation equivalence relation introduced in [KEP23] for tracial von Neumann algebras. As an application we prove that if a tracial von Neumann algebra $N$ is generated by unitaries $\{u_i\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ such that $u_i\sim u_j$ (i.e, there exists a finite set of Haar unitaries $\{w_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ in $N^\mathcal{U}$ such that $[u_i, w_1]= [w_k, w_{k+1}]=[w_n,u_j]=0$ for all $1\leq k&lt; n$) then $N$ is singly generated. This generalizes and recovers several known single generation phenomena for II$_1$ factors in the literature with a unified proof.</description>

      <title>Infinite Volume and Infinite Injectivity Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following conjecture of Margulis. Let $G$ be a higher rank simple Lie group and let $\Lambda\le G$ be a discrete subgroup of infinite covolume. Then, the locally symmetric space $\Lambda\backslash G/K$ admits injected balls of any radius. This can be considered as a geometric interpretation of the celebrated Margulis normal subgroup theorem. However, it applies to general discrete subgroups not necessarily associated to lattices. Yet, the result is new even for subgroups of infinite index of lattices. We establish similar results for higher rank semisimple groups with Kazhdan's property (T). We prove a stiffness result for discrete stationary random subgroups in higher rank semisimple groups and a stationary variant of the St\"{u}ck-Zimmer theorem for higher rank semisimple groups with property (T). We also show that a stationary limit of a measure supported on discrete subgroups is almost surely discrete.</description>

      <title>Higher incoherence of the automorphism groups of a free group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F_n$ be the free group on $n \geq 2$ generators. We show that for all $1 \leq m \leq 2n-3$ (respectively for all $1 \leq m \leq 2n-4$) there exists a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)$ (respectively $\operatorname{Out}(F_n)$) which has finiteness of type $F_{m}$ but not of type $FP_{m+1}(\mathbb{Q})$, hence it is not $m$-coherent. In both cases, the new result is the upper bound $m= 2n-3$ (respectively $m = 2n-4$), as it cannot be obtained by embedding direct products of free noncyclic groups, and certifies higher incoherence up to the virtual cohomological dimension and is therefore sharp. As a tool of the proof, we discuss the existence and nature of multiple inequivalent extensions of suitable finite-index subgroups of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_2)$.</description>

      <title>Coarse separation and large-scale geometry of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce and study a natural notion of coarse separation for metric spaces, with an emphasis on coarse separation by subspaces of polynomial or subexponential growth. For instance, we show that symmetric spaces of non-compact type different from $\mathbb{H}_\mathbb{R}^2$ and thick Euclidean buildings of rank $\geq 2$ cannot be coarsely separated by subspaces of subexponential growth; and that a connected nilpotent Lie group of growth degree $D \geq 2$ cannot be coarsely separated by a subspace of polynomial degree $\leq D-2$. We apply these results to the large-scale geometry of amalgamated free products and wreath products. The latter application is based on an Embedding Theorem that generalises previous work of the last two authors, and which is of independent interest. We also discuss some further applications to the distorsion of coarse embeddings between certain metric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00885v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a bimodule of two block algebras of finite groups which has an endopermutation module as a source and which induces a stable equivalence of Morita type gives rise, via slash functors, to a family of bimodules of local block algebras with endopermutation source which induce Morita equivalences. As an application, we show that Morita (resp. stable) equivalences with endopermutation source imply functorial (resp. stable functorial) equivalences defined by Bouc and Y{\i}lmaz.</description>

      <title>Closed 4-braids and the Jones unknot conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jones problem is a question whether there is a non-trivial knot with the trivial Jones polynomial in one variable $q$. The answer to this fundamental question is still unknown despite numerous attempts to explore it. In braid presentation the case of 4-strand braids is already open. S. Bigelow showed in 2000 that if the Burau representation for four-strand braids is unfaithful, then there is an infinite number of non-trivial knots with the trivial two-variable HOMFLY-PT polynomial and hence, with the trivial Jones polynomial, since it is obtained from the HOMFLY-PT polynomial by the specialisation of one of the variables $A=q^2$.
  In this paper, we study four-strand braids and ask whether there are non-trivial knots with the trivial Jones polynomial but a non-trivial HOMFLY-PT polynomial. We have discovered that there is a whole 1-parameter family, parameterised by the writhe number, of 2-variable polynomials that can be HOMFLY-PT polynomials of some knots. We explore various properties of the obtained hypothetical HOMFLY-PT polynomials and suggest several checks to test these formulas. A generalisation is also proposed for the case of a large number of strands.</description>
