      <title>The Neurosymbolic Frontier of Nonuniform Ellipticity: Formalizing Sharp Schauder Theory via Topos-Theoretic Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This white paper presents a critical synthesis of the recent breakthrough in nonuniformly elliptic regularity theory and the burgeoning field of neurosymbolic large reasoning models (LRMs). We explore the resolution of the long-standing sharp growth rate conjecture in Schauder theory, achieved by Cristiana De Filippis and Giuseppe Mingione, which identifies the exact threshold $q/p &lt; 1 + \alpha/n$ for gradient H\"{o}lder continuity. Central to this mathematical achievement is the ``ghost equation'' methodology, a sophisticated auxiliary derivation that bypasses the non-differentiability of classical Euler-Lagrange systems. We propose that the next era of mathematical discovery lies in the integration of these pure analytical constructs with LRMs grounded in topos theory and formal verification frameworks such as Safe and Typed Chain-of-Thought (PC-CoT). By modeling the reasoning process as a categorical colimit in a slice topos, we demonstrate how LRMs can autonomously navigate the ``Dark Side'' of the calculus of variations, providing machine-checkable proofs for regularity bounds in complex, multi-phase physical systems.</description>

      <title>Simple generators of rational function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a subfield of the field of rational functions in several indeterminates. We present an algorithm that, given a set of generators of such a subfield, finds a simple generating set. We provide an implementation of the algorithm and show that it improves upon the state of the art both in efficiency and the quality of the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of simplified generators through several case studies from different application domains, such as structural parameter identifiability. The main algorithmic novelties include performing only partial Gr\"obner basis computation via sparse interpolation and efficient search for polynomials of a fixed degree in a subfield of the rational function field.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Structure in Tensor Decompositions for Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for fast matrix multiplication using tensor decompositions which have special features. Thanks to these features we obtain exponents lower than what the rank of the tensor decomposition suggests. In particular for $6\times 6$ matrix multiplication we reduce the exponent of the recent algorithm by Moosbauer and Poole from $2.8075$ to $2.8016$, while retaining a reasonable leading coefficient.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Simplification Bottleneck in Amortized Neural Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable analytical expressions that accurately describe observed data. Amortized SR promises to be much more efficient than the predominant genetic programming SR methods, but currently struggles to scale to realistic scientific complexity. We find that a key obstacle is the lack of a fast reduction of equivalent expressions to a concise normalized form. Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark. Moreover, it performs on par with state-of-the-art direct optimization (PySR) while recovering more concise instead of more complex expressions with increasing inference budget.</description>
