      <title>On $*$-Clean Group Rings over SLC-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The property of $*$-cleanness in group rings has been studied for some groups considering the classical involution, given by $g^*=g^{-1}$. A group is called an SLC-group if its quotient by its center is isomorphic to the Klein group; these groups are equipped with its own canonical involution, which usually does not coincide with the classical one. In this paper we study the $*$-cleanness of $RG$ when $G$ is an SLC-group, considering $*$ as its canonical involution. In that context, we prove that if $RG$ is $*$-clean then $G$ is the direct product of $Q_8$ and an abelian group with some extra properties and we find a converse for some specific cases, generalizing a result by Gao, Chen and Li for $Q_8$.</description>

      <title>New Lie algebras over the group $\mathbb Z_2^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new structure, based on joining copies of a group by means of a \emph{twist}, has recently been considered to describe the brackets of the two exceptional real Lie algebras of type $G_2$ in a highly symmetric way. In this work we show that these are not isolated examples, providing a wide range of Lie algebras which are generalized group algebras over the group $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$. On the one hand, some orthogonal Lie algebras are quite naturally generalized group algebras over such group. On the other hand, previous classifications on graded contractions can be applied to this context getting many more examples, involving solvable and nilpotent Lie algebras of dimensions 32, 28, 24, 21, 16 and 14.</description>

Abstract: This article introduces the $m, n)$-seminearring structure, which is a generalization of $(m, n)$-semiring. This research aims to develop theories of $(m, n)$-seminearring. In particular, the concepts of $(m, n)$-seminearring, $(m, n)$-subseminearring, $(m, n)$-ideal, $(m, n)$-seminearring with unity, homomorphism of $(m, n)$-seminearrings, construction of factor $(m, n)$-seminearring of $(m, n)$-seminearring by congruence relation, and some of its exciting properties are given. The method used in this study is to adopt the theory in $(m, n)$-semiring.</description>

      <title>Artin-Schelter Gorenstein property of Hopf Galois extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the homological properties of the faithfully flat Hopf Galois extension $A \subseteq B$. It establishes that when $B$ is a noetherian affine PI algebra and $A$ is AS Gorenstein, $B$ inherits the AS Gorenstein property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that injective dimension serves as a monoidal invariant for AS Gorenstein Hopf algebras. Specifically, if two such Hopf algebras have equivalent monoidal categories of comodules, then their injective dimensions are equal.</description>

      <title>Skew Calabi-Yau property of faithfully flat Hopf Galois extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that if $H$ is a Hopf algebra and $A \subseteq B$ is a faithfully flat $H$-Galois extension, then $B$ is skew Calabi-Yau provided $A$ and $H$ are. Specifically, for cleft extensions $A \subseteq B$, the Nakayama automorphism of $B$ can be derived from those of $A$ and $H$, along with the homological determinant of the $H$-action on $A$. This finding is based on the study of the Hopf bimodule structure on $\mathrm{Ext}^i_{A^e}(A, B^e)$.</description>

      <title>Existence of polynomials with given roots over non-commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the question of existence of polynomials with given roots over associative non-commutative rings with identity. It is shown that in the case of an associative division ring for arbitrary n elements of this ring there exists a polynomial of degree n whose roots are these elements. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a polynomial are also obtained in the case of an arbitrary (not necessarily division) associative ring with identity. The case of polynomials defined over a matrix ring over a field is considered separately; for such polynomials a criterion for the existence of a second-degree polynomial with given roots is obtained; examples of constructing polynomials with given roots are also given.</description>

      <title>On semicommutativity of rings relative to hypercenter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Armendariz and semicommutative rings are generalizations of reduced rings. In \cite{IN}, I.N. Herstein introduced the notion of a hypercenter of a ring to generalize the center subclass. For a ring $R$, an element $a \in R$ is called hypercentral if $ax^{n}=x^{n}a$ for all $x \in R$ and for some $n=n(x,a) \in \mathbb{N}$. Motivated by this definition, we introduce $\mathscr{H}$-Semicommutative rings as a generalization of semicommutative rings and investigate their relations with other classes of rings. We have proven that the class of $\mathscr{H}$-Semicommutative rings lies strictly between Zero-Insertive rings (ZI) and Abelian rings. Additionally, we have demonstrated that if $R$ is $\mathscr{H}$-semicommutative, then for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the matrix subring $S_{n}^{'}(R)$ is also $\mathscr{H}$-semicommutative. Among other significant results, we have established that if $R$ is $\mathscr{H}$-semicommutative and left $SF$, then $R$ is strongly regular. We have also shown that $\mathscr{H}$-semicommutative rings are 2-primal, providing sufficient conditions for a ring $R$ to be nil-singular. Additionally, we have proven that if every simple singular module over $R$ is wnil-injective and $R$ is $\mathscr{H}$-semicommutative, then $R$ is reduced. Furthermore, we have studied the relationship of $\mathscr{H}$-semicommutative rings with the classes of Baer, Quasi-Baer, p.p. rings, and p.q. rings in this article, and we have provided some more relevant results.</description>

      <title>Comparing $\tau$-tilting modules and $1$-tilting modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize $\tau$-tilting modules as $1$-tilting modules over quotient algebras satisfying a tensor-vanishing condition, and characterize $1$-tilting modules as $\tau$-tilting modules satisfying a ${\rm Tor}^1$-vanishing condition. We use delooping levels to study \emph{Self-orthogonal $\tau$-tilting Conjecture}: any self-orthogonal $\tau$-tilting module is $1$-tilting. We confirm the conjecture when the endomorphism algebra of the module has finite global delooping level.</description>

      <title>Frobenius-Schur Indicators of Dual Fusion Categories and Semisimple Partially Dualized Quasi-Hopf Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frobenius-Schur indicators of objects in pivotal monoidal categories were defined and formulated by Ng and Schauenburg in 2007. In this paper, we introduce and study an analogous formula for indicators in the dual category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^\ast$ to a spherical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ (with respect to an indecomposable semisimple module category $\mathcal{M}$) over $\mathbb{C}$. Our main theorem is a relation between indicators of specific objects in $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^\ast$ and $\mathcal{C}$. As consequences: 1) We obtain equalities on the indicators between certain representations and the exponents of a semisimple complex Hopf algebra as well as its partially dualized quasi-Hopf algebra; 2) We show that the property in Kashina's conjecture on the exponent holds for a class of semisimple Hopf algebras fitting into abelian extensions with assumptions weaker than split.</description>

      <title>Resolution of singularities via Tannaka duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving finite quotient singularities is a classical problem in algebraic geometry. Traditional methods of Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) translate the singularity into a quiver representation space and take the GIT quotient with respect to a generic stability parameter. While this approach easily produces smooth resolutions, it fails to produce any stacky resolutions, as quiver representation spaces lack finite stabilizers.
  This paper provides an alternative framework which produces both smooth and stacky resolutions. Our framework is based on a trick of Abdelgadir and Segal, which deploys Tannaka duality to describe the points of the classifying stack of a finite group in terms of algebraic data. Abdelgadir and Segal successfully pursue this strategy and obtain smooth and stacky resolutions in the Kleinian $ D_4 $ case. We generalize this strategy to all Kleinian singularities and obtain a series of varieties which we refer to as Clebsch-Gordan varieties. We provide tools to work with these Clebsch-Gordan varieties, analyze their stable loci with respect to different stability parameters, and study the Kleinian $ A_n $ and $ D_n $ cases in detail.</description>

Abstract: We classify order $3$ linear difference operators over $\mathbb{C}(x)$ that are solvable in terms of lower order difference operators. To prove this result, we introduce the notion of absolute irreducibility for difference modules, and classify (for arbitrary order) modules that are irreducible but not absolutely irreducible.</description>

      <title>Commutators and products of Lie ideals of prime rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MMotivated by some recent results on Lie ideals, it is proved that if $L$ is a Lie ideal of a simple ring $R$ with center $Z(R)$, then $L\subseteq Z(R)$, $L=Z(R)a+Z(R)$ for some noncentral $a\in L$, or $[R, R]\subseteq L$, which gives a generalization of a classical theorem due to Herstein. We also study commutators and products of noncentral Lie ideals of prime rings. Precisely, let $R$ be a prime ring with extended centroid $C$. We completely characterize Lie ideals $L$ and elements $a$ of $R$ such that $L+aL$ contains a nonzero ideal of $R$. Given noncentral Lie ideals $K, L$ of $R$, it is proved that $[K, L]=0$ if and only if $KC=LC=Ca+C$ for any noncentral element $a\in L$. As a consequence, we characterize noncentral Lie ideals $K_1,\ldots,K_m$ with $m\geq 2$ such that $K_1K_2\cdots K_m$ contains a nonzero ideal of $R$. Finally, we characterize noncentral Lie ideals $K_j$'s and $L_k$'s satisfying $\big[K_1K_2\cdots K_m, L_1L_2\cdots L_n\big]=0$ from the viewpoint of centralizers.</description>

      <title>Strongly Positive Semi-Definite Tensors and Strongly SOS Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce {odd-order} strongly PSD (positive semi-definite) tensors which map real vectors to nonnegative vectors. We then introduce odd-order strongly SOS (sum-of-squares) tensors. A strongly SOS tensor maps real vectors to nonnegative vectors whose components are all SOS polynomials. Strongly SOS tensors are strongly PSD tensors. Odd order completely positive tensors are strongly SOS tensors. We also introduce strict Hankel tensors, which are also strongly SOS tensors. Odd order Hilbert tensors are strict Hankel tensors. However, the Laplacian tensor of a uniform hypergraph may not be strongly PSD. This motivates us to study wider PSD-like tensors. A cubic tensor is said to be a generalized PSD tensor if its corresponding symmetrization tensor has no negative H-eigenvalue. In the odd order case, this extension contains a peculiar tensor class, whose members have no H-eigenvalues at all. We call such tensors barren tensors, and the other generalized PSD symmetric tensors genuinely PSD symmetric tensors. In the odd order case, genuinely PSD tensors embrace various useful structured tensors, such as strongly PSD tensors, symmetric M-tensors and Laplacian tensors of uniform hypergraphs. However, there are exceptions. It is known an even order symmetric B-tensor is a PSD tensor. We give an example of an odd order symmetric B-tensor, which is a barren tensor.</description>

Abstract: We study unital commutative associative algebras and their associated n-Lie algebras, showing that they are strong transposed Poisson $n$-Lie algebras under specific compatibility conditions. Furthermore, we generalize the simplicity criterion for transposed Poisson algebras, proving that a transposed Poisson $n$-Lie algebra is simple if and only if its associated $n$-Lie algebra is simple. In addition, we study the strong condition for transposed Poisson $n$-Lie algebras, proving that it fails in the case of a free transposed Poisson 3-Lie algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of extensions of associative algebras, which we refer to as ``strongly proj-bounded extensions''. We prove that the finiteness of the left global dimension and the support of the Hochschild homology is preserved by strongly proj-bounded extensions, generalizing results of Cibils, Lanzillota, Marcos and Solotar. Moreover, we show that the finiteness of the big left finitistic dimension is preserved by strongly proj-bounded extensions. In order to construct examples, we describe a new class of extensions of algebras of finite relative global dimension, which may be of independent interest. The results apply both for abstract (meaning no topology) and pseudocompact algebras.</description>

      <title>A New Formula for the Determinant and Bounds on Its Tensor and Waring Ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new explicit formula for the determinant that contains superexponentially fewer terms than the usual Leibniz formula. As an immediate corollary of our formula, we show that the tensor rank of the $n \times n$ determinant tensor is no larger than the $n$-th Bell number, which is much smaller than the previously best known upper bounds when $n \geq 4$. Over fields of non-zero characteristic we obtain even tighter upper bounds, and we also slightly improve the known lower bounds. In particular, we show that the $4 \times 4$ determinant over $\mathbb{F}_2$ has tensor rank exactly equal to $12$. Our results also improve upon the best known upper bound for the Waring rank of the determinant when $n \geq 17$, and lead to a new family of axis-aligned polytopes that tile $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>F-invariant in cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the $F$-invariant in cluster algebras using tropicalization. This is an analog of the $E$-invariant introduced by Derksen, Weyman and Zelevinsky in the additive categorification of cluster algebras and the $\mathfrak{d}$-invariant introduced by Kang, Kashiwara, Kim and Oh in the monoidal categorification of (quantum) cluster algebras. We prove that the product of two cluster monomials is still a cluster monomial if and only if their $F$-invariant is zero. For cluster algebras with a compatible Poisson bracket, we prove that if two cluster variables are log-cannonical, then they are contained in the same cluster.
  Inspired by $F$-invariant, we introduce the dominant sets for seeds of cluster algebras as an replacement of torsion classes for $\tau$-tilting pairs in $\tau$-tilting theory. With the help of the dominant sets, we prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras are acyclic. In particular, this implies that green mutations induce a partial order on the set of seeds (up to seed equivalence) of cluster algebras. We show that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras coincide with the Hasse quivers of the above posets of seeds.</description>

      <title>Kronecker coefficients and Harrison centers of the representation ring of the symmetric group in dimension six</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of the representation ring of the symmetric group in dimension six. The Kronecker coefficients and all power formulas of irreducible representations of $S_6$ are computed using the character theory of finite groups. In addition, by direct sum decomposition of tensor products of different irreducible representations of $S_6$, we characterise generators of the representation ring $\mathcal{R}(S_6)$, show that its unit group $U(\mathcal{R}(S_6))$ is a Klein four-group and related results on the structure of primitive idempotents. Furthermore, we introduce Harrison center theory to study the representation ring and show that the Harrison center of the cubic form induced by the generating relations of $\mathcal{R}(S_6)$ is isomorphic to itself. Finally, we conclude with some open problems for future consideration.</description>
