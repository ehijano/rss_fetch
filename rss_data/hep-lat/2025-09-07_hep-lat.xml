      <title>Parton physics from a heavy-quark operator product expansion: Lattice QCD calculation of the fourth moment of the pion distribution amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) is an essential non-perturbative input for a range of high-energy exclusive processes in quantum chromodynamics. Building on our previous work, the continuum limit of the fourth Mellin moment of the pion LCDA is determined in quenched QCD using quark masses which correspond to a pion mass of $m_\pi = 550$ MeV. This calculation finds $\langle\xi^2\rangle = 0.202(8)(9)$ and $\langle \xi^4 \rangle = 0.039(28)(11)$ where the first error indicates the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty from the analysis and the second indicates the uncertainty from working with Wilson coefficients computed to next-to-leading order. These results are presented in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at a renormalization scale of $\mu = 2$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Non-singlet conserved charges and anomalies in 3+1 D staggered fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the 3+1 D staggered fermion Hamiltonian possesses, in addition to the conserved charge $Q_0$ that generates the vector $\mathrm{U}(1)_V$ transformation, conserved charges $Q_F$ that generate the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ transformations in the continuum limit, acting simultaneously on left- and right-handed Weyl fermions in opposite directions. Each conserved charge $Q_F$ can be regarded as the generator of a $\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_L \times \mathrm{SU}(2)_R \times \mathrm{U}(1)_A$. One of these lattice charges satisfies the Onsager algebra. On the lattice, the charges $Q_F$ do not commute with $Q_0$, and no symmetric mass term exists that commutes with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$. This signals the presence of a mixed anomaly. Remarkably, however, in the continuum limit, a symmetric mass term commuting with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$ can be constructed. % This implies that the non-trivial lattice anomaly becomes a trivial anomaly in the continuum QFT. This means that the mixed anomaly that is nontrivial on the lattice becomes trivial in the IR QFT obtained in the continuum limit, which is consistent with the analysis of the Ward--Takahashi (WT) identity on the lattice. Indeed, by evaluating this identity associated with the $\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ transformation on the lattice, we confirm that $\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ symmetry is exactly conserved.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic meson masses from the Curci-Ferrari model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mass spectrum of nonrelativistic mesons composed of charm and bottom quarks within the framework of the Curci-Ferrari model in the Landau gauge, focusing on the influence of the gluon mass on our results. We derive the Hamiltonian from the scattering amplitude of a single massive gluon exchange. By incorporating a confining Cornell potential we solve the Schr\"odinger equation for the dominant terms of the Hamiltonian, which include the kinetic energy and a Yukawa-type potential. Corrections to the energy are then introduced perturbatively. By studying the parameter space of the model we fit the experimental mass spectrum of charmonium, bottomonium and charm-bottom mesons. From the five parameters of our approach, we allow the gluon mass and the gauge coupling to run with the energy scale according to the ultraviolet one-loop renormalization flows, computed in [1]. Our results show very good agreement with the data, suggesting that a nonvanishing gluon mass provides a better description of the spectrum of heavy mesons than the massless case.</description>

      <title>New phases in QCD at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the phases of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature and baryon density is crucial for describing matter in heavy-ion collisions and the interior of neutron stars. While the transition from the confined phase to the deconfined phase has been extensively studied at vanishing chemical potential, recent theoretical work suggests the existence of intermediate phases with partial deconfinement, where only a subset of the color degrees of freedom is deconfined. In this paper, we study the generalization of partial deconfinement in QCD in the Veneziano large-$N_{\rm c}$ limit ($N_{\rm f}/N_{\rm c}$ fixed) to finite baryon chemical potential. We find that the partially deconfined phase has finer structure, and hence that there are four phases in QCD at finite temperature and moderately large chemical potential: complete confinement, complete deconfinement, and two kinds of partial deconfinement. A key ingredient is the refined understanding of the meaning of the 'Gross-Witten-Wadia point', i.e., the opening of a gap in the distribution of Polyakov line phases: either string condensation or baryon condensation causes the GWW transition. As a by-product, we observe the emergence of the QCD critical point from the interplay between baryon condensation and partial deconfinement. While our approach is necessarily qualitative due to the fermion sign problem, it provides a unified theoretical framework for understanding the rich phase structure of dense QCD matter and offers new perspectives on the location and nature of the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized twist-3 parton distribution functions $f_{LT}(x)$ for the spin-1 deuteron by using twist-2 relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor-polarized twist-3 parton distribution functions (PDFs) $f_{LT}(x)$ are calculated for the spin-1 deuteron by using twist-2 relations, which are similar to the Wandzura-Wilczek relation and the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule in the spin-1/2 nucleon, together with tensor-polarized twist-2 PDFs $f_{1LL}(x)$. The PDFs are shown for $f_{LT}(x)$ at $Q^2 =2.5$ GeV$^2$, where the tensor-polarized PDFs $f_{1LL}(x)$ are provided. The $x$-dependence of $f_{LT}(x)$ is similar to $f_{1LL}(x)$, and the magnitude of $f_{LT}(x)$ is roughly of the order of $f_{1LL}(x)$. In experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab), higher-twist effects could be sizable because $Q^2$ values are not very large in comparison with the hadronic scale of 1 GeV$^2$. Therefore, the JLab experiments could provide a good opportunity to investigate the twist-3 distributions $f_{LT}(x)$ in addition to the twist-2 ones $f_{1LL}(x)$. Furthermore, these tensor-polarized PDFs could be investigated at future Electron-Ion Colliders (EICs) and hadron accelerator facilities such as the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA), and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</description>

      <title>Quantum simulations of quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the quantum computing method has been used to address the sign problem in traditional Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulations. We propose that the Coulomb gauge (CG) should be used in quantum simulations of LGT. This is because the redundant degrees of freedom can be eliminated in CG. Therefore, the Hamiltonian in CG does not need to be gauge invariance, allowing the gauge field to be discretized naively. We point out that discretized gauge fields and fermion fields should be placed on momentum and position lattices, respectively. Under this scheme, the CG condition and Gauss's law can be conveniently preserved by solving algebraic equations of polarization vectors. We also discuss the procedure for mapping gauge fields to qubits, and then demonstrate the polynomial scaling of qubits and the complexity of time evolution. Finally, we calculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the U(1) plaquette operator and the Wilson loop on a classical device to test the performance of our discretization scheme.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Muon Anomaly from $e^+ e^-\to$ Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18239v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly) from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below the $\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and the QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces: $a_\mu\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\pm 37)\times 10^{-11} $.A comparison with previous data driven ($e^+e^-$ and $\tau$-decays) estimates is done.Including the Higher Order $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the Hadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW) contributions, one obtains: $\Delta a_\mu^{pheno}\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{pheno}= (81\pm 41)\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent experimental value $a_\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates the previous one in Ref.[1], after adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions, and can be compared with the one from the most precise Lattice result $\Delta a_\mu^{lattice}= (90\pm 56)\times 10^{-11}$. Then, we deduce the (tentative) SM prediction average : $\Delta a_\mu^{SM} = (87\pm 33)\times 10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by revising our predictions on the LO HVP contributions in adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions to the ones in Ref.[1]. Then, we obtain: $a_\tau\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3516\pm 25)\times 10^{-11} $ and $\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2770.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-5}$ for 5 flavours.</description>
