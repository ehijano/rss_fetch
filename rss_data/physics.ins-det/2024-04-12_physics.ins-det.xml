      <title>Miniaturized time-correlated single-photon counting module for time-of-flight non-line-of-sight imaging applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon time-of-flight (TOF) non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging enables the high-resolution reconstruction of objects outside the field of view. The compactness of TOF NLOS imaging systems, entailing the miniaturization of key components within such systems is crucial for practical applications. Here, we present a miniaturized four-channel time-correlated single-photon counting module dedicated to TOF NLOS imaging applications. The module achieves excellent performance with a 10 ps bin size and 27.4 ps minimum root-mean-square time resolution. We present the results of TOF NLOS imaging experiment using an InGaAs/InP single-photon detector and the time-correlated single-photon counting module, and show that a 6.3 cm lateral resolution and 2.3 cm depth resolution can be achieved under the conditions of 5 m imaging distance and 1 ms pixel dwell time.</description>

      <title>8x8 Patch-Antenna-Coupled TeraFET Detector Array for Terahertz Quantum-Cascade-Laser Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithically integrated, antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) constitute rapid and sensitive detectors for the terahertz range (0.3 THz to 10 THz) that can operate at room temperature. Here, we conducted an experimental characterization of a single patch-antenna coupled TeraFET optimized for 3.4 THz operation. This characterization utilized a single-mode high-power terahertz Quantum-Cascade-Laser (QCL) emitting at the designated frequency (2.85 THz and 3.4 THz). Subsequently, we integrated 8x8 of the TeraFET elements into a parallel readout circuitry, facilitated by the process maturity of a commercial 65-nm process node. In this configuration, the entire TeraFET network operates as a unified pixel, amalgamating the output signals of all rectifying elements. We emphasize two significant enhancements for sensitive power detection experiments. Firstly, the larger detector area enhances alignment and signal stability. Additionally, it leads to a significantly reduced source--drain resistance, resulting in lower noise and enabling higher modulation bandwidth. In the following, we introduce a TeraFET-based detector system implementation achieving a bandwidth of 15 MHz. Furthermore, we show potential to extend achievable bandwidth up to 21 MHz . Finally, we validate the system's performance by employing high-resolution spectroscopic data to investigate methanol vapor in the vicinity of 3.4 THz with an estimated detection limit of 2.6e11 molecules/cm3.</description>

      <title>Towards a realistic noise modelling of quantum sensors for future satellite gravity missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold Atom Interferometry accelerometers and gradiometers have emerged as promising candidates for future gravimetric satellite missions due to their potential for detecting gravitational forces and gradients with high precision and accuracy. Mapping the Earth's gravity field from space offers valuable insights into climate change, hydro- and biosphere evolution, and seismic activity prediction. Current satellite gravimetry missions have demonstrated the utility of gravity data in understanding global mass transport phenomena, climate dynamics, and geological processes. However, state-of-the-art measurement techniques face noise and long-term drift limitations, which might propagate on the recovery of Earth's time-varying gravity field. Quantum sensors, particularly atom interferometry-based devices, offer promise for improving the accuracy and stability of space-based gravity measurements. This study explores the sensitivity of CAI accelerometers and gradiometers. We explore the low-low satellite-to-satellite and gravity gradiometry measurements to build analytical models of measurements and associated errors. We selected an ambitious scenario for CAI parameters that illustrates a potential path for increasing instrument accuracies and capabilities for space gravimetry. Two operational modes, concurrent and sequential, are compared to mitigate the effects of inaccurately known attitude rates on Coriolis accelerations. The sequential mode shows the potential to reduce these effects, enabling accurate measurements for low-low Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking missions in the near future. Attitude determination is discussed, highlighting the importance of accurate measurements to reconstruct Coriolis accelerations and related to errors in the reference frame rotation from body or local frames to the Earth co-rotating frame.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present an interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of statistical power offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>Optical cavity characterization with a mode-matched heterodyne sensing scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a technique for measuring the complex reflectivity of an optical cavity with a resonant local oscillator laser and an auxiliary probe laser, each coupled via opposite ends of the cavity. A heterodyne sensing scheme is then used to observe the phase and amplitude of the interference beat-note between the promptly reflected field and the cavity transmitted field injected through the far mirror. Since the local oscillator laser must pass through the cavity before interfering with the probe laser these measurements are not only independent of the spatial coupling of either laser to the cavity, but also obtained at the in-situ position of the cavity Eigenmode. This technique was demonstrated on a 19 m cavity to measure the individual transmissivities of each of the mirrors as well as the round trip optical losses to an accuracy of several parts per million.</description>

      <title>Si Superstrate Lenses on Patch-Antenna-Coupled TeraFETs: NEP Optimization and Frequency Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study on performance optimization and resonant frequency modification of terahertz detectors by the use of hyper-hemispherical silicon superstrate lenses. The detectors are patch-TeraFETs, i.e., field-effect transistors with monolithically integrated patch antennas fabricated with a commercial 65-nm CMOS foundry process and designed for an operation frequency of 580 GHz. We demonstrate a strong improvement of the optical noise-equivalent power optical NEP, referenced against the total radiation power) reaching a value of 16 pW/Hz^(1/2). We show, furthermore, that the resonance frequency can be efficiently fine-tuned by the choice of the material and the thickness of a dielectric layer placed between the transistor and the superstrate lens. The resonance frequency can be shifted by more than 15 % of the center frequency (up to 100 GHz for the 580 GHz devices). The design of the on-chip optics can be employed for post-fabrication tailoring of the detector's resonance frequency to target specific spectral positions.</description>

      <title>Silicon-Photomultiplier (SiPM) Protection Against Over-Current and Over-Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SiPMs operate in Geiger mode, wherein photodiode cells are reverse-biased to the breakdown by even a single photon. Each cell is connected in series with a quenching resistor, which prevents cell damage and resets the cell after making a signal. All cells are arranged in parallel, making SiPMs and biasing circuits vulnerable to over-illumination, where the current passing through the SiPM can exceed the allowable value, leading to damage. In this study, we investigate over-current conditions in SiPMs and propose a protective method against over-illumination and over-current using a series resistor. Additionally, we ensure SiPM stability through the incorporation of a suitable capacitor.</description>

      <title>Spin-Energy Entanglement of a Time-Focused Neutron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable a new class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable novel approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>

      <title>Skipper-CCD Sensors for the Oscura Experiment: Requirements and Preliminary Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oscura is a proposed multi-kg skipper-CCD experiment designed for a dark matter (DM) direct detection search that will reach unprecedented sensitivity to sub-GeV DM-electron interactions with its 10 kg detector array. Oscura is planning to operate at SNOLAB with 2070 m overburden, and aims to reach a background goal of less than one event in each electron bin in the 2-10 electron ionization-signal region for the full 30 kg-year exposure, with a radiation background rate of 0.01 dru. In order to achieve this goal, Oscura must address each potential source of background events, including instrumental backgrounds. In this work, we discuss the main instrumental background sources and the strategy to control them, establishing a set of constraints on the sensors' performance parameters. We present results from the tests of the first fabricated Oscura prototype sensors, evaluate their performance in the context of the established constraints and estimate the Oscura instrumental background based on these results.</description>

      <title>A method to observe field-region oxide charge and inter-electrode isolation from $CV$-characteristics of $n$-on-$p$ devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04365v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $N$-on-$p$ silicon sensors will be utilized in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector's tracker and High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) in the High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Among their several advantages in terms of radiation hardness over the traditional $p$-on-$n$ sensors in the extreme radiation environment of the HL-LHC are electron collection instead of holes and overlapping maxima of weighting and electric fields at the charge-collecting electrodes. The disadvantage of the multi-channel SiO$_2$-passivated $n$-on-$p$ sensors is the generation of an inversion layer under the Si/SiO$_2$-interface by a positive interface-oxide-charge ($N_\textrm{ox}$) that at high densities can compromise the position resolution by creating a conduction channel between the electrodes. This issue is typically addressed by including additional isolation implants ($p$-stop, $p$-spray) between $n^+$-electrodes. Focusing on the guard-ring regions of $n$-on-$p$ sensors where no isolation implants are applied between the electrodes, a capacitance-voltage ($CV$) characterization study of both 6-inch wafer test diodes and 8-inch HGCAL prototype and pre-series sensors showed a distinct threshold voltage ($V_\textrm{th,iso}$) in the $CV$-characteristics of a biased $n^+$-electrode when its enclosing guard-ring was left floating. When reproduced by simulations, the measured $V_\textrm{th,iso}$ was found to contain information on the field-region $N_\textrm{ox}$ and indicate the threshold where the two electrodes become electrically isolated by the influence of the reverse bias voltage. Together with previous studies on the inter-electrode isolation of irradiated $n$-on-$p$ sensors, the results indicate that position sensitive $n$-on-$p$ sensors without isolation implants may be feasible in future HEP experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling of antenna-coupled Si MOSFETs in the Terahertz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the modeling and experimental characterization of Si CMOS detectors of terahertz radiation based on antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs). The detectors are manufactured using TSMC's 65-nm technology. We apply two models -- the TSMC RF foundry model and our own ADS-HDM -- to simulate the Si CMOS TeraFET performance and compare their predictions with respective experimental data. Both models are implemented in the commercial circuit simulation software Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS). We find that the compact model TSMC RF is capable to predict the detector responsivity and its dependence on frequency and gate voltage with good accuracy up to the highest frequency of 1.2 THz covered in this study. This frequency is well beyond the tool's intended operation range for 5G communications and 110-GHz millimeter wave applications. We demonstrate that our self-developed physics-based ADS-HDM tool, which relies on an extended one-dimensional hydrodynamic transport model and can be adapted readily to other material technologies, has high predictive qualities comparable to those of the foundry model. We use the ADS-HDM to discuss the contribution of diffusive and plasmonic effects to the THz response of Si CMOS TeraFETs, finding that these effects, while becoming more significant with rising frequency, are never dominant. Finally, we estimate that the electrical NEP (perfect power coupling conditions) is on the order of 5 pW/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at room-temperature.</description>
