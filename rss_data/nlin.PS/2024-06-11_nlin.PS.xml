      <title>Solitary waves and kinks in FPU lattices with soft-hard-soft trilinear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a version of the classical Hamiltonian Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) problem with a trilinear force-strain relation of soft-hard-soft type that is in general non-symmetric. In addition to the classical spatially localized solitary waves, such hardening-softening model also exhibits supersonic kinks and finite-amplitude, spatially delocalized flat-top solitary waves that acquire the structure of a kink-antikink bundle when their velocity approaches the kink limit. Exploiting the fact that traveling waves are periodic modulo shift by a lattice spacing, we compute these solutions as fixed points of the corresponding nonlinear map and investigate how their properties depend on the parameter measuring the asymmetry of the problem. In a particularly interesting case when one of the soft regimes has zero elastic modulus, we obtain explicit solutions for sufficiently slow solitary waves. In contrast to conventional delocalization in the sonic limit, these compact structures mounted on a constant background become localized at the lattice scale as their velocity tends to zero. Numerical simulations of Riemann-type initial value problem in this degenerate model show the emergence of Whitham shocks that involve periodic trains of solitary waves. We investigate stability of the obtained solutions using direct numerical simulations and Floquet analysis. We also obtain explicit solutions for a quasicontinuum model that captures some important features of the discrete problem.</description>

      <title>A Turing-based bimodal population code can specify Cephalopod chromatic skin displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The skin of a cephalopod forms a dazzling array of patterns made by chromatophores, elastic sacs of pigment that can be expanded by muscles to reveal their color. Tens of thousands of these chromatophores can work together to generate a stable display of stripes, spots, mottled grainy camouflage, or dynamic oscillations and traveling waves of activation. How does a neuromuscular system organize the coactivation of thousands of degrees of freedom through simple central commands? We provide a minimally-complex physiologically-plausible mathematical model, using Turing's morphogenetic equations, that can generate the array of twelve static and four dynamic types of skin displays seen in several cephalopod species. These equations specify how muscle cells on the skin need to locally interact for the global chromatic patterns to be formed. We also demonstrate a link between Turing neural computations and the asynchronous type of computing that has been extensively demonstrated in brain systems: population coding, using bimodal codes, with the relative heights of the modes specifying the kind of global pattern generated. Since Cephalopod skins are a "visible neural net", we believe that the computational principles uncovered through their study may have wider implications for the functioning of other neural systems.</description>

      <title>Modulational Instability of the time-fractional Ivancevic option pricing model and the Coupled Nonlinear volatility and option price model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time-fractional Ivancevic option pricing model and the coupled nonlinear volatility and option price model via both modulational instability (MI) analysis and direct simulations. For the coupled volatility and option pricing model the coupling term for both the volatility and the option price equation is the same, the MI results are dependent on it, and the stability of the volatility exists for the same condition as that of the price. The numerical simulations are done to confirm the conditions of MI. For the time-fractional model the analysis shows that for some values of the Hurst exponent MI exists for negative values of the adaptive market heat potential. Also, the sign of the volatility does not affect the MI, even though for some values of the volatility the MI can be suppressed. Direct numerical simulation shows the existance of solitons for negative values of the adaptive market potential where instabilty exists due to the value of the Hurst exponent.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction explains chimera shape: when multi-body interaction matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for networks, deriving the second-order phase approximation for a paradigmatic model of oscillatory networks - an ensemble of non-identical Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled pairwisely via an arbitrary coupling matrix. We explicitly demonstrate how this matrix translates into the coupling structure in the phase equations. To illustrate the power of our approach and the crucial importance of high-order phase reduction, we tackle a trendy setup of non-locally coupled oscillators exhibiting a chimera state. We reveal that our second-order phase model reproduces the dependence of the chimera shape on the coupling strength that is not captured by the typically used first-order Kuramoto-like model. Our derivation contributes to a better understanding of complex networks' dynamics, establishing a relation between the coupling matrix and multi-body interaction terms in the high-order phase model.</description>

      <title>Self-Reproduction and Evolution in Cellular Automata: 25 Years after Evoloops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The year of 2024 marks the 25th anniversary of the publication of evoloops, an evolutionary variant of Chris Langton's self-reproducing loops which proved constructively that Darwinian evolution of self-reproducing organisms by variation and natural selection is possible within deterministic cellular automata. Over the last few decades, this line of Artificial Life research has since undergone several important developments. Although it experienced a relative dormancy of activities for a while, the recent rise of interest in open-ended evolution and the success of continuous cellular automata models have brought researchers' attention back to how to make spatio-temporal patterns self-reproduce and evolve within spatially distributed computational media. This article provides a review of the relevant literature on this topic over the past 25 years and highlights the major accomplishments made so far, the challenges being faced, and promising future research directions.</description>
