      <title>Assessing the Potential Impact of Direction-Dependent HRTF Selection on Sound Localization Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the approach of direction-dependent selection of Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) and its impact on sound localization accuracy. For applications such as virtual reality (VR) and teleconferencing, obtaining individualized HRTFs can be beneficial yet challenging, the objective of this work is therefore to assess whether incorporating HRTFs in a direction-dependent manner could improve localization precision without the need to obtain individualized HRTFs. A localization experiment conducted with a VR headset assessed localization errors, comparing an overall best HRTF from a set, against selecting the best HRTF based on average performance in each direction. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement in elevation localization error with the method motivated by direction-dependent HRTF selection, while revealing insignificant differences in azimuth errors.</description>

      <title>Preserving spoken content in voice anonymisation with character-level vocoder conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice anonymisation can be used to help protect speaker privacy when speech data is shared with untrusted others. In most practical applications, while the voice identity should be sanitised, other attributes such as the spoken content should be preserved. There is always a trade-off; all approaches reported thus far sacrifice spoken content for anonymisation performance. We report what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to actively preserve spoken content in voice anonymisation. We show how the output of an auxiliary automatic speech recognition model can be used to condition the vocoder module of an anonymisation system using a set of learnable embedding dictionaries in order to preserve spoken content. Relative to a baseline approach, and for only a modest cost in anonymisation performance, the technique is successful in decreasing the word error rate computed from anonymised utterances by almost 60%.</description>

      <title>HydraFormer: One Encoder For All Subsampling Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In automatic speech recognition, subsampling is essential for tackling diverse scenarios. However, the inadequacy of a single subsampling rate to address various real-world situations often necessitates training and deploying multiple models, consequently increasing associated costs. To address this issue, we propose HydraFormer, comprising HydraSub, a Conformer-based encoder, and a BiTransformer-based decoder. HydraSub encompasses multiple branches, each representing a distinct subsampling rate, allowing for the flexible selection of any branch during inference based on the specific use case. HydraFormer can efficiently manage different subsampling rates, significantly reducing training and deployment expenses. Experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech datasets reveal that HydraFormer effectively adapts to various subsampling rates and languages while maintaining high recognition performance. Additionally, HydraFormer showcases exceptional stability, sustaining consistent performance under various initialization conditions, and exhibits robust transferability by learning from pretrained single subsampling rate automatic speech recognition models\footnote{Model code and scripts: https://github.com/HydraFormer/hydraformer}.</description>

      <title>Simulating Articulatory Trajectories with Phonological Feature Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a first step towards a complete computational model of speech learning involving perception-production loops, we investigate the forward mapping between pseudo-motor commands and articulatory trajectories. Two phonological feature sets, based respectively on generative and articulatory phonology, are used to encode a phonetic target sequence. Different interpolation techniques are compared to generate smooth trajectories in these feature spaces, with a potential optimisation of the target value and timing to capture co-articulation effects. We report the Pearson correlation between a linear projection of the generated trajectories and articulatory data derived from a multi-speaker dataset of electromagnetic articulography (EMA) recordings. A correlation of 0.67 is obtained with an extended feature set based on generative phonology and a linear interpolation technique. We discuss the implications of our results for our understanding of the dynamics of biological motion.</description>

      <title>Articulatory Configurations across Genders and Periods in French Radio and TV archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies changes in articulatory configurations across genders and periods using an inversion from acoustic to articulatory parameters. From a diachronic corpus based on French media archives spanning 60 years from 1955 to 2015, automatic transcription and forced alignment allowed extracting the central frame of each vowel. More than one million frames were obtained from over a thousand speakers across gender and age categories. Their formants were used from these vocalic frames to fit the parameters of Maeda's articulatory model. Evaluations of the quality of these processes are provided. We focus here on two parameters of Maeda's model linked to total vocal tract length: the relative position of the larynx (higher for females) and the lips protrusion (more protruded for males). Implications for voice quality across genders are discussed. The effect across periods seems gender independent; thus, the assertion that females lowered their pitch with time is not supported.</description>

      <title>Speaker Adaptation for Quantised End-to-End ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end models have shown superior performance for automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, such models are often very large in size and thus challenging to deploy on resource-constrained edge devices. While quantisation can reduce model sizes, it can lead to increased word error rates (WERs). Although improved quantisation methods were proposed to address the issue of performance degradation, the fact that quantised models deployed on edge devices often target only on a small group of users is under-explored. To this end, we propose personalisation for quantised models (P4Q), a novel strategy that uses speaker adaptation (SA) to improve quantised end-to-end ASR models by fitting them to the characteristics of the target speakers. In this paper, we study the P4Q strategy based on Whisper and Conformer attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) end-to-end ASR models, which leverages a 4-bit block-wise NormalFloat4 (NF4) approach for quantisation and the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approach for SA. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech and the TED-LIUM 3 corpora show that, with a 7-time reduction in model size and 1% extra speaker-specific parameters, 15.1% and 23.3% relative WER reductions were achieved on quantised Whisper and Conformer AED models respectively, comparing to the full precision models.</description>

      <title>wav2graph: A Framework for Supervised Learning Knowledge Graph from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) and search engines by providing structured, interconnected data that improves reasoning and context-awareness. However, KGs only focus on text data, thereby neglecting other modalities such as speech. In this work, we introduce wav2graph, the first framework for supervised learning knowledge graph from speech data. Our pipeline are straightforward: (1) constructing a KG based on transcribed spoken utterances and a named entity database, (2) converting KG into embedding vectors, and (3) training graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification and link prediction tasks. Through extensive experiments conducted in inductive and transductive learning contexts using state-of-the-art GNN models, we provide baseline results and error analysis for node classification and link prediction tasks on human transcripts and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, including evaluations using both encoder-based and decoder-based node embeddings, as well as monolingual and multilingual acoustic pre-trained models. All related code, data, and models are published online.</description>

      <title>Distil-DCCRN: A Small-footprint DCCRN Leveraging Feature-based Knowledge Distillation in Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deep complex convolution recurrent network (DCCRN) achieves excellent speech enhancement performance by utilizing the audio spectrum's complex features. However, it has a large number of model parameters. We propose a smaller model, Distil-DCCRN, which has only 30% of the parameters compared to the DCCRN. To ensure that the performance of Distil-DCCRN matches that of the DCCRN, we employ the knowledge distillation (KD) method to use a larger teacher model to help train a smaller student model. We design a knowledge distillation (KD) method, integrating attention transfer and Kullback-Leibler divergence (AT-KL) to train the student model Distil-DCCRN. Additionally, we use a model with better performance and a more complicated structure, Uformer, as the teacher model. Unlike previous KD approaches that mainly focus on model outputs, our method also leverages the intermediate features from the models' middle layers, facilitating rich knowledge transfer across different structured models despite variations in layer configurations and discrepancies in the channel and time dimensions of intermediate features. Employing our AT-KL approach, Distil-DCCRN outperforms DCCRN as well as several other competitive models in both PESQ and SI-SNR metrics on the DNS test set and achieves comparable results to DCCRN in DNSMOS.</description>

      <title>TheGlueNote: Learned Representations for Robust and Flexible Note Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Note alignment refers to the task of matching individual notes of two versions of the same symbolically encoded piece. Methods addressing this task commonly rely on sequence alignment algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models or Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) applied directly to note or onset sequences. While successful in many cases, such methods struggle with large mismatches between the versions. In this work, we learn note-wise representations from data augmented with various complex mismatch cases, e.g. repeats, skips, block insertions, and long trills. At the heart of our approach lies a transformer encoder network - TheGlueNote - which predicts pairwise note similarities for two 512 note subsequences. We postprocess the predicted similarities using flavors of weightedDTW and pitch-separated onsetDTW to retrieve note matches for two sequences of arbitrary length. Our approach performs on par with the state of the art in terms of note alignment accuracy, is considerably more robust to version mismatches, and works directly on any pair of MIDI files.</description>

      <title>NeuralMultiling: A Novel Neural Architecture Search for Smartphone based Multilingual Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual speaker verification introduces the challenge of verifying a speaker in multiple languages. Existing systems were built using i-vector/x-vector approaches along with Bi-LSTMs, which were trained to discriminate speakers, irrespective of the language. Instead of exploring the design space manually, we propose a neural architecture search for multilingual speaker verification suitable for mobile devices, called \textbf{NeuralMultiling}. First, our algorithm searches for an optimal operational combination of neural cells with different architectures for normal cells and reduction cells and then derives a CNN model by stacking neural cells. Using the derived architecture, we performed two different studies:1) language agnostic condition and 2) interoperability between languages and devices on the publicly available Multilingual Audio-Visual Smartphone (MAVS) dataset. The experimental results suggest that the derived architecture significantly outperforms the existing Autospeech method by a 5-6\% reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) with fewer model parameters.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Binaural Signal Matching with Arbitrary Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binaural reproduction is rapidly becoming a topic of great interest in the research community, especially with the surge of new and popular devices, such as virtual reality headsets, smart glasses, and head-tracked headphones. In order to immerse the listener in a virtual or remote environment with such devices, it is essential to generate realistic and accurate binaural signals. This is challenging, especially since the microphone arrays mounted on these devices are typically composed of an arbitrarily-arranged small number of microphones, which impedes the use of standard audio formats like Ambisonics, and provides limited spatial resolution. The binaural signal matching (BSM) method was developed recently to overcome these challenges. While it produced binaural signals with low error using relatively simple arrays, its performance degraded significantly when head rotation was introduced. This paper aims to develop the BSM method further and overcome its limitations. For this purpose, the method is first analyzed in detail, and a design framework that guarantees accurate binaural reproduction for relatively complex acoustic environments is presented. Next, it is shown that the BSM accuracy may significantly degrade at high frequencies, and thus, a perceptually motivated extension to the method is proposed, based on a magnitude least-squares (MagLS) formulation. These insights and developments are then analyzed with the help of an extensive simulation study of a simple six-microphone semi-circular array. It is further shown that the BSM-MagLS method can be very useful in compensating for head rotations with this array. Finally, a listening experiment is conducted with a four-microphone array on a pair of glasses in a reverberant speech environment and including head rotations, where it is shown that BSM-MagLS can indeed produce binaural signals with a high perceived quality.</description>

      <title>U2++ MoE: Scaling 4.7x parameters with minimal impact on RTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale has opened new frontiers in natural language processing, but at a high cost. In response, by learning to only activate a subset of parameters in training and inference, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have been proposed as an energy efficient path to even larger and more capable language models and this shift towards a new generation of foundation models is gaining momentum, particularly within the field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Recent works that incorporating MoE into ASR models have complex designs such as routing frames via supplementary embedding network, improving multilingual ability for the experts, and utilizing dedicated auxiliary losses for either expert load balancing or specific language handling. We found that delicate designs are not necessary, while an embarrassingly simple substitution of MoE layers for all Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers is competent for the ASR task. To be more specific, we benchmark our proposed model on a large scale inner-source dataset (160k hours), the results show that we can scale our baseline Conformer (Dense-225M) to its MoE counterparts (MoE-1B) and achieve Dense-1B level Word Error Rate (WER) while maintaining a Dense-225M level Real Time Factor (RTF). Furthermore, by applying Unified 2-pass framework with bidirectional attention decoders (U2++), we achieve the streaming and non-streaming decoding modes in a single MoE based model, which we call U2++ MoE. We hope that our study can facilitate the research on scaling speech foundation models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.</description>

      <title>STONE: Self-supervised Tonality Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks can estimate the key of a musical piece, their supervision incurs a massive annotation effort. Against this shortcoming, we present STONE, the first self-supervised tonality estimator. The architecture behind STONE, named ChromaNet, is a convnet with octave equivalence which outputs a key signature profile (KSP) of 12 structured logits. First, we train ChromaNet to regress artificial pitch transpositions between any two unlabeled musical excerpts from the same audio track, as measured as cross-power spectral density (CPSD) within the circle of fifths (CoF). We observe that this self-supervised pretext task leads KSP to correlate with tonal key signature. Based on this observation, we extend STONE to output a structured KSP of 24 logits, and introduce supervision so as to disambiguate major versus minor keys sharing the same key signature. Applying different amounts of supervision yields semi-supervised and fully supervised tonality estimators: i.e., Semi-TONEs and Sup-TONEs. We evaluate these estimators on FMAK, a new dataset of 5489 real-world musical recordings with expert annotation of 24 major and minor keys. We find that Semi-TONE matches the classification accuracy of Sup-TONE with reduced supervision and outperforms it with equal supervision.</description>
