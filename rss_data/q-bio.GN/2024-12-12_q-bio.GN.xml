      <title>A robust, scalable K-statistic for quantifying immune cell clustering in spatial proteomics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial summary statistics based on point process theory are widely used to quantify the spatial organization of cell populations in single-cell spatial proteomics data. Among these, Ripley's $K$ is a popular metric for assessing whether cells are spatially clustered or are randomly dispersed. However, the key assumption of spatial homogeneity is frequently violated in spatial proteomics data, leading to overestimates of cell clustering and colocalization. To address this, we propose a novel $K$-based method, termed \textit{KAMP} (\textbf{K} adjustment by \textbf{A}nalytical \textbf{M}oments of the \textbf{P}ermutation distribution), for quantifying the spatial organization of cells in spatial proteomics samples. \textit{KAMP} leverages background cells in each sample along with a new closed-form representation of the first and second moments of the permutation distribution of Ripley's $K$ to estimate an empirical null model. Our method is robust to inhomogeneity, computationally efficient even in large datasets, and provides approximate $p$-values for testing spatial clustering and colocalization. Methodological developments are motivated by a spatial proteomics study of 103 women with ovarian cancer, where our analysis using \textit{KAMP} shows a positive association between immune cell clustering and overall patient survival. Notably, we also find evidence that using $K$ without correcting for sample inhomogeneity may bias hazard ratio estimates in downstream analyses. \textit{KAMP} completes this analysis in just 5 minutes, compared to 538 minutes for the only competing method that adequately addresses inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>LA4SR: illuminating the dark proteome with generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI language models (LMs) show promise for biological sequence analysis. We re-engineered open-source LMs (GPT-2, BLOOM, DistilRoBERTa, ELECTRA, and Mamba, ranging from 70M to 12B parameters) for microbial sequence classification. The models achieved F1 scores up to 95 and operated 16,580x faster and at 2.9x the recall of BLASTP. They effectively classified the algal dark proteome - uncharacterized proteins comprising about 65% of total proteins - validated on new data including a new, complete Hi-C/Pacbio Chlamydomonas genome. Larger (&gt;1B) LA4SR models reached high accuracy (F1 &gt; 86) when trained on less than 2% of available data, rapidly achieving strong generalization capacity. High accuracy was achieved when training data had intact or scrambled terminal information, demonstrating robust generalization to incomplete sequences. Finally, we provide custom AI explainability software tools for attributing amino acid patterns to AI generative processes and interpret their outputs in evolutionary and biophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Active learning for efficient discovery of optimal gene combinations in the combinatorial perturbation space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of novel combinatorial CRISPR screening technologies enables the identification of synergistic gene combinations on a large scale. This is crucial for developing novel and effective combination therapies, but the combinatorial space makes exhaustive experimentation infeasible. We introduce NAIAD, an active learning framework that efficiently discovers optimal gene pairs capable of driving cells toward desired cellular phenotypes. NAIAD leverages single-gene perturbation effects and adaptive gene embeddings that scale with the training data size, mitigating overfitting in small-sample learning while capturing complex gene interactions as more data is collected. Evaluated on four CRISPR combinatorial perturbation datasets totaling over 350,000 genetic interactions, NAIAD, trained on small datasets, outperforms existing models by up to 40\% relative to the second-best. NAIAD's recommendation system prioritizes gene pairs with the maximum predicted effects, resulting in the highest marginal gain in each AI-experiment round and accelerating discovery with fewer CRISPR experimental iterations. Our NAIAD framework (https://github.com/NeptuneBio/NAIAD) improves the identification of novel, effective gene combinations, enabling more efficient CRISPR library design and offering promising applications in genomics research and therapeutic development.</description>
