      <title>SU(2) gauge theory with one and two adjoint fermions towards the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an extended lattice study of the SU(2) gauge theory coupled to one Dirac fermion flavour ($N_{\mathrm{f}} =1$) transforming in the adjoint representation as the continuum limit is approached. This investigation is supplemented by numerical results obtained for the SU(2) gauge theory with two Dirac fermion flavours ($N_{\mathrm{f}} =2$) transforming in the adjoint representation, for which we perform numerical investigations at a single lattice spacing value, which is analysed together with earlier calculations. The purpose of our study is to advance the characterisation of the infrared properties of both theories, which previous investigations have concluded to be in the conformal window. For both, we determine the mass spectrum and the anomalous dimension of the fermion condensate using finite-size hyperscaling of the spectrum, mode number analysis of the Dirac operator (for which we improve on our previous proposal) and the ratio of masses of the lightest spin-2 particle over the lightest scalar. All methods provide a consistent picture, with the anomalous dimension of the condensate $\gamma_*$ decreasing significantly as one approaches the continuum limit for the $N_{\mathrm{f}} = 1$ theory towards a value consistent with $\gamma_* = 0.174(6)$, while for $N_{\mathrm{f}} = 2$ the anomalous dimension decreases more slowly with $\beta$. A chiral perturbation theory analysis show that the infrared behaviour of both theories is incompatible with the breaking of chiral symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Universal Thermalization Dynamics in a (2+1)D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems, including thermalization, is a promising application of near-term and future quantum computation. By performing experiments on a digital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled trapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics of a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using randomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical approximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution and the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables exhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for thermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust tools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body systems, including in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Highly-efficient quantum Fourier transformations for some nonabelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Fourier transformations are an essential component of many quantum algorithms, from prime factoring to quantum simulation. While the standard abelian QFT is well-studied, important variants corresponding to \emph{nonabelian} groups of interest have seen less development. In particular, fast nonabelian Fourier transformations are important components for both quantum simulations of field theories as well as approaches to the nonabelian hidden subgroup problem. In this work, we present fast quantum Fourier transformations for a number of nonabelian groups of interest for high energy physics, $\mathbb{BT}$, $\mathbb{BO}$, $\Delta(27)$, $\Delta(54)$, and $\Sigma(36\times3)$. For each group, we derive explicit quantum circuits and estimate resource scaling for fault-tolerant implementations. Our work shows that the development of a fast Fourier transformation can substantively reduce simulation costs by up to three orders of magnitude for the finite groups that we have investigated.</description>

      <title>Fully strange tetraquark resonant states as the cousins of $X(6900)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct systematic calculations of the S-wave fully strange systems with ``normal" $\left(J^{P C}=0^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++}\right)$ and ``exotic" $\left(J^{P C}=0^{+-}, 1^{++}, 2^{+-}\right)$ C-parities, which are the strange analogue of the fully charmed tetraquark state $X(6900)$. Within a constituent quark potential model, we employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation and the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. We obtain a series of resonant states and zero-width states in the mass range of 2.7 to 3.3 GeV, with their widths ranging from less than 1 MeV to about 50 MeV. Their rms radii strongly indicate that they are compact tetraquark states. Among these states, the $T_{4s,2^{++}}(2714)$ may be the most likely one to be observed experimentally. We urge the experimental exploration of the $2^{++}$ $s s \bar{s} \bar{s}$ state around 2.7 GeV in the $\phi\phi$ channel. Since the lowest S-wave $s s \bar{s} \bar{s}$ state is around 2.7 GeV, the compact P-wave $s s \bar{s} \bar{s}$ states are expected to be heavier. Hence, $\phi(2170)$ and $X(2370)$ are unlikely to be compact tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting, we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. We report here that our results are in good agreement with very recent data from BESIII, within the uncertainty limits of our model. We also make new predictions which may be tested in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>
