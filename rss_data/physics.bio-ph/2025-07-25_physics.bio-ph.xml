      <title>Lambert W-kink Solitons Arising from Higher-Order Nonlinearities of Lipid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of nerve impulse propagation requires accounting for strong higher-order nonlinearities in membrane dynamics, as incorporated in the extended Heimburg-Jackson model. By introducing third- and fourth-order polynomial terms into the membrane density equation, we derive a generalized Duffing-type equation that better captures the complex biophysical states involved in signal transmission. Applying the factorization method, we construct exact travelling wave solutions, including a novel class of Lambert W-Kink-type solitons. These findings provide new analytical insight into the nonlinear electromechanical behaviour of nerve membranes and contribute to the theoretical foundation for understanding pulse propagation in biomembranes.</description>

      <title>Differential Crosslinking and Contractile Motors Drive Nuclear Chromatin Compaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During interphase, a typical cell nucleus features spatial compartmentalization of transcriptionally active euchromatin and repressed heterochromatin domains. In conventional nuclear organization, euchromatin predominantly occupies the nuclear interior, while heterochromatin, which is approximately 50% more dense than euchromatin, is positioned near the nuclear periphery. Peripheral chromatin organization can be further modulated by the nuclear lamina, which is itself a deformable structure. While a number of biophysical mechanisms for compartmentalization within rigid nuclei have been explored, we study a chromatin model consisting of an active, crosslinked polymer tethered to a deformable, polymeric lamina shell. Contractile motors, the deformability of the shell, and the spatial distribution of crosslinks all play pivotal roles in this compartmentalization. We find that a radial crosslink density distribution, even with a small linear differential of higher crosslinking density at the edge of the nucleus, combined with contractile motor activity, drives genomic segregation, in agreement with experimental observations. This arises from contractile motors preferentially drawing crosslinks into their vicinity at the nuclear periphery, forming high-density domains that promote heterochromatin formation. We also find an increased stiffness of nuclear wrinkles given the preferential heterochromatin compaction below the lamina shell, which is consistent with instantaneous nuclear stiffening under applied nanoindentation. We conclude with the potential for experimental validation of our model predictions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing SPION Labeling for Single-Cell Magnetic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the correlation between iron mass on cell surfaces and the resultant magnetic field. Human colorectal cancer cells (HT29 line) were labeled with varying concentrations of SPIONs and imaged via a NV center widefield magnetic microscope. To assess the labeling efficacy, a convolutional neural network trained on simulated magnetic dipole data was utilized to reconstruct key labeling parameters on a cell-by-cell basis, including cell diameter, sensor proximity, and the iron mass associated with surface-bound SPIONs. Our analysis provided quantitative metrics for these parameters across a range of labeling concentrations. The findings indicated that increasing SPION concentration enhances both the cell-surface iron mass and magnetic field strength, demonstrating a saturation effect. This methodology offers a coherent framework for the quantitative, high-throughput characterization of magnetically labeled cells, presenting significant implications for the fields of cell biology and magnetic sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Aubry-Andr\'e Localization Transition for an Active Undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of deformable self-propelling objects like bacteria, worms, snakes, and robots through heterogeneous environments is poorly understood. In this paper, we use experiment, simulation, and theory to study a snake-like robot as it undulates without sensory feedback through a narrow channel containing a linear array of boulder-like hemispherical obstacles. The profile of the boulder landscape approximates a one-dimensional potential introduced by Aubry and Andr\'e (AA) to study wave function localization in aperiodic lattices. The AA model provides a deterministically disordered alternative to the better-known phenomenon of Anderson localization, which occurs in truly random disordered lattices. When the boulder landscape is strictly periodic, the robot can pass completely through the channel. But if the landscape is sufficiently aperiodic, the robot becomes trapped and fails to exit the channel. The metrics we use to quantify this transition -- including exponential distributions of robot position when localized -- agree well with earlier experimental and theoretical work on a localization transition that occurs when quantum waves interact with the AA potential. A theoretical treatment of the robot's motion using resistive force theory modified to include spatially varying drag forces reproduces the behavior we observe. Further, our results indicate that the transition is generated by large fluctuations in the driving torques required for self-propulsion. These results point to a potentially fundamental connection between classical and quantum wave mechanics and the locomotion of undulators. Our study illustrates how analogies with models from condensed matter physics and wave optics can lead to the discovery of principles of self-propulsion in non-periodic landscapes.</description>

      <title>Optimal chirality enhances long-range fluctuation-induced interactions in active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding interactions between chiral active particles -- self-propelling and self-rotating entities -- is crucial for uncovering how chiral active matter self-organizes into dynamic structures. Although fluctuation-induced forces in nonequilibrium active systems can drive structure formation, the role of chirality remains largely unexplored. We investigate effective fluctuation-induced forces between intruders immersed in chiral active fluids and reveal that the impact of chirality depends sensitively on particle shape. For circular particles, increasing the self-rotation to self-propulsion ratio suppresses the interaction, reflecting a transition from rotating flocks to localized spinners. Contrarily, a striking collective behavior emerges for rodlike particles: vortices spontaneously form around the intruders, most pronounced at an optimal chiral angle where the mean curvature of particle trajectories matches the intruder boundary curvature, maximizing the effective force. We map the attractive and repulsive force regimes across chirality, propulsion, and intruder separation, offering new insights and principles for designing and controlling self-assembled active systems.</description>

      <title>Form and function in biological filaments: A physicist's review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nature uses elongated shapes and filaments to build stable structures, generate motion, and allow complex geometric interactions. In this Review, we examine the role of biological filaments across different length scales. From the molecular scale, where cytoskeletal filaments provides a robust but dynamic cellular scaffolding, over the scale of cellular appendages like cilia and flagella, to the scale of filamentous microorganisms like cyanobacteria, among the most successful genera on Earth, and even to the scale of elongated animals like worms and snakes, whose motility modes inspire robotic analogues. We highlight the general mechanisms that couple form and function. We discuss physical principles and models, such as classical elasticity and the non-reciprocity of active matter, that can be used to trace unifying themes linking these systems across about nine orders of magnitude in length.</description>
