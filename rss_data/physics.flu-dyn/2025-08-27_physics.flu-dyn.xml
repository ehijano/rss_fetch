      <title>An Experimental Framework to Study Turbulence Induced Particle Mobilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental framework was developed to study the initiation of particle mobilization in a laboratory setting. Large and heavy particles mobilized by a turbulent, gaseous carrier-phase were considered. An airfoil oscillated in the free-stream, generating a tonal free-stream disturbance that perturbed a turbulent boundary layer. The flow developing behind this forced flow was characterized using hot-wire anemometry and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Downstream of the oscillating airfoil mechanism, the turbulent boundary layer responded to the forcing in the form of excess energy at the forcing scale. The signature of this forcing scale was observed to span the entire wall-normal extent of the flow, extending all the way down to the wall. The size of this flow scale was shown to be controlled by changing the frequency of oscillation, while the energy in this flow scale was controlled via the amplitude of oscillation. Demonstrative measurements are presented in which this forced carrier-phase flow mobilized a particle-phase on a particle bed. A PIV-based approach was used to measure the initiation of particle motion as well as the incoming carrier-phase velocity field. The particles on the bed were mobilized ``on-demand'' by the deflection of the airfoil. Consistent with prior work, it was observed that particle mobilization was correlated with the large-scale flow structures of the carrier-phase.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery and Formulation Refines the Quasi-Steady Model of Flapping-Wing Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology, physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs: high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models, we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000 candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying robots.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of turbulence and turbulent thermal diffusion in strongly inhomogeneous and anisotropic forced convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate properties of turbulence and turbulent transport of non-inertial particles described in terms of turbulent thermal diffusion in strongly inhomogeneous and anisotropic convection forced by two turbulence generators with oscillating membrane and a steady grid in the air flow (with the Rayleigh number about $10^8$). Velocity field and spatial distribution of particles are measured using Particle Image Velocimetry system. The temperature distribution is measured in many locations using a temperature probe equipped with 12 E - thermocouples. In the forced convection, inhomogeneities of the mean temperature field and the particle number density in the horizontal direction in the core flow is much stronger than in the vertical direction. The mean fluid velocity structure show transition between a single-roll pattern for isothermal turbulence to double-roll patterns with increase of the temperature difference between the bottom and upper walls of the chamber. For larger temperature differences, the mean fluid velocity structure returns to a single-roll pattern. The maximum of the mean particle number density is located in the regions with minimum of the mean temperature and vise versa in agreement with the predictions based on the phenomenon of turbulent thermal diffusion.</description>

      <title>Wake dynamics of finite-aspect-ratio rotating circular cylinders at low Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulations of flows over finite-aspect-ratio rotating circular cylinders at a Reynolds number of 150 over a range of aspect ratios ($AR=2-12$) and rotation rates ($\alpha=0-5$), aiming at revealing the free-end effects on the wake dynamics and aerodynamic performance. As a direct consequence of lift generation, a pair of counter-rotating tip vortices is formed at the free ends. At low rotation rates, the finite rotating cylinder behaves like a typical bluff body that generates unsteady vortex shedding with three-dimensional modal structures. Such unsteady flows can be stabilized not only by increasing rotation rate that weakens the free shear layer, but also by decreasing aspect ratio which enhances the tip-vortex-induced downwash. A further increase of $\alpha$ triggers the onset of unsteadiness in the tip vortices. At still higher rotation rates, the C-shaped Taylor-like vortices bounded on the cylinder surface emerge from the free ends and propel towards the midspan due to the self-induced velocity by vortex-wall interaction. With increasing $\alpha$, the free-end effects penetrate to the inboard span, leading to reduced lift and elevated drag compared to the two-dimensional flows. The three-dimensional end effects can be effectively suppressed by the addition of end plates, which position the tip vortices away from the cylinder, thereby significantly improving the aerodynamic performance. This study reveals the mechanisms for the formation of three-dimensional wakes under the influence of the free ends of finite rotating cylinders. The insights obtained here can serve as a stepping stone for understanding the complex high-$Re$ flows that are more relevant to industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A microfluidic band-pass filter for flexible fiber separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.</description>

      <title>Resonant Interactions of Poincare Waves in the Shallow Water Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper develops a weakly nonlinear theory of Poincare waves. The nondegeneracy of the Poincare wave dispersion law leads to the presence of resonant interactions in perturbation theory. A study of the dispersion relation of Poincare waves showed that three-wave interactions are absent in the quadratic nonlinear approximation. In this paper, a linear equation of the envelope is derived. A qualitative study of the dispersion law showed the existence of four-wave interactions of Poincare waves. Equations of nonlinear interactions of four waves for the amplitudes of Poincare waves are derived. The Manley-Rowe equations are obtained, which determine the distribution of energy and its transfer between interacting waves. The nonlinear dynamics of interacting waves is investigated. The saturation effect of Poincare waves, which is important for geophysical hydrodynamics, has been predicted. An analytical solution is obtained that describes the saturation effect of Poincare waves in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a quantitative assessment of different strategies to compute the contribution due to surface tension in incompressible two-phase flows using a conservative level set (CLS) method. More specifically, we compare classical approaches, such as the direct computation of the curvature from the level set or the Laplace-Beltrami operator, with an evolution equation for the mean curvature recently proposed in literature. We consider the test case of a static bubble, for which an exact solution for the pressure jump across the interface is available, and the test case of an oscillating bubble, showing pros and cons of the different approaches.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of contaminant flow through porous media containing random adsorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many porous media are mixtures of inert and reactive materials, manifesting spatio-chemical heterogeneity. We study the evolution of scalar transport in a chemically heterogeneous material that mimics a green roof soil substrate, fractionally composed of inert and reactive adsorbing particles. These adsorbing particles are equivalent to biochar within a real soil substrate. The scalar transport evolution is determined using experiments and simulations calibrated from experimental data. Experiment 1 is used to determine the equilibrium capacity and adsorption rate of two biochar types when immersed in a methylene blue solution. Breakthrough curves of a packed bed of glass beads with randomly interspersed biochar are determined in experiment 2. Simulations are then run to investigate the solute transport and adsorption dynamics at the pore-scale. An analytical model is proposed to capture the behavior of the biochar adsorption capacity and the simulation results are compared with experiment 2. A pore-scale analysis showed that uniformly sized beds are superior in contaminant breakthrough reduction, which is related to the adsorptive surface area and the rate at which adsorption capacity is reached. Cases using the adsorption capacity model display a tight distribution of particle surface concentration at later simulation times, indicating maximum possible adsorption. The beds with dissimilar particle sizes create more channeling effects which reduce adsorptive particle efficiency and consequently higher breakthrough concentration profiles. Comparison between experiments and simulations show good agreement. Improved biochar performance can be achieved by maintaining particle size uniformity alongside high adsorption capacity and adsorption rates appropriate to the rainfall intensity.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in stratified rotating topographic wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence generation mechanisms in stratified, rotating flows past three-dimensional (3D) topography remain underexplored, particularly in submesoscale (SMS) regimes critical to geophysical applications. Using turbulence-resolving large-eddy simulations, we systematically dissect the interplay of stratification and rotation in governing the dynamics of wake turbulence. Our parametric study reveals that turbulent dissipation in the near wake is dominated by two distinct instabilities: (1) vertical shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), amplified by oblique dislocation of K\'arm\'an vortices under strong stratification, and (2) centrifugal/inertial instability (CI), which peaks at intermediate rotation rates (Rossby number order unity, SMS regime) and relatively weaker stratification. Notably, strong rotation dampens vertical shear and weakens KHI-driven turbulence, while strong stratification imposes smaller vertical length scales that restrict CI-driven turbulence. By quantifying dissipation across a broad parameter space of stratification and rotation, predictive relationships between the environmental parameters and instability dominance is established. These findings highlight the regime dependence of instability mechanisms and may inform targeted observational campaigns and numerical models of oceanic and atmospheric wakes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a numerical method for simulation of wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering function in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure numerical scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Comprehensive numerical simulations, along with systematic comparisons against other numerical approaches, are conducted for both turbulent and laminar flows in unbounded and wall-bounded domains, considering two- and three-dimensional cases. These results collectively demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Reduced Subgrid Scale Terms in Three-Dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large eddy simulation (LES) has become a central technique for simulating turbulent flows in engineering and applied sciences, offering a compromise between accuracy and computational cost by resolving large scale motions and modeling the effects of smaller, unresolved scales through a subgrid scale (SGS) model. The fidelity and robustness of LES depends critically on the SGS model, particularly in coarse simulations where much of the turbulence spectrum remains unresolved.
  In this work, we extend the tau-orthogonal (TO) method, a data-driven SGS modeling framework, to three-dimensional turbulent flows. The method reformulates the high-dimensional SGS closure problem as a low-dimensional prediction task focused on scale-aware quantities of interest (QoIs). We extend the model to incorporate QoI-state dependence and temporal correlations by combining regularized least-squares regression with a multivariate Gaussian residual model. This yields a simple yet effective stochastic time-series prediction model (the LRS model), with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters than typical deep learning approaches which try to directly learn the high-dimensional SGS closure.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TO LRS model in three-dimensional forced isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flow. The model achieves accurate long-term QoI distributions, robust performance across hyperparameter settings, and good reproduction of key flow features such as kinetic energy spectra and coherent structures, despite being trained solely on QoI trajectories. Comparisons against classical SGS models, including Smagorinsky and WALE formulations, highlight the TO LRS model's balance of accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Solute dispersion in axially strained tube flows: Large-time asymptotics and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Gaussian profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion of a passive scalar in an axially strained flow in a slender tube is studied, with particular focus on large-time asymptotics following the approach of~\cite{rajamanickam2020dispersion}. For times exceeding the cross-sectional diffusion timescale, the scalar field forms an axial (Ornstein--Uhlenbeck) Gaussian profile whose variance increases exponentially with the local axial strain, which itself varies with radial location, while radial diffusion only slowly modulates the overall amplitude. In other words, the scalar is dominated by strong axial stretching, completely overwhelming radial diffusion. In striking contrast to classical Taylor dispersion, where radial diffusion rapidly homogenizes the profile and axial convection appears only as a small correction, here axial stretching governs the dominant dynamics, producing a fundamentally different transport mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04580v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an implicit Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization for incompressible two-phase flows using an artificial compressibility formulation. The conservative level set (CLS) method is employed in combination with a reinitialization procedure to capture the moving interface. A projection method based on the L-stable TR-BDF2 method is adopted for the time discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations and of the level set method. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is employed to enhance the resolution in correspondence of the interface between the two fluids. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown in a number of classical benchmarks. A specific analysis on the influence of different choices of the mixture viscosity is also carried out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of perturbations in a compressible one-dimensional inviscid gas with an ambient state consisting of constant pressure and periodically-varying density. We show through asymptotic analysis that long-wavelength perturbations approximately obey a system of dispersive nonlinear wave equations. Computational experiments demonstrate that solutions of the 1D Euler equations agree well with this dispersive model, with solutions consisting mainly of solitary waves. Shock formation seems to be avoided for moderate-amplitude initial data, while shock formation occurs for larger initial data. We investigate the threshold for transition between these behaviors, validating a previously-proposed criterion based on further computational experiments. These results support the existence of large-time non-breaking solutions to the 1D compressible Euler equations, as hypothesized in previous works.</description>
