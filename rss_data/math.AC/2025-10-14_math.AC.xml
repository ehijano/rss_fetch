      <title>On 2-absorbing submodules and their Amalgamations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be commutative rings with $1\neq 0,\;M$ and $N$ be unitary $R_1-$module and $R_2-$module, respectively. $f:R_1\rightarrow R_2$ be a ring homomorphism and $\varphi: M\rightarrow N$ be an $R-$module homomorphism. This article studied $2-$absorbing submodule that is a generalization of the concept of prime submodule. Firstly, some characterizations of $2-$absorbing submodule are presented. Then, we examine the notion of $2-$absorbing submodule in amalgamation module $M \bowtie^{\varphi} JN$. We detected when $F\bowtie^\varphi JN$ is a $2-$absorbing submodule of $M \bowtie^{\varphi} JN$ by using the isomorphism $\frac{M \bowtie^{\varphi} JN}{F \bowtie^{\varphi} JN} \cong \frac{M}{F}$ and the homomorphism $p_{\gamma}: M \bowtie^{\varphi} JN \rightarrow \varphi(M)+JN$, where $J$ be an ideal of $R_2$ and $F$ be a submodule of $M.$</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner bases and the second generalized Hamming weight of a linear code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that for binary codes one can use Gr\"obner bases to obtain a subset of codewords of minimal support that can be used to determine the second generalized Hamming weight of the code. In this paper we establish conditions on a nonbinary code under which the same property holds. We also construct a family of codes over any nonbinary finite field where the property does not hold. Furthermore, we prove that whenever the subset obtained via Gr\"obner basis suffices to determine the second generalized Hamming weight, this invariant can also be recovered from the degrees of the syzygies of a minimal free resolution.</description>

      <title>The Graded Betti Numbers of the Skeletons of Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class $C$ of squarefree monomial ideals $I$ in a polynomial ring $R=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ over a filed $K$ where $\dim R/I$ equals the maximum degree of the minimal generators of $I$ minus one. We show that the Stanley-Reisner ideal of any $i$-skeleton of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ in the class $C$ for $-1\le i&lt;\dim\Delta$. Then, we introduce the notion of a degree resolution and prove that every ideal in the class $C$ possesses this property. Finally, we provides a formula to compute the graded Betti numbers of the $i$-skeletons of a simplicial complex in terms of the graded Betti numbers of the original complex. Conversely, we also present a way to express the graded Betti numbers of the original complex in terms of the graded Betti numbers of one of its skeletons.</description>

      <title>Uniformly-S-pseudo-projective modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of uniformly-S-pseudo-projective (u-S-pseudo-projective) modules as a generalization of u-S-projective modules. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. An R-module P is said to be u-S-pseudo-projective if for any submodule K of P, there is s\in S such that for any u-S-epimorphism f:P\to \frac{P}{K}, sf can be lifted to an endomorphism g:P\to P. Some properties of this notion are obtained. For example, we prove that an R-module M is u-S-quasi-projective if and only if M\oplus M is u-S-pseudo-projective. A new characterization of u-S-semisimple rings is given in terms of this notion.</description>

      <title>From points to complexes: a concept of unexpectedness for simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018, Cook, Harbourne, Migliore and Nagel introduced the concept of unexpected hypersurfaces, which connects the study of Lefschetz properties of artinian algebras defined by powers of linear forms, to a family of interpolation problems. In this paper, inspired by the theory of unexpected hypersurfaces, we introduce the concept of unexpected systems of parameters for squarefree monomial ideals. Similarly to the setting of points, we show that the existence of an unexpected system of parameters causes a certain algebra to fail the weak Lefschetz property. We then explore combinatorial interpretations of unexpected systems of parameters, and show that this notion is intrinsically related to the theory of balanced complexes. A consequence of our results is that the theory of Rees algebras turns out to be a powerful tool for studying the existence of systems of parameters satisfying special properties.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner Bases Native to Term-ordered Commutative Algebras, with Application to the Hodge Algebra of Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by better understanding the bideterminant (=product of minors) basis on the polynomial ring in $n \times m$ variables, we develop theory \&amp; algorithms for Gr\"obner bases in not only algebras with straightening law (ASLs or Hodge algebras), but in any commutative algebra over a field that comes equipped with a notion of "monomial" (generalizing the standard monomials of ASLs) and a suitable term order. Rather than treating such an algebra $A$ as a quotient of a polynomial ring and then "lifting" ideals from $A$ to ideals in the polynomial ring, the theory we develop is entirely "native" to $A$ and its given notion of monomial.
  When applied to the case of bideterminants, this enables us to package several standard results on bideterminants in a clean way that enables new results. In particular, once the theory is set up, it lets us give an almost-trivial proof of a universal Gr\"obner basis (in our sense) for the ideal of $t$-minors for any $t$. We note that here it was crucial that theory be native to $A$ and its given monomial structure, as in the standard monomial structure given by bideterminants each $t$-minor is a single variable rather than a sum of $t!$ many terms (in the "ordinary monomial" structure).</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo-Mumford Regularity and Combinatorial Invariants of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes combinatorial bounds on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of edge ideals for trees and their multi-whiskered variants. For a tree \( T \), we give bounds for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of \( I(T) \) in terms of the order, diameter, and number of pendant vertices. Furthermore, we present an upper bound for multi-whiskered trees \( T_{\mathbf{a}} \), demonstrating that the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of \( I(T_{\mathbf{a}}) \) is bounded by the same invariants of the underlying tree \( T \). A principal consequence of this work is the derivation of corresponding inequalities for two key combinatorial invariants of \( T \), namely the induced matching number \( \operatorname{im}(T) \) and the independence number \( \alpha(T) \).</description>

      <title>On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" H$_{\mathrm{match}}$}, relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The Brian\c{c}on-Skoda theorem for pseudo-rational and Du~Bois singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $J = (f_1, \dots, f_n)$ is an $n$-generated ideal in a ring $R$. We prove a general Brian\c{c}on-Skoda-type containment relating the integral closure of powers of $J$ with ordinary powers of $J$. We prove that our result implies the full standard Brian\c{c}on-Skoda containment $\overline{J^{n+k-1}} \subseteq J^k$ for pseudo-rational singularities (for instance regular rings), and even for the weaker condition of birational derived splinters. Our methods also yield the containment $\overline{J^{n+k}} \subseteq J^k$ for Du Bois singularities and even for a characteristic-free generalization.
  We also show that our containment implies other well-known closure-based Brian\c{c}on-Skoda results $\overline{J^{n+k-1}} \subseteq (J^k)^{\cl}$ where, for instance, $\cl$ is tight or plus closure in characteristic $p &gt; 0$, or $\mathrm{ep}$ closure or extension and contraction from $\widehat{R^+}$ in mixed characteristic. Our proof relies on a study of the tensor product of the derived image of the structure sheaf of a partially normalized blowup of $J$ with the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud complex (equivalently the Eagon-Northcott complex) associated to $(f_1,\dots,f_n)^k$.</description>

      <title>Bounded powers of edge ideals: Gorenstein polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I(G) \subset S$ the edge ideal of a finite graph $G$ on $n$ vertices. Given a vector $\mathfrak{c}\in\mathbb{N}^n$ and an integer $q\geq 1$, we denote by $(I(G)^q)_{\mathfrak{c}}$ the ideal of $S$ generated by those monomials belonging to $I(G)^q$ whose exponent vectors are componentwise bounded above by $\mathfrak{c}$. Let $\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I(G))$ denote the largest integer $q$ for which $(I(G)^q)_{\mathfrak{c}}\neq (0)$. Since $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is a polymatroidal ideal, it follows that its minimal set of monomial generators is the set of bases of a discrete polymatroid $\mathcal{D}(G,\mathfrak{c})$. In the present paper, a classification of Gorenstein polytopes of the form ${\rm conv}(\mathcal{D}(G,\mathfrak{c}))$ is studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper classifies the derivations of twisted group algebras in terms of the generators and defining relations of the group. In particular, we generalize some know results over group algebras to the case of twisted group algebras. We will give necessary and sufficient condition for a map defined over the generators to be extended to a derivation over a twisted group ring. We present how this results can be use in case of an abelian group or dihedral group. We also present how this results can be use to compute the first Hochschild cohomology group of twisted group algebras.</description>

      <title>Galois Action and Localization in Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Galois number field $K$, the Galois group $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ acts on the class group $Cl_K$ in a very natural way: $\sigma\cdot[I]=[\sigma(I)]$ for any $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$, $[I]\in Cl_K$. In this paper, we will explore how the unique properties of this group action work together to elucidate the relationship between these two groups. While previous work on this problem has focused on representation theory, we take a direct approach to some classical and new problems. The paper concludes with an exploration of the class groups of localizations of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. These turn out to be powerful tools for understanding $Cl_K$ and overrings of $\mathcal{O}_K$.</description>

      <title>Motivic Homotopy Groups of Spheres and Free Summands of Stably Free Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, we show that the motivic stable homotopy groups of the sphere spectrum can be determined entirely from the motivic homotopy groups of the $p$-completed sphere spectra and the motivic cohomology of the ground field, except possibly for the $0$ and $-1$-stems. Using this, we show that the complex realization map from the motivic cohomology group to the classical stable homotopy group is an isomorphism in a range of bidegrees. We apply this to deduce that complex realization also induces isomorphisms on unstable homotopy groups for Stiefel varieties $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n_k)$ in a range of bidegrees. This allows a complete solution of the question of when the projection map $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n_k) \to V_1(\mathbb{A}^n_k)$ admits a right inverse. Equivalently, this settles the question of when the universal stably-free module of type $(n,n-1)$ admits a free summand of given rank.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resistant Cryptography via Universal Gr\"obner Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the use of universal Gr\"obner bases in public-key cryptography by proposing a key establishment protocol that is resistant to quantum attacks. By utilizing a universal Gr\"obner basis $\mathcal{U}_I$ of a polynomial ideal $I$ as a private key, this protocol leverages the computational disparity between generating the universal Gr\"obner basis needed for decryption compared with the single Gr\"obner basis used for encryption. The security of the system lies in the difficulty of directly computing the Gr\"obner fan of $I$ required to construct $\mathcal{U}_I$. We provide an analysis of the security of the protocol and the complexity of its various parameters. Additionally, we provide efficient ways to recursively generate $\mathcal{U}_I$ for toric ideals of graphs with techniques which are also of independent interest to the study of these ideals.</description>

      <title>$F$-divided bundles on normal $F$-finite schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study $F$-divided bundles on irreducible Noetherian normal $F$-finite $\mathbb{F}_p$-schemes and we show that their Tannakian category is governed by the behaviour at the generic point. In particular, if $U\subset X$ is an open subset of a normal variety defined over an algebraically closed field then the corresponding homomorphism of $F$-divided fundamental groups is faithfully flat. This is analogous to a known fact about the topological fundamental group of an open subset of a normal complex analytic variety. We use this result to show that simply connected, proper, normal varieties in positive characteristic admit no nontrivial $F$-divided bundles. This generalizes an earlier result of H. Esnault and V. Mehta concerning smooth projective varieties, and settles Gieseker's conjecture in a more general setting.</description>

      <title>The border rank of the $4 \times 4$ determinant tensor is twelve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the border rank of the $4 \times 4$ determinant tensor is at least $12$ over $\mathbb{C}$, using the fixed ideal theorem introduced by Buczy\'nska-Buczy\'nski and the method by Conner-Harper-Landsberg. Together with the known upper bound, this implies that the border rank is exactly $12$.</description>

      <title>Sequentially Cohen-Macaulay Co-Chordal Graphs: Structure and Projective Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of chordal graphs called ($d_1$,$d_2$,$\dots$,$d_q$)-trees. A graph belongs to this class if and only if its clique complex is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay, providing a complete classification of all sequentially Cohen-Macaulay co-chordal graphs. This class also yields a classification of bi-sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graphs. We study the relationship between the projective dimension of a graph and its maximum vertex degree. We show that the projective dimension is always at least the maximum vertex degree, although this bound is not always tight, even for co-chordal graphs. However, equality holds when the graph is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay co-chordal or has a full vertex.</description>

      <title>Computing Flat-Injective Presentations of Multigraded Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A \emph{flat-injective presentation} of a persistence module $M$ characterizes $M$ as the image of a morphism from a flat to an injective persistence module. Like flat or injective presentations, flat-injective presentations can be easily represented by a single \emph{monomial matrix}, completely describe the persistence module, and can be used as starting point to compute other invariants of it, such as the rank invariant, persistence images, and others.
  If $M$ has finite total dimension, then it has a finite free resolution $F_\bullet$ and a finite injective resolution $I^\bullet$, and a flat-injective presentation of $M$ is given by the morphism $\phi\colon F_0 \to I^0$. We present an algorithm to compute a monomial matrix representing $\phi$ from the matrices representing $F_\bullet$ (or $I^\bullet$), using a simple correspondence between free and injective resolutions of $M$. The algorithm, of which an implementation is available at \cite{FlangePresentations.jl}, has cubic run time in the total rank of $F_\bullet$.</description>

      <title>Generation of singularity categories and infinite injective dimension locus via annihilation of cohomologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring. We establish a close relationship between the strong generation of the singularity category of R and the nonvanishing of the annihilator of the singularity category of R. As an application, we prove that the singularity category of R has a strong generator if and only if the annihilator of the singularity category of R is nonzero when R is a Noetherian domain with Krull dimension at most one. We introduce the notion of the co-cohomological annihilator of modules. If the category of finitely generated R-modules has a strong generator, we show that the infinite injective dimension locus of a finitely generated R-module M is closed, with the defining ideal given by the co-cohomological annihilator of M. Finally, we provide a connection between the existence of an extension generator of the category of finitely generated R-modules and the finiteness of the Krull dimension of R.</description>

      <title>Relatively big projective modules and their applications to direct sum decompositions</title>

Abstract: Countably generated projective modules that are relatively big with respect to a trace ideal were introduced by P. P\v{r}\'ihoda, as an extension of Bass' uniformly big projectives. It has already been proved that there are a number of interesting examples of rings whose countably generated projective modules are always relatively big. In this paper, we increase the list of such examples, showing that it includes all right noetherian rings satisfying a polynomial identity.
  We also show that countably generated projective modules over locally semiperfect torsion-free algebras over $h$-local domains are always relatively big. This last result applies to endomorphism rings of finitely generated torsion-free modules over $h$-local domains. As a consequence, we can give a complete characterization of those $h$-local domains of Krull dimension $1$ for which every direct summand of a direct sum of copies of a single finitely generated torsion-free module is again a direct sum of finitely generated modules.</description>
