      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Parameterized Nonlinear Fluid Dynamical Systems with a Dynamics-embedded Conditional Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a data-driven solution to accurately predict parameterized nonlinear fluid dynamical systems using a dynamics-generator conditional GAN (Dyn-cGAN) as a surrogate model. The Dyn-cGAN includes a dynamics block within a modified conditional GAN, enabling the simultaneous identification of temporal dynamics and their dependence on system parameters. The learned Dyn-cGAN model takes into account the system parameters to predict the flow fields of the system accurately. We evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of the developed Dyn-cGAN through numerical studies of various parameterized nonlinear fluid dynamical systems, including flow over a cylinder and a 2-D cavity problem, with different Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, we examine how Reynolds number affects the accuracy of the predictions for both case studies. Additionally, we investigate the impact of the number of time steps involved in the process of dynamics block training on the accuracy of predictions, and we find that an optimal value exists based on errors and mutual information relative to the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Quantum Distinction of Regular and Chaotic Classical Dynamics in Dissipative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chaos has recently received increasing attention due to its relationship with experimental and theoretical studies of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, thermalization, and the scrambling of quantum information. In an isolated system, quantum chaos refers to properties of the spectrum that emerge when the classical counterpart of the system is chaotic. However, despite experimental progress leading to longer coherence times, interactions with an environment can never be neglected, which calls for a definition of quantum chaos in dissipative systems. Advances in this direction were brought by the Grobe-Haake-Sommers (GHS) conjecture, which connects chaos in a dissipative classical system with cubic repulsion of the eigenvalues of the quantum counterpart and regularity with linear level repulsion. Here, we show that the GHS conjecture does not hold for the open Dicke model, which is a spin-boson model of experimental interest. We show that the onset of cubic level repulsion in the open quantum model is not always related with chaotic structures in the classical limit. This result challenges the universality of the GHS conjecture and raises the question of what is the source of spectral correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos on the separatrix of the periodically perturbed Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation between a classical periodic Hamiltonian system and an associated discrete quantum system on a torus in phase space. The model is a sinusoidally perturbed Harper model and is similar to the sinusoidally perturbed pendulum. Separatrices connecting hyperbolic fixed points in the unperturbed classical system become chaotic under sinusoidal perturbation. We numerically compute eigenstates of the Floquet propagator for the associated quantum system. For each Floquet eigenstate we compute a Husimi distribution in phase space and an energy and energy dispersion from the expectation value of the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator. The Husimi distribution of each Floquet eigenstate resembles a classical orbit with a similar energy and similar energy dispersion. Chaotic orbits in the classical system are related to Floquet eigenstates that appear ergodic. For a hybrid regular and chaotic system, we use the energy dispersion to separate the Floquet eigenstates into ergodic and integrable subspaces. The distribution of quasi-energies in the ergodic subspace resembles that of a random matrix model. The width of a chaotic region in the classical system is estimated by integrating the perturbation along a separatrix orbit. We derive a related expression for the associated quantum system from the averaged perturbation in the interaction representation evaluated at states with energy close to the separatrix.</description>
