      <title>A recollement of differential graded categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that given a differential graded category C and B a full differential graded subcategory closed under coproducts, there is a canonical recollement of differential graded categories, for which we use enriched categories tools. We continue the study of differential graded triangular matrix categories as initiated in [22]. We show that given a recollement between functor dg-categories we can induce a new recollement between differential graded triangular matrix categories, this is a generalization of a result given by Chen and Zheng in [5, Theorem 4.4].</description>

      <title>The elliptic Hall algebra and the double Dyck path algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the positive half $\mathcal{E}_{q,t}^{&gt;}$ of the elliptic Hall algebra is embedded as a natural spherical subalgebra inside the double Dyck path algebra $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$ introduced by Carlsson, Mellit and the second author. For this, we use the Ding-Iohara-Miki presentation of the elliptic Hall algebra and identify the generators inside $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$. In order to obtain the entire elliptic Hall algebra $\mathcal{E}_{q,t}$, we define a ``double'' $\mathbb{DB}_{q,t}$ of the double Dyck path algebra, together with its positive and negative subalgebras and an involution that exchanges them.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components of affine Lusztig varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\breve{G}$ be a loop group and $\tilde W$ be its Iwahori-Weyl group. The affine Lusztig variety $Y_w(\gamma)$ describes the intersection of the Bruhat cell $\mathcal{I} \dot{w} \mathcal{I}$ for $w \in \tilde W$ with the conjugacy class of $\gamma \in \breve{G}$, while the affine Deligne-Lusztig variety $X_w(b)$ describes the intersection of the Bruhat cell $\mathcal{I} \dot{w} \mathcal{I}$ with the Frobenius-twisted conjugacy class of $b \in \breve{G}$. Although the geometric connections between these varieties are unknown, numerical relations exist in their geometric properties.
  This paper explores the irreducible components of affine Lusztig varieties. The centralizer of $\g$ acts on $Y_w(\g)$ and the Frobenius-twisted centralizer of $b$ acts on $X_w(b)$. We relate the number of orbits on the top-dimensional components of $Y_w(\gamma)$ to the numbers of orbits on top-dimensional components of $X_w(b)$ and the affine Springer fibers. For split groups and elements $\gamma$ with integral Newton points, we show that, for most $w$, the numbers of orbits for the affine Lusztig variety and the associated affine Deligne-Lusztig variety match. Moreover, for these $\g$, we verify Chi's conjecture that the number of top-dimensional components in $Y_\mu(\gamma)$ within the affine Grassmannian equals to the dimension of a specific weight space in a representation of the Langlands dual group.</description>

      <title>Hall Polynomials for Weighted projective lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the triangle singularity defined by the \linebreak equation $f=X_1^{p_1}+X_2^{p_2}+X_3^{p_3}$ for weight triple $(p_1,p_2,p_3)$, as well as the category of coherent sheaves over the weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ defined by $f$. We calculate Hall polynomials associated to extensions bundles, line bundles and torsion sheaves over $\mathbb{X}$. By using derived equivalence, this provides a unified conceptual method for calculating Hall polynomials for representations of tame quivers obtained by Sz\'ant\'o and Sz\"oll\H{o}si [J. Pure Appl. Alg. {\bf 228} (2024)].</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras are determined by their monoidal derived categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two finite-dimensional Hopf algebras are gauge equivalent if and only if their bounded derived categories are monoidal triangulated equivalent. More generally, a monoidal derived equivalence between locally finite tensor Grothendieck categories induces a monoidal abelian equivalence.</description>

      <title>Covering theory, functor categories and the Krull-Gabriel dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that $K$ is an algebraically closed field, $R$ a locally bounded $K$-category, $G$ an admissible group of $K$-linear automorphisms of $R$ and $F:R\rightarrow A$ the Galois $G$-covering functor. In the first part of the paper we show that $KG(R)\leq KG(A)$ where $KG$ denotes the Krull-Gabriel dimension. This result is proved by developing the Galois covering theory of functor categories, based on the existence of the general tensor product bifunctor. We understand this theory as the theory of the left and the right adjoint functors $\Phi,\Theta:MOD(\mathcal{R})\rightarrow MOD(\mathcal{A})$ to the pull-up functor $\Psi=(F_{\lambda})_{\bullet}:MOD(\mathcal{A})\rightarrow MOD(\mathcal{R})$, along the push-down functor $F_{\lambda}:\mathcal{R}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}$ where $\mathcal{R}=mod(R)$, $\mathcal{A}=mod(A)$ and $(F_{\lambda})_{\bullet}=(-)\circ F_{\lambda}$. In the case $F_{\lambda}$ is dense, $\Phi$ and $\Theta$ are natural generalizations of the classical push-down functors. Generally, $\Phi$ and $\Theta$ restrict to categories $\mathcal{F}(R),\mathcal{F}(A)$ of finitely presented functors and the restricted functors coincide. In the second part of the paper, we show that $\Phi:\mathcal{F}(R)\rightarrow\mathcal{F}(A)$ is a Galois $G$-precovering of functor categories. Next we consider an important special case when $R$ is simply connected locally representation-finite. Then $\Phi$ may be studied in terms of classical covering theory which allows to give an example of $\Phi$ which is not dense. This justifies the introduction of the functors of the first and the second kind, following the terminology of Dowbor and Skowro\'nski. In the final part of the paper, we give special applications of our results. Last but not least, we discuss applications to the conjecture of M. Prest, relating the Krull-Gabriel dimension of an algebra with its representation type.</description>

      <title>Linnik problem for Maass--Hecke cuspforms and effective multiplicity one theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two related problems concerning the dimension of joint eigenspaces of the Laplace--Beltrami operator and a finite set of Hecke operators on $\mathbb{X}=\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathbb{H}$. First, we consider Linnik problem for Maass--Hecke cuspforms. We prove that the dimension of such a joint eigenspace, for Maass--Hecke cuspforms with eigenparameter in $[T, T+1]$, associated to Hecke operators $T_p$ with $p &lt; (\log T)^\alpha$ is $O_\epsilon (T^{{\frac{4}{\alpha}} + \epsilon})$. For this, we prove a new form of spectral large sieve inequality for symmetric-squares of Maass--Hecke cuspforms, by exploiting the fact that the forms under consideration are unramified at every non-archimedean place.
  Second, we consider the effective multiplicity one problem, determining the minimal number of Hecke eigenvalues needed to distinguish two Maass--Hecke cusp forms with the same Laplace eigenvalue. We prove that for any fixed $\eta&gt;0$, if two Maass--Hecke cuspforms, with eigenparameter $t$, share Hecke eigenvalues $\lambda_{\phi_1}(n) = \lambda_{\phi_2}(n)$ for all $n &lt; \eta t$, and $t$ is sufficiently large, then the forms are proportional. This improves the previously known best bound due to Huntley in 1991. Key ingredient for the improvement is the result by Brook and Lindenstrauss that classifies quantum limits of a joint eigenfunction of a Hecke operator and the Laplace--Beltrami operator on arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces.
  We also discuss generalizations of these results to Maass--Hecke cuspforms on $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ over arbitrary number field.</description>

      <title>K-theory and Lefschetz formula for locally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semi-simple real Lie group of real rank one and $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup in $G$ such that $\Gamma \backslash G$ has finite volume. We introduce a new group $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(G, \Gamma)$, which provides a natural framework for defining index classes of Dirac-type operators on the locally symmetirc space $\Gamma \backslash G /K$. We show that Dirac operators define elements in the $K$-theory of $C^*_r(G, \Gamma)$ and use Hecke correspondences to study their Lefschetz numbers. Our main result is an explicit formula for the Lefschetz number of Hecke operators.</description>

      <title>Cohomology theory of Nijenhuis Lie algebras and (generic) Nijenhuis Lie bialgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. In the first part, we define the cohomology of a Nijenhuis Lie algebra with coefficients in a suitable representation. Our cohomology of a Nijenhuis Lie algebra governs the simultaneous deformations of the underlying Lie algebra and the Nijenhuis operator. Subsequently, we define homotopy Nijenhuis operators on $2$-term $L_\infty$-algebras and show that in some cases they are related to third cocycles of Nijenhuis Lie algebras. In another part of this paper, we extend our study to (generic) Nijenhuis Lie bialgebras where the Nijenhuis operators on the underlying Lie algebras and Lie coalgebras need not be the same. In due course, we introduce matched pairs and Manin triples of Nijenhuis Lie algebras and show that they are equivalent to Nijenhuis Lie bialgebras. Finally, we consider the admissible classical Yang-Baxter equation whose antisymmetric solutions yield Nijenhuis Lie bialgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a faithful representation $W$ of a finite group $G$, we classify when the invariant subring of the tensor algebra $T(W)$ is noetherian/finitely generated as a twisted commutative algebra (tca). For a representation $W$ of a classical group $G_{\mathbb{Z}}$, we show that the invariant subring $T(W_k)^{G_k}$ is a finitely generated tca for $k$ algebraically closed of sufficiently large characteristics, assuming $W$ admits a good filtration over $\mathbb{Z}$. Finally, we introduce a categorical variant of the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension and compute its value to be $\binom{n+1}{2}$ for $T(\mathbb{C}^n)$ as a tca.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the action of local conformal transformations on several measures related to the Gaussian free field and Schramm--Loewner evolutions. The main novelty of our work is a Cameron--Martin-type formula for the welding homeomorphism of the SLE loop measure ($\kappa\in(0,4]$); its proof relies on a rigorous interpretation (and computation) of the "Jacobian" of the conformal welding map, which we relate to the "$bc$-ghost system" from bosonic string theory. We also give an intrinsic definition of the trace of the GFF on SLE, and prove a characterisation of the free boundary GFF in $\mathbb{D}$. As an application, we introduce a new and intrinsic approach to the conformal welding of quantum surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We develop an explicit version of the Kuznetsov trace formula for GSp(4), relating sums of Fourier coefficients to Kloosterman sums. We study the precise analytic behaviour of both the spectral and the arithmetic transforms arising in the Kuznetsov trace formula for GSp(4). We use these results to provide an effective version of the trace formula, and establish various results on the family of Maa{\ss} automorphic forms on GSp(4) in the spectral aspect: the Weyl law, a density result on the non-tempered spectrum, large sieve inequalities, bounds on the second moment of the spinor and standard $L$-functions, as well as a statement on the distribution of the low-lying zeros of these $L$-functions, determining the associated types of symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1501.01260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the representation theory of filtered algebras with commutative associated graded whose spectrum has finitely many symplectic leaves. Examples are provided by the algebras of global sections of quantizations of symplectic resolutions, quantum Hamiltonian reductions, spherical symplectic reflection algebras. We introduce the notion of holonomic modules for such algebras. We show that the generalized Bernstein inequality holds for simple modules and turns into equality for holonomic simples provided the algebraic fundamental groups of all leaves are finite. Under the same assumption, we prove that the associated variety of a simple holonomic module is equi-dimensional. We also prove that, if the regular bimodule has finite length or if the algebra in question is a quantum Hamiltonian reduction, then any holonomic module has finite length. This allows to reduce the Bernstein inequality for arbitrary modules to simple ones. We prove that the regular bimodule has finite length for the global sections of quantizations of symplectic resolutions and for Rational Cherednik algebras. The paper contains a joint appendix by the author and Etingof that motivates the definition of a holonomic module in the case of global sections of a quantization of a symplectic resolution.</description>

In the first part of the paper, we prove the universal property of pretriangulated orbit categories of dg categories first stated by the second-named author in 2005. We deduce that the passage to an orbit category commutes with suitable dg quotients. We apply these results to study collapsing of grading for (higher) cluster categories constructed from bigraded Calabi-Yau completions as introduced by Ikeda-Qiu.
  The second part of the paper is motivated by the construction of cluster categories as (co)singularity categories. We show that, for any dg algebra $A$, its perfect derived category can be realized in two ways: firstly, as an (enlarged) cluster category of a certain differential bigraded algebra, generalizing a result of Ikeda-Qiu, and secondly as a (shrunk) singularity category of another differential bigraded algebra, generalizing a result of Happel following Hanihara. We relate these two descriptions using a version of relative Koszul duality.</description>

      <title>A geometric realization for maximal almost pre-rigid representations over type $\mathbb{D}$ quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03395v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the equivariant theory of group actions, we give a geometric model for the category of finite dimensional representations over a type $\mathbb{D}$ quiver $Q_{D}$ with $n$ vertices and directional symmetry. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of maximal almost pre-rigid representations over $Q_{D}$, which form a family of objects counted by the generalized Catalan number. We present a geometric realization for maximal almost pre-rigid representations and prove that the endomorphism algebras of maximal almost pre-rigid representations are tilted algebras of type $Q_{\overline{D}}$, where $Q_{\overline{D}}$ is a quiver obtained by adding $n-2$ new vertices and $n-2$ arrows to the quiver $Q_{D}$. Additionally, we define a partial order on the set of maximal almost pre-rigid representations, which therefore presents a representation-theoretic interpretation of the type-$\mathbb{D}$ Cambrian lattice determined by $Q_{D}$. Meanwhile, we obtain a representation-theoretic interpretation of the type-$\mathbb{B}$ Cambrian lattices.</description>

      <title>Group actions on relative cluster categories and Higgs categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group acting on an ice quiver with potential $(Q, F, W)$. We construct the corresponding $G$-equivariant relative cluster category and $G$-equivariant Higgs category, extending the work of Demonet. Using the orbit mutations on the set of $G$-stable cluster-tilting objects of the Higgs category and an appropriate cluster character, we can link these data to an explicit skew-symmetrizable cluster algebra with coefficients. As a specific example, this provides an additive categorification for cluster algebras with principal coefficients in the non-simply laced case.</description>

      <title>Basics on positively multiplicative graphs and algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An oriented graph is said positively multiplicative when its adjacency matrix $A$ embeds in a matrix algebra admitting a basis $\mathsf{B}$ with nonnegative structure constants in which the matrix of the multiplication by $A$ coincides with $A$. The goal of this paper is to present basic properties of this notion and explain, through various simple examples, how it relates to highly non trivial problems like the combinatorial description of fusion rules, the description of the minimal boundary of graded graphs or the study of random walks on alcove tilings.</description>

      <title>Canonical representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g,n}$ be an orientable surface of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures. We study actions of the mapping class group of $\Sigma_{g,n}$ via Hodge-theoretic and arithmetic techniques. We show that if $$\rho: \pi_1(\Sigma_{g,n})\to GL_r(\mathbb{C})$$ is a representation whose conjugacy class has finite orbit under the mapping class group, and $r&lt;\sqrt{g+1}$, then $\rho$ has finite image. This answers questions of Junho Peter Whang and Mark Kisin. We give applications of our methods to the Putman-Wieland conjecture, the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, and a question of Esnault-Kerz.
  The proofs rely on non-abelian Hodge theory, our earlier work on semistability of isomonodromic deformations, and recent work of Esnault-Groechenig and Klevdal-Patrikis on Simpson's integrality conjecture for cohomologically rigid local systems.</description>

      <title>An $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree and $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$ Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey chain of Andrews, Schilling and the author is extended to a four-parameter $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree. As main application of this tree, we prove the Kanade-Russell conjecture for a three-parameter family of Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities related to the principal characters of the affine Lie algebra $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$. Combined with known $q$-series results, this further implies an $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$-analogue of the celebrated Andrews-Gordon $q$-series identities. We also use the $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree to prove a Rogers-Selberg-type identity for the characters of the principal subspaces of $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$ indexed by arbitrary level-$k$ dominant integral weights $\lambda$. This generalises a result of Feigin, Feigin, Jimbo, Miwa and Mukhin for $\lambda=k\Lambda_0$.</description>

      <title>Bohr compactification and Chu duality of non-abelian locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{Bohr compactification} of an arbitrary topological group $G$ is defined as the group compactification $(bG,b)$ with the following universal property: for every continuous homomorphism $h$ from $G$ into a compact group $K$ there is a continuous homomorphism $h^{b}$ from $bG$ into $K$ extending $h$ in the sense that $h=h^b \circ b$. The Bohr compactification $(bG,b)$ is the unique (up to equivalence) largest compactification of $G$. Although, for locally compact Abelian groups, the Bohr compactification is a big monster, for non-Abelian groups the situation is much more interesting and it can be said that all options are possible. Here we are interested in locally compact groups whose Bohr compactification is \emph{small}. Among other results, we characterize when the Bohr the Bohr compactification of a locally compact group is topologically isomorphic to its Chu or unitary quasi-dual. Our results fixe some incorrect statements appeared in the literature.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for the Theta Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theta process is a stochastic process of number theoretical origin arising as a scaling limit of quadratic Weyl sums. It can be described in terms of the geodesic flow and an automorphic function on a homogeneous space. This process has several properties in common with Brownian motion such as its H\"older regularity, uncorrelated increments and quadratic variation. However, crucially, we show that the theta process is not a semimartingale, making It\^o calculus techniques inapplicable. Instead, we use the celebrated rough paths theory to develop the stochastic calculus for the theta process. We do so by constructing the iterated integrals - the ``rough path" - above the theta process. Rough paths theory takes a signal and its iterated integrals and produces a vast and robust theory of stochastic differential equations. In addition, the rough path we construct can be described in terms of higher rank theta sums, via equidistribution of horocycle lifts.</description>

      <title>Bialgebra theory for nearly associative algebras and $LR$-algebras: equivalence, characterization, and $LR$-Yang-Baxter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the bialgebra theory for two classes of non-associative algebras: nearly associative algebras and $LR$-algebras. In particular, building on recent studies that reveal connections between these algebraic structures, we establish that nearly associative bialgebras and $LR$-bialgebras are, in fact, equivalent concepts. We also provide a characterization of these bialgebra classes based on the coproduct. Moreover, since the development of nearly associative bialgebras - and by extension, $LR$-bialgebras - requires the framework of nearly associative $L$-algebras, we introduce this class of non-associative algebras and explore their fundamental properties. Furthermore, we identify and characterize a special class of nearly associative bialgebras, the coboundary nearly associative bialgebras, which provides a natural framework for studying the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE) within this context.</description>

      <title>On retract rationality for finite connected group schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we prove the retract rationality of the classifying spaces $BG$ for several types of finite connected group schemes $G$ over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic $p&gt;0$. In particular, we prove the retract rationality for the finite simple group schemes $G$ associated with the generalized Witt algebras in specific cases. To this end, we study the automorphism group schemes of the generalized Witt algebras and establish triangulations for them. Moreover, we extend the notion of Witt--Ree algebra to general base rings and discuss their properties.</description>

      <title>The construction of a class of presentations for Specht modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build on the methods introduced by Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley, and Wachs, and further developed by Brauner and Friedmann, to construct additional classes of presentations of Specht modules. We obtain these presentations by defining a linear operator which is a symmetrized sum of dual Garnir relations on the space of column tabloids. Our presentations apply to the vast majority of shapes of Specht modules.</description>
