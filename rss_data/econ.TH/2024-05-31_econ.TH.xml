      <title>Cheap Talking Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07867v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate behaviour of two independent reinforcement learning algorithms playing the Crawford and Sobel (1982) game of strategic information transmission. We adopt memoryless algorithms to capture learning in a static game where a large population interacts anonymously. We show that sender and receiver converge to Nash equilibrium play. The level of informativeness of the sender's cheap talk decreases as the bias increases and, at intermediate level of the bias, it matches the level predicted by the Pareto optimal equilibrium or by the second best one. Conclusions are robust to alternative specifications of the learning hyperparameters and of the game.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>

Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>

      <title>The Relative Value of Prediction in Algorithmic Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic predictions are increasingly used to inform the allocations of goods and interventions in the public sphere. In these domains, predictions serve as a means to an end. They provide stakeholders with insights into likelihood of future events as a means to improve decision making quality, and enhance social welfare. However, if maximizing welfare is the ultimate goal, prediction is only a small piece of the puzzle. There are various other policy levers a social planner might pursue in order to improve bottom-line outcomes, such as expanding access to available goods, or increasing the effect sizes of interventions.
  Given this broad range of design decisions, a basic question to ask is: What is the relative value of prediction in algorithmic decision making? How do the improvements in welfare arising from better predictions compare to those of other policy levers? The goal of our work is to initiate the formal study of these questions. Our main results are theoretical in nature. We identify simple, sharp conditions determining the relative value of prediction vis-\`a-vis expanding access, within several statistical models that are popular amongst quantitative social scientists. Furthermore, we illustrate how these theoretical insights may be used to guide the design of algorithmic decision making systems in practice.</description>
