      <title>Frequency multiplication in Terahertz band using AlGaN/GaN plasmonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasma oscillations in high-mobility field-effect transistors (HEMTs) have emerged as a key physical mechanism for manipulating electromagnetic radiation in the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) and THz frequency ranges. These collective electron excitations can be excited and tuned electrically offering a compelling route to compact, integrable components for a wide range of next-generation technologies, including sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, high-resolution biomedical and chemical spectroscopy, industrial process monitoring, and advanced security and defense systems. For these applications, plasmonic crystals -- periodic arrays of many strongly coupled FET channels-- are particularly promising. In this work, we report on a new class of collective excitations in plasmonic crystals termed rotonic plasmons, which arise at plasmonic mode crossings and exhibit a parabolic dispersion law reminiscent of soft-mode and roton-like spectra. We show that uniform gate modulation across plasmonic crystal unit cells induces periodic variations in the sheet carrier concentration and, consequently, in the plasma frequency. This time-periodic modulation drives nonlinear plasmonic parametric resonances enabling RF-to-THz conversion. By solving the generalized Mathieu equation with damping, we demonstrate that high-amplitude gate pumping enables frequency multiplication and, at cryogenic temperatures (77K) leads to parametric instabilities due to enhanced electron mobility. In plasmonic crystals with lower mobility, RF-to-THz conversion can instead be realized via periodic short-pulse excitation, a regime we introduce as Time-Domain Frequency Multiplication (TDFM). Investigation of AlGaN/GaN low-high plasmonic crystals confirm their potential as tunable, compact THz sources.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Brilliant source of 19.2 attosecond soft X-ray pulses below the atomic unit of time"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent preprint by Ardana-Lamas et al. (Ref. [1], arXiv:2510.04086) re-analyzes the data set of the attosecond streaking experiment on krypton atoms originally reported in Phys Rev X 7, 041030 (2017) [2], and claims the characterization of a 19.2 attosecond light pulse with an overall photon flux of 4.8*10^10 photons per second. In this comment, we highlight a series of physical and technical issues concerning both the original experiment [2] and the new characterization [1]. Specifically, without accounting for the contribution of Auger electrons or employing filters to remove low-energy harmonics and compensate for the intrinsic pulse chirp, the authors attribute the measured photoelectrons predominantly to the 3d inner-shell orbital of krypton and claim to have retrieved a nearly chirp-free pulse based on the single atomic orbital. In comparison with our recent attosecond streaking experiments on krypton atoms, these physical and technical issues raise significant doubts about the validity of the characterization results.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Switch Using an Array of Subwavelength Metallic Holes-coupled-disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband switching of terahertz waves at room temperature is demonstrated using a reconfigurable subwavelength metallic hole coupled disk array. The interaction between a metallic membrane featuring periodically arranged circular holes and a substrate bearing a correspondingly periodic array of metallic disks - precisely aligned at their centers - significantly enhances the light coupling within each individual metallic structure, leading to an improved optical transmission and the appearance of a new transmission peak. By mechanical displacement of the metallic membrane with respect to the substrate with metallic disks, the light transmission through the structure can be reconfigured. The device exhibits a polarization-insensitive high-contrast switching performance of 89.4 dB at 942 GHz. The full-width at half-maximum bandwidth of the switch is 288 GHz. By proper design of the device's geometric dimensions, the operation frequency and bandwidth of the switch can be scaled.</description>

      <title>Mechanically Reconfigurable Terahertz Bandpass Filter Based on Double-Layered Subwavelength Metallic Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable bandpass terahertz filters are demanded in various key applications such as hyperspectral imagers, miniaturized spectrometers, and high-speed wireless communication systems. Here, a mechanically reconfigurable double-layered subwavelength metallic structure is presented for frequency-agile terahertz transmission bandpass filtering. The theoretically demonstrated polarization-insensitive filter shows remarkable performance metrics. By varying the vertical interlayer spacing of the metallic layers from 20 um to 4 um, the operation frequency tunes from 0.81 THz to 1.32 THz, and the full width at half maximum bandwidth changes from 209 GHz to 135 GHz, with maximum transmission efficiency greater than 98% and quality factor ranging between 3.88 and 9.77. A larger variation range of the vertical interlayer spacing leads to an enhanced frequency tuning range of the filter. Furthermore, simultaneous vertical and lateral interlayer displacements can provide polarization-dependent behavior for the filter. The underlying physical mechanism governing the filter's frequency response and tuning capability is analyzed by examining the electromagnetic field distributions within the double-layered subwavelength metallic structure and its Fabry-Perot-like behavior. The presented scheme holds significant promise for many terahertz applications due to its large tuning range, easy tuning mechanism, simple structure, and compatibility with fabrication materials and processes.</description>

      <title>Universal loss and gain characterization inside photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonics has undergone tremendous development in the past few decades, transforming many fields of study in science and technology. Loss and gain are two fundamental elements in photonic circuits and have direct impacts on nearly all key performance metrics. Surprisingly, the tools to characterize the optical loss and gain inside photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are very limited. This is because, unlike free-space or fiber optics, integrated circuits cannot be nondestructively disassembled. Here, we report a universal method to see inside the photonic integrated circuits and measure loss and gain on the component level nondestructively. The method leverages nonlinear optical devices as optical power discriminators to retrieve the loss and gain information inside the PICs. Our method has a precision better than 0.1 dB, and can characterize the loss of individual fiber-chip coupling facet and general unknown devices under test. As a demonstration of applications, we measured the true on-chip quantum efficiency of a quantum PIC consisting of heterogeneously integrated balanced photodiodes, a critical building block for integrated quantum technology. Our method can be implemented on different photonic platforms, and can be used to understand gain and loss in complex photonic circuits, which is essential to optimize circuit design and to create large-scale systems with predictable, reproducible performance.</description>

      <title>Robust and Hyper-Efficient Multi-dimensional Optical Fiber Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demands of artificial intelligence and immersive media require communication beyond bit-level accuracy to meaning awareness. Conventional optical systems that focused on syntactic precision suffer significant inefficiencies. Here, we introduce a multi-dimensional semantic communication framework that bridges this gap by directly mapping high-level semantic features onto the orthogonal physical dimensions of light, frequency, polarization, and intensity, within a multimode fiber. This synergistic co-design of semantic logic and the photonic channel achieve an unprecedented equivalent spectral efficiency approaching 1000 bit/s/Hz. Moreover, it demonstrates profound resilience, maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction even when the physical-layer symbol error rate exceeds 36%, a condition under which conventional communication systems fail completely. Crucially, this deeply integrated co-design of semantic encoding and physical-layer modulation enables full semantic demodulation with only single-ended intensity detection, therefore significantly reducing system complexity and cost. This work establishes a validated pathway toward hyper-efficient, error-resilient optical networks for the next generation of data-intensive computing.</description>

      <title>Galilean Invariance in the Characterization of Light Drag in Moving Atomic Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light experiences drag effects when it propagates through a moving medium. The study of light drag has provided foundational insights into light-matter interactions. While longitudinal drag has been extensively characterized, transverse drag, where the medium moves perpendicular to the light's propagation, is subtler and requires advanced techniques for detection. In this work, we experimentally investigate transverse drag in a highly dispersive slow-light medium using non-degenerate Zeeman electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in rubidium vapor. By systematically comparing configurations where the light beam and the medium serve as the moving frame, we leverage Galilean invariance to analyze transverse light-drag in this optical context. Thus, we provide a platform for future tests of fundamental principles on strong experimental grounds, which offers promising applications in precision velocimetry, accelerometry, quantum information, and light storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Geometric Manifold Statistics of Turbulence-Impacted Beam Propagation and Compensation in Optical Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study extends the analysis of turbulence-affected beam statistics through a manifold-based statistical framework that unifies probabilistic modeling with geometric interpretation. The spatial intensity distributions, distorted by dynamic turbulence, are represented using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), whose probability landscapes are refined via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) applied to pixel-level intensity data across temporal frames. The temporal evolution of turbulence is quantified by monitoring the variation of the unnormalized volumetric integrals under the GMM surfaces, providing a continuous measure of power redistribution within the optical field. Experimental investigations were carried out under four propagation conditions: turbulence-free reference, turbulence only, turbulence with a single PMMA compensator, and turbulence with dual PMMA compensators. To assess statistical dissimilarity, Affine-Invariant Riemannian Metric (AIRM) distances were computed between the covariance representations of successive frames, capturing the geometric evolution of beam topology in the space of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. Complementary topological distance analyses, performed with respect to the initial frame of each set, revealed distinct signatures of turbulence-induced aberrations and their progressive mitigation through dielectric compensation. The observed reduction in inter-frame distance metrics confirms the ability of coupled dipole interactions within PMMA slabs to partially restore statistical coherence in turbulence-distorted optical beams.</description>

      <title>Sub-Pixel Scale Structured Illumination for Lateral Resolution Enhancement of Non-Diffraction-Limited Flow Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fluid flow imaging, intensity gradients are a good measure of spatial variations in scalar properties, which play an important role in controlling transport processes. However, current flow imaging techniques exhibit system-limited spatial resolutions, thus inhibiting the ability to accurately detect intensity gradients. To address this challenge, we present a method and system, inspired by Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), which can be implemented in dynamic flow imaging to enhance pixel resolution and, thereby, the estimation of scalar gradients. We utilize sub-pixel-scale patterned light matching the system pixel scale and multi-frame imaging that creates quasi-static images over four frames, with scalability for high-speed imaging. These multi-frame images are then processed using a bespoke recombination algorithm that produces a new image with twice the pixel resolution compared to the original images. The sub-pixel spatial-resolution enhancement capabilities are shown with static images and dynamic fluid flow, for which enhancement in the flow gradient is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Time-Multiplexed Electronic Control of a Silicon Photonic Coherent Adder for Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of reconfigurable photonic circuits, made possible by the established maturity of silicon photonic foundries, demands efficient strategies to monitor and actively control the optical functionality at runtime. In this work, we show that both the readout of integrated sensors and the driving of actuators can be performed with a time-multiplexed addressing scheme, that drastically reduces the number of electrical connections required to interface the chip to the external hardware. This approach is achieved by monolithically integrating the electronic circuits needed to serialize/deserialize the feedback action directly on the photonic chip. We experimentally validate the proposed strategy with a silicon photonic coherent adder, showing that such time-multiplexed control does not introduce any penalty in the optical functionality. The circuit operation is then validated in a joint communication and sensing scenario, where the coherent adder is used to simultaneously receive a 25 Gbps high-speed transmission and to measure the phase difference between the input light beams.</description>

      <title>Computational Physics Applied to Photonic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We all know that the first laser device was realised by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Labs in 1960. Less known is that the very first computer simulations of the relaxation oscillations displayed by Maiman's laser were also performed in 1960 on a digital IBM 704 computer. The reason is that lasers and almost all photonic devices are described by nonlinear equations that are more often than not impossible to be solved analytically, i.e. on a piece of paper. Since then the development and applications of lasers and photonic devices has progressed hand in hand with computer simulations and numerical programming. In this review we introduce and numerically solve the model equations for a variety of devices, lasers, lasers with modulated parameters, lasers with injection, Kerr resonators, saturable absorbers and optical parametric oscillators. By using computer simulations we demonstrate stability and instability of nonlinear solutions in these photonic devices via pitchfork, saddle-node, Hopf and Turing bifurcations; bistability, nonlinear oscillations, deterministic chaos, Turing patterns, conservative solitons; bright, dark and grey cavity solitons; frequency combs, spatial disorder, spatio-temporal chaos, defect mediated turbulence and even rogue waves. There has been a one-to-one correspondence between computer simulations of all these nonlinear features and laboratory experiments with applications in ultrafast optical communications, optical memories, neural networks, frequency standards, optical clocks, future GPS, astronomy and quantum technologies. All of this has been made possible by 'novel insights into spatio-temporal dynamics of lasers, nonlinear and quantum optical systems, achieved through the development and application of powerful techniques for small-scale computing' (2011 Occhialini Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics and Societa' Italiana di Fisica).</description>

      <title>GaN-based Resonant Cavity LEDs Fabricated by Photo-Electrochemical Etching and Micro-Transfer Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant cavity LEDs (RCLEDs) exhibit excellent temporal and spatial coherence with narrow spectral linewidth and small divergence angle, which is of great importance for micro-displays. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel method to create GaN-based RCLEDs by using photo-electrochemical etching and micro-transfer printing (MTP) technology. Through systematic optimizing of the etching conditions, highly selective etching of an InGaN multiple quantum well sacrificial layer is achieved with parasitic etching of adjacent layers being completely suppressed. The roughness of the underside of the exfoliated GaN film is only 3.3 nm. Raman spectroscopy shows that the residual stress in the released material is reduced from 0.74 GPa for the as-grown sample to -0.15 GPa. Using the MTP method, GaN coupons with a deposited upper dielectric mirror were transferred onto target substrates covered with either an Al mirror or dielectric distributed Bragg reflector to form two types of blue RCLEDs. The electroluminescence spectra of the two RCLEDs show a much narrower linewidth, reduced from 32 nm in the conventional LED to ~5 nm, together with stable peak wavelength with increasing current density, with the shift reduced from 9.3 nm to less than 1 nm. The far-field pattern is influenced by the bottom mirror, and the far-field divergence angle can be decreased to only 52{\deg} by matching the cavity and the quantum well exciton modes. This scalable approach is highly promising for the realization of compact resonant cavity devices and their use in displays and in communications.</description>

      <title>Interface States in Space-Time Photonic Crystals: Topological Origin, Propagation and Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the topology of spatiotemporal media poses a fundamental challenge: their remarkable properties stem from breaking spatial and temporal symmetries, yet this same breaking obscures their topological characterization. Here, we show that space-time symmetries persist in crystals with travelling-wave modulation, enabling the study of their topological properties and the prediction of spatiotemporal interface states. Using a Lorentz transformation to the frame comoving with the modulation, we identify a conserved joint parity-time-reversal symmetry in the new variables that enforces the quantization of the Zak phase, elevating it to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. We then calculate the associated interface states and uncover unique features arising from time-varying effects, including selective directional excitation, propagation along moving boundaries, frequency-converted replicas, and broadband amplification even in the absence of momentum gaps.</description>

      <title>Exceptional broadband absorption of nanoporous gold explained by plasmonic resonances at dangling ligaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous gold (npAu) has emerged as a potential candidate for many optical applications exploiting its large surface to volume ratio and high broadband absorption. However, the physical origin of its enhanced visible and near infrared absorption remained unclear and till now was not explicable by simplified models. Here, we have employed leveled-wave approximants to simulate the optical response of realistic npAu structures. First, our simulations reproduced well the experimental absorption spectra. Second, we identify multiple resonances in the gaps between dangling ligaments that occur at the top and bottom surfaces of npAu films as the key contribution to the broadband absorption. These resonances at the surface of npAu cannot be captured by bulk effective medium models and should be considered separately as a surface effect. The additional absorption due to dangling ligaments contributes up to 70 % to overall absorption of npAu. Our results provide deeper insights into the absorption behavior of npAu, indicating promising avenues for photocatalysis and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of Surface Passivation on the Efficiency and High-speed Modulation of III-V GaAs/AlGaAs Nanopillar Array LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: III-V semiconductor nanolight sources with deep-subwavelength dimensions ($&lt;&lt;$1 ${\mu}$m) are essential for miniaturized photonic devices such as nanoLEDs and nanolasers. However, these nanoscale emitters suffer from substantial non-radiative recombination at room temperature, resulting in low efficiency and ultrashort lifetimes ($&lt;$100 ps). Previous works have predominantly studied surface passivation of nanoLEDs under optical pumping conditions, while practical applications require electrically driven nanoLEDs. Here, we investigate the influence of surface passivation on the efficiency and high-speed modulation response of electrically pumped III-V GaAs/AlGaAs nanopillar array LEDs. Surface passivation was performed using ammonium sulphide chemical treatment followed by encapsulation with a 100 nm silicon nitride layer deposited via low-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. Time-resolved electroluminescence measurements reveal differential carrier lifetimes (${\tau}$) of ~0.61 ns for nanoarray LEDs with pillar diameters of ~440 nm, a record-long lifetime for electrically driven GaAs-based nanopillar arrays. Under low injection conditions, the devices exhibited carrier lifetimes of ~0.41 ns, indicating successful suppression of non-radiative effects and a low surface velocity, ranging from $S$~0.7$\times$10$^4$ cm/s to 2.7$\times$10$^4$ cm/s. This reveals a potential high internal quantum efficiency $IQE$~0.45 for our nanoLEDs operating under very high injection conditions, limited only by Auger recombination and self-heating effects at high current density. These miniaturized nanoLEDs with high radiative recombination efficiency and sub-ns modulation response pave the way for optical data communications, energy efficient optical interconnects, AR/VR displays, and neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Supercontinuum generation from Topological Edge Supermodes in a short SSH Photonic Crystal Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a topological photonic-crystal fiber that embeds a short Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain and supports two edge supermodes. Using full-vector modal analysis and a coupled generalized nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we show that each supermode provides an independent nonlinear channel with a distinct broadening mechanism: the even supermode features two zero-dispersion wavelengths and yields degenerate four-wave mixing sidebands, whereas the odd supermode is all-normal-dispersion and generates a smooth, flat ANDi-type continuum. Exciting a single core prepares a coherent superposition of the two supermodes; cross-phase modulation and inter-parity four-wave mixing then enable energy transfer across detunings inaccessible to either mode alone, producing the broadest and flattest spectrum with new short wavelengths components. Our results establish topology-enabled modal control as a scalable knob for engineering supercontinuum generation in short SSH topological fibers.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Supercontinuum Generation from UV to Mid-IR in Lithium Niobate Nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercontinuum light sources are widely used for applications ranging from imaging to sensing and frequency comb stabilization. The most common mechanisms for their generation rely on cubic nonlinearities, for instance in crystals, optical fibers, and integrated photonics. However, quadratic supercontinuum generation (QSCG) offers potential for enhanced energy efficiency and broader spectral coverage because of the typically much stronger nonlinearity and ability to achieve both coherent up- and down-conversion via three-wave mixing processes. Despite such potentials, demonstrations of QSCG in integrated photonic waveguides have been sparse and have barely surpassed their cubic counterparts in terms of spectral coverage and energy-efficiency. Here, we introduce a new dispersion engineering principle and experimentally demonstrate purely quadratic supercontinuum generation in lithium niobate nano-waveguides substantially outperforming previous demonstrations in integrated photonics. In one device, by engineering a near-zero dispersion profile and using a single poling period for quasi-phase matched saturated second-harmonic generation, we achieve robust and energy efficient multi-octave QSCG with only femtojoules of pump pulse energy. In another device, we use a flat dispersion profile with two distant zero crossings of group velocity dispersion (GVD) to achieve broadband difference-frequency generation (DFG) for extending the spectral coverage further into the mid-IR and cover the entire transparency window of lithium niobate from 350 nm to 5000 nm. Our results showcase how DFG-assisted QSCG can access hard-to-access spectral regions in an energy-efficient fashion by properly utilizing dispersion engineering and quasi-phase matching.</description>

      <title>Virus Spreading in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum communication have enabled long-distance secure information transfer through quantum channels, giving rise to quantum networks with unique physical and statistical properties. However, as in classical networks, the propagation of viruses in these systems could have severe consequences. Here, we investigate the critical problem of virus spreading in quantum networks. We develop quantitative tools, particularly a modified nonlinear dynamical system model, for performing epidemiological analyses on quantum networks. Our results show that quantum networks tend to be more resilient to viral infections, exhibiting higher epidemic thresholds than classical networks with identical graph topologies. This apparent robustness, however, arises primarily from the sparser connectivity inherent to the quantum networks. When the comparison is made at a fixed average connectivity, classical and quantum networks display comparable epidemic thresholds. These findings provide key insights into the security and reliability of future large-scale quantum communication systems. Our work bridges the fields of quantum information science, network theory, and epidemiology, paving the way for future studies of quantum epidemiological dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics provides a secure means of generating random numbers, with applications in fields spanning scientific simulation to cryptography. The first source-device-independent monolithically integrated quantum random number generator is reported. With a generation rate of 35 Gbit/s, the device is based on an InP photonic integrated circuit with a quantum vacuum state entropy source, sampled by heterodyne coherent detection using an optical local oscillator. The entire device is conveniently housed in a black box and includes all the necessary driving and signal conditioning electronics, with electrical interfaces only; the exhibited security, compactness, and fast generation rate make the generator suitable for applications in QKD.</description>

      <title>Extinction Coefficients of CdSe, CdS, and CdTe Nanoplatelets in Solution: A Practical Tool for Concentration Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanoplatelets possess exceptional optical properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic applications. However, unlike quantum dots where absorption spectroscopy alone can determine both size and concentration, nanoplatelets present a significant characterization challenge: the absorption peak position reveals only thickness, providing no information about lateral dimensions or concentration. This limitation forces researchers to rely on time-consuming and costly elemental analysis techniques for complete sample characterization. Here, we present an experimentally verified theoretical framework that predicts the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient of randomly oriented CdSe, CdS, and CdTe nanoplatelets, enabling concentration determination from absorption measurements and lateral size estimates. Our model shows that the integrated absorption coefficient depends universally on nanoplatelet surface area and thickness, yielding a practical tool to extract concentrations without laborious elemental analysis. This approach bridges the characterization gap between quantum dots and nanoplatelets, offering a streamlined method for rapid sample analysis that could accelerate nanoplatelet research and applications.</description>

Abstract: The rising complexity of photonic applications, ranging from quantum computing to neuromorphic processing, has driven the demand for highly programmable and scalable photonic integrated circuits. While mesh-based architectures built from Mach-Zehnder interferometers have enabled significant advances, their reliance on beam splitting and light bending introduces optical loss, fabrication challenges, and scalability bottlenecks. Continuously lateral-coupled integrated waveguide arrays (WAs), by contrast, offer compact systems with no direct free-space analogs, but their static nature has limited their utility. Recently, programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs) have emerged as a promising alternative, combining the Hamiltonian richness of WAs with tunable control. This perspective outlines the conceptual foundations, recent progress, and future potential of PWAs across quantum simulation, photonic neural networks, topological photonics, and nonlinear optics. We examine the theoretical and practical challenges of modeling, fabrication, and control, and propose PWAs as a next-generation architecture for compact, reconfigurable photonic processors.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Configuration of Integrated Microwave Photonic Filter Featuring Self-Stabilization and Programmable Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated microwave photonic filters (IMPFs) emerge as promising candidates for advanced microwave systems owing to their distinctive combination of wide operational bandwidth, flexibility, and compact size. Nevertheless, the complex and time-consuming manual manipulation of IMPFs remains a significant impediment to their widespread applications. Here, to the best of the knowledge, the first intelligent configuration of IMPF is experimentally demonstrated, featuring wideband center frequency tunability, flexible bandwidth reconfigurability, self-stabilization, and excellent channel equalization simultaneously. The configuration is enabled by our proposed universal hybrid collaboration strategy, which fully unleashes the hardware potential of the optical device, thus enabling comprehensive synergy of multiple properties. Results show that the center frequency of IMPF is tuned from 2 to 48 GHz, covering microwave S band to Ka band, and the bandwidth is reconfigured from 0.66 to 4.15 GHz, with a rejection ratio of up to 37.67 dB. The roll-off rate and shape factor reach as high as 17.50 dB GHz-1 and 0.78, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum center frequency drift of IMPF over 3 h is reduced from 11.950 to 0.051 GHz even without a thermo-electric cooler, indicating that the center frequency stability is enhanced by 234 times. The passband shape of the IMPF is dynamically adjusted to equalize frequency-dependent fading, achieving up to 2.42 dB of intra-channel fading compensation. This work highlights the potential of IMPFs based on intelligent configuration, unlocking new avenues for practical applications of microwave photonic signal processing.</description>

      <title>Ion-Beam-Sputtered Mid-Infrared Coatings for Hybrid Supermirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the development of low-loss ion-beam-sputtered (IBS) mid-infrared coatings for hybrid supermirrors. Two highly reflective designs were realized: HR1, a 4-period a-Si/SiO$_2$ DBR with an Al$_2$O$_3$ bonding layer, and HR2, a 6-period a-Si/Ta$_2$O$_5$ DBR with an a-Si terminating layer for bonding. Combined with a GaAs/AlGaAs crystalline mirror, HR2-based hybrids yielded a total loss of 9.3 ppm and excess loss of 6.8 ppm at 4.45 $\mu$m, with cavity finesse up to 396000. For the first time, we used IBS-deposited a-Si directly as a bonding layer, verified its sub-angstrom roughness, and demonstrated excellent performance. This establishes a clear path toward scalable coatings for longer mid-infrared wavelengths, building on prior results in Nat. Commun. 14, 7846 (2023).</description>

      <title>A 2-bit Ku-band Digital Metasurface with Infinitely Scalable Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the design and implementation of a 2-bit digaital metasurface operating in the Ku-band, engineered to exhibit advanced polarization conversion characteristics and support dual-polarization control for both X- and Y-polarizations. To address the challenge of array size scalability hindered by extensive DC control routing in 2-bit metasurfaces, we propose a novel RF-DC separation architecture. This approach integrates the metasurface and DC control circuitry onto separate printed circuit boards (PCBs), interconnected via pin cascading, enabling theoretically unlimited two-dimensional array expansion. To validate this design, a ${4\times16 \times 16}$ metasurface prototype was fabricated and experimentally evaluated, which can achieve a gain of 28.3dB and an aperture efficiency of 21.02\%, confirming the scalability and performance of the proposed architecture. The developed 2-bit high-gain metasurface offers significant reference value for applications in long-distance communication and radar detection. Furthermore, the RF-DC separation architecture introduces a pioneering framework for large-scale metasurface deployment in practical engineering scenarios, enhancing design flexibility and scalability.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Layered Bimetal Nanoporous Platforms for SERS Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous metals are extensively investigated as platforms for applications in plasmonics. They present high surface areas and strong local electric fields that can be tuned at different energies, playing with the choice of the metals and the morphology of the porous layers. Until recently, research in the field of plasmonics has primarily focused on porous metals composed of a single element, with limited attention given to the impact of alloy composition. The investigation of bi-metallic systems has only just begun to emerge in the literature. In particular, combining two or more different plasmonic metals, it could be possible to explore the interactions between two metals excited at specific energies. This involves plasmonic coupling, electron transfer, band hybridization at the interface, electromagnetic field interactions, and possibly thermal and electronic energy transfer depending on separation, size, and materials involved. The analysis of bi-metal systems can also be interesting in biomolecule detection, such as in the case of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). Here we report, for the first time, a detailed study (comprising morphological analyses, numerical modelling, and optical spectroscopies) on bi-metal nanoporous platforms prepared with a dry-synthesis method enabling the easy and controllable fabrication of bilayers combining different metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu.</description>
