      <title>Realizable (reg, deg h)-Pairs for Cover Ideals via Independence Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph on $n$ vertices and set $R=\Bbbk[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, with edge ideal $I(G)$ and cover ideal $J(G)$. We give an explicit description of the $h$-polynomial of $R/J(G)$, in a form that extends to the Alexander dual of any squarefree monomial ideal. We then express $\textrm{deg } h_{R/I(G)}(t)$ and $\textrm{deg } h_{R/J(G)}(t)$ in terms of the independence polynomial $P_G(x)=\sum_{i\ge 0} g_i x^i$ via an invariant $M(G)$, the multiplicity of $x=-1$ as a root of $P_G(x)$. In particular, we prove \[\textrm{deg } h_{R/I(G)}(t)=\alpha(G)-M(G) \qquad\text{and}\qquad \textrm{deg } h_{R/J(G)}(t)=n-2-M(G), \] where $\alpha(G)$ is the independence number of $G$. As a corollary, $M(G)$ is the additive inverse of the $\mathfrak{a}$-invariants of $R/I(G)$ and $R/J(G)$. We develop recursions and closed formulas for $M(G)$ for broad graph families, and use them to analyze which (reg, deg h)-pairs occur for cover ideals within chordal classes, including explicit constructions realizing extremal behavior. We conclude with a conjectural bound on $\left|\textrm{reg }(R/J(G))-\textrm{deg } h_{R/J(G)}(t)\right|$ for connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Random chain complexes of real vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural class of models of random chain complexes of real vector spaces that some classical ensembles of random matrices, the length $1$ case. We are interested here in the homological properties of these random complexes. For chain complexes of length $1$ or $2$, we characterize the Betti numbers almost surely, in terms of the dimensions of the vector spaces. We further examine complexes of length $3$ with some constraints on dimensions, as well as complexes of arbitrary finite length in which all vector spaces have equal dimension. Across all these settings, we show that the sum of the Betti numbers is almost surely as small as possible, attaining a trivial lower bound $|\chi|$ dictated by the dimensions of the underlying vector spaces and the Euler formula. These results suggest an underlying algebraic heuristic for a phenomenon frequently observed in stochastic topology, that nontrivial homology rarely appears unless forced to.</description>

      <title>Simple generators of rational function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a subfield of the field of rational functions in several indeterminates. We present an algorithm that, given a set of generators of such a subfield, finds a simple generating set. We provide an implementation of the algorithm and show that it improves upon the state of the art both in efficiency and the quality of the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of simplified generators through several case studies from different application domains, such as structural parameter identifiability. The main algorithmic novelties include performing only partial Gr\"obner basis computation via sparse interpolation and efficient search for polynomials of a fixed degree in a subfield of the rational function field.</description>

      <title>When is the canonical conductor minimal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a one dimensional analytically unramified Cohen-Macaulay local ring $R$, the blowup algebra of the canonical ideal is a module finite birational extension. The conductor of this extension always contains the conductor of $R$. We study the case when there is equality. This is the case where $R$ is far from being almost Gorenstein. We study this property within the landscape of numerical semigroup rings and local Arf rings.</description>

      <title>Rational symbolic powers of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study rational symbolic powers of ideals in Noetherian rings. We give membership criteria for rational symbolic powers and discuss settings where they agree with integer symbolic powers. We investigate the binomial expansion formula for rational symbolic powers of mixed sums of ideals. Finally, we study rational symbolic powers of monomial ideals. In this case, we give a convex-geometric description of the rational symbolic powers. We also show that the filtration of rational symbolic powers of a monomial ideal is asymptotically stable and, as a consequence, deduce that the asymptotic regularity and asymptotic depth for this filtration exist.</description>

      <title>On homological invariants and Cohen-Macaulayness of closed neighborhood ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph and $NI(G)$ be the closed neighborhood ideal of $G$ in the polynomial ring $S=K[V(G)]$. In this paper, we study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, projective dimension and Cohen-Macaulayness of this ideal. For any chordal graph $G$, we show that $\text{reg}(S/NI(G))=\tau(G)$, where $\tau(G)$ denotes the vertex cover number of $G$. This generalizes the corresponding result for trees shown in [3], as in trees $\tau(G)$ is the same as the matching number of $G$. When $G$ is a bipartite graph or a very well-covered graph, we notice that $\text{reg}(S/NI(G))\geq \tau(G)$ and that this inequality can be strict in general. Moreover, we describe the projective dimension of $S/NI(G)$ for some families of graphs. Finally, we give a characterization of very well-covered graphs $G$ for which the ring $S/NI(G)$ is Cohen-Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the connected sum of Gorenstein algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gorenstein locus of the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb A^n$ is non-reduced for $n\geq 12$; we construct examples of non-reduced points that come from apolar algebras of the sum of general cubics. As a corollary, we get a non-reducedness result for the cactus scheme. We generalise the Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula decomposition to abstract deformation functors, providing a new method of studying deformation theory. Our construction gives us fractal structures on the nested Hilbert scheme.</description>
