      <title>Hyperfine-to-rotational energy transfer in ultracold atom-molecule collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy transfer between different mechanical degrees of freedom in atom-molecule collisions has been widely studied and largely understood. However, systems involving spins remain less explored, especially with a state-to-state precision. Here, we directly observed the energy transfer from atomic hyperfine to molecular rotation in the $^{87}$Rb ($|F_a,M_{F_a}\rangle = |2,2\rangle$) + $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb (in the rovibronic ground state $N=0$) $\longrightarrow$ Rb ($ |1,1\rangle$) + KRb ($N=0,1,2$) exothermic collision. We probed the quantum states of the collision products using resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization followed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We also carried out state-of-the-art quantum scattering calculations, which rigorously take into account the coupling between the spin and rotational degrees of freedom at short range, and assume that the KRb monomer can be treated as a rigid rotor moving on a single potential energy surface. The calculated product rotational state distribution deviates from the observations even after extensive tuning of the atom-molecule potential energy surface, suggesting that vibrational degrees of freedom and conical intersections play an important part in ultracold Rb + KRb collisions. Additionally, our ab initio calculations indicate that spin-rotation coupling is dramatically enhanced near a conical intersection, which is energetically accessible at short range. The observations confirm that spin is coupled to mechanical rotation at short range and establish a benchmark for future theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Buffer gas cooling of carbon atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate buffer gas cooling of carbon atoms to cryogenic temperatures. By employing pulsed two-photon excitation followed by vacuum ultraviolet fluorescence detection, we measured the arrival time distribution of the ablated carbon atoms to the detection volume at various helium buffer gas densities. The experimental data, corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations, reveal a rapid decrease in the local temperature of the carbon atom gas to approximately 10~K within tens of microseconds. The findings establish a major step towards novel research utilizing cold and ultracold carbon atoms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum state transfer via feedforward cancellation of optical phase noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many experimental platforms for quantum science depend on state control via laser fields. Frequently, however, the control fidelity is limited by optical phase noise. This is exacerbated in stabilized laser systems where high-frequency phase noise is an unavoidable consequence of feedback. Here we implement an optical feedforward technique to suppress laser phase noise in the STIRAP state transfer of ultracold RbCs molecules, across 114 THz, from a weakly bound Feshbach state to the rovibrational ground state. By performing over 100 state transfers on single molecules, we measure a significantly enhanced transfer efficiency of 98.7(1)% limited only by available laser intensity.</description>

      <title>Relation Between Photoionisation Cross Sections and Attosecond Time Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03697v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determination and interpretation of Wigner-like photoionisation delays is one of the most active fields of attosecond science. Previous results have suggested that large photoionisation delays are associated with structured continua, but a quantitative relation between photoionisation cross sections and time delays has been missing. Here, we derive a Kramers-Kronig-like relation between these quantities and demonstrate its validity for (anti)resonances. This new concept defines a topological analysis, which rationalises the sign of photoionisation delays and thereby sheds new light on a long-standing controversy regarding the sign of the photoionisation delay near the Ar 3s Cooper minimum. Our work bridges traditional photoionisation spectroscopy with attosecond chronoscopy and offers new methods for analysing and interpreting photoionisation delays.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of elementary excitations from quench dynamics in a dipolar XY Rydberg simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a new form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, which probes the low-energy excitations of a many-body system. We illustrate the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extract the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic couplings. We observe qualitatively different behaviors between the two cases that result from the long-range nature of the interactions, and the frustration inherent in the antiferromagnet. In particular, the ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves. In the anti-ferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.</description>

      <title>A multidimensional approach to quantum state tomography of photoelectron wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in reconstructing the density matrix of photoelectron wavepackets, in particular in complex systems where decoherence can be introduced either by a partial measurement of the system or through coupling with a stochastic environment. To this end, several methods to reconstruct the density matrix, quantum state tomography protocols, have been developed and tested on photoelectrons ejected from noble gases following absorption of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photons from attosecond pulses. It remains a challenge to obtain model-free, single scan protocols that can reconstruct the density matrix with high fidelities. Current methods require extensive measurements or involve complex fitting of the signal. Efficient single-scan reconstructions would be of great help to increase the number of systems that can be studied. We propose a new and more efficient protocol that is able to reconstruct the continuous variable density matrix of a photoelectron in a single time delay scan. It is based on measuring the coherences of a photoelectron created by absorption of an XUV pulse using a broadband infrared (IR) probe that is scanned in time and a narrowband IR reference that is temporally fixed to the XUV pulse. We illustrate its performance for a Fano resonance in He as well as mixed states in Ar arising from spin-orbit splitting. We show that the protocol results in excellent fidelities and near-perfect estimation of the purity.</description>
