      <title>Shuffle theorem for torus link homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the symmetric function $e_{(1^k)}[-MX^{m,n}] \cdot 1$, arising from the elliptic Hall algebra, equals the generating function for $k$-tuples of cyclic $(m,n)$-parking functions. This result resolves a conjecture of Gorsky--Mazin--Vazirani and Wilson, establishing that the elliptic Hall algebra governs the Khovanov--Rozansky homology of torus links $T(km,kn)$. Consequently, this provides an affirmative answer to a question of Galashin and Lam in the torus link case. As a key step in the proof, we develop a rational analogue of the Shareshian--Wachs involution originally introduced to prove the symmetry property of the chromatic quasisymmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Topology of a uniform spanning tree on a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study uniform spanning trees (USTs) on the cylindrical graph $G = C_n \times P_m$. Fix a trunk $L$ as a designated simple path in the tree connecting the two boundary rings of the cylinder. We prove an exponential tail bound for the length of branches emanating from the trunk: there exist constants $C&gt;0$ and $\theta=\theta(n)\in(0,1)$, depending only on $n$, such that for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $l\geq 0$, $$ \mathbb{P}\left(\text{UST has a branch off the trunk }L \,\text{ of length }\geq l \right) \leq Cm(n-1)\theta^{l}. $$
  Our work is motivated by the Abelian sandpile model on cylinders and, in particular, by the step-like (ladder) avalanche size distributions observed numerically in [Eckmann--Nagnibeda--Perriard, Abelian sandpiles on cylinders]. Via Dhar's burning algorithm, recurrent sandpile configurations correspond to spanning trees, so the geometry of a typical UST should influence how avalanches propagate along the cylinder. The trunk-with-short-branches structure and slash estimates proved here are intended as a first step towards a geometric explanation of these plateau phenomena for sandpile avalanches.</description>

      <title>Quickly excluding an annotated graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide proofs certifying that the structure theorem for vertex sets of bounded bidimensionality holds with polynomial bounds. The bidimensionality of vertex sets is a common generalisation of both treewidth and the face-cover-number of vertex sets in planar graphs. As such, it plays a crucial role in extensions of Courcelle's Theorem to $H$-minor-free graphs. Recently, bidimensionality and similar parameters have emerged as key for extensions of known parameterized algorithms for problems defined on a terminal set $R$. A prominent example for such a problem is Steiner Tree, which admits efficient algorithms on planar graphs whenever $R$ can be covered with few faces.
  Key to the algorithmic applications of bidimensionality is a structure theorem that explains how a graph $G$ can be decomposed into pieces where the behaviour of $R$ is highly controlled. One may see this structure theorem as a rooted analogue of Robertson and Seymour's celebrated Grid Theorem. Combining recent advances in obtaining polynomial bounds in the Graph Minors framework with new techniques for handling annotated vertex sets, we show that all parameters in the structure theorem above admit polynomial bounds. As an application, we also provide a sketch showing how our techniques imply polynomial bounds for the structure theorem for graphs excluding an apex minor.</description>

      <title>Universal 3-Edge-Weightability of Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is universally $3$-edge-weightable if for every set $\{a,b,c\}$ of three distinct real numbers, there exists an edge-weighting $w:E\to\{a,b,c\}$ such that $d_w(u)\neq d_w(v)$ for all $uv\in E$. The 1-2-3 Conjecture, recently settled by Keusch, ensures that all nice graphs admit a proper $\{1,2,3\}$-edge-weighting. For regular graphs, this implies proper edge-weightings for arithmetic progressions $\{a,b,c\}$ via affine transformation, but not for general triples due to the spacing-ratio preservation property of affine maps. We prove that every $k$-regular graph with $k\ge 2$ is universally $3$-edge-weightable. This establishes proper edge-weightings for all triples $\{a,b,c\}$, not just arithmetic progressions, showing that regular graphs satisfy a strictly stronger weighting property than what follows from the 1-2-3 Conjecture alone. The proof adapts the independent-set decomposition framework to edge-weightings and introduces a two-phase conflict-resolution scheme that operates independently of the specific choice of $\{a,b,c\}$.</description>

      <title>Almost All Vectorial Functions Have No Extended-Affine Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that asymptotically almost all vectorial functions over finite fields have trivial extended-affine stabilizers. As a consequence, the number of EA-equivalence classes is asymptotically equal to the naive estimate, namely the total number of functions divided by the size of the EA-group, with vanishing relative error. Furthermore, we derive upper bounds on collision probabilities for both extended-affine and CCZ equivalences. For EA-equivalence, we leverage the trivial-stabilizer result to establish a matching lower bound, yielding a tight asymptotic formula that shows two independently sampled functions are EA-equivalent with super-exponentially small probability. The results validate random sampling strategies for cryptographic primitive design and show that functions with nontrivial EA-symmetries form an exponentially rare subset.</description>

      <title>DP color functions versus chromatic polynomials for hypergraphs (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, the DP color function $P_{DP}(\mathcal{H},k)$ of $\mathcal{H}$ is an extension of the chromatic polynomial $P(\mathcal{H},k)$ with the property that $P_{DP}(\mathcal{H},k) \le P(\mathcal{H},k)$ for all positive integers $k$. In this article, we primarily investigate the influence of the minimum cycle length on the DP-coloring function, as well as the relevant properties of the DP-coloring function of $\mathcal{H} \vee K_p$ (i.e., the join of $\mathcal{H}$ and $K_p$). We show that for any linear and uniform hypergraph $\mathcal H$ with even girth,
  there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $P_{DP} (\mathcal H, k) &lt; P(\mathcal H, k)$ for all integers $k\ge N$, and this conclusion also holds for any hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ that contains an edge $e$ with the properties that $\mathcal{H}-e$ has exactly $|e|-1$ components and any shortest cycle in $\mathcal{H}$ containing $e$ is an even cycle. For the hypergraph $\mathcal{H}\vee K_p$, we prove that if $\mathcal{H}$ is uniform, then there exist positive integers $p$ and $N$ such that $P_{DP}(\mathcal{H} \vee K_p,k)=P(\mathcal{H} \vee K_p,k)$ holds for all integers $k\geq N$.</description>

      <title>Counting Isomorphism Classes of Spanning Trees of Complete Bipartite Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spanning trees of complete bipartite graphs exhibit a rich interaction between degree sequences and graph structure. In this paper, we obtain lower bounds on the number of isomorphism classes of spanning trees in $K_{a,b}, 2 \leq a \leq b$ in terms of $P_a(a+b-1)$ and $P_b(a+b-1)$ where $P_k(m)$ is the number of integer partitions of $m$ of length $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $\mathrm{cl}(G)$ be the number of distinct induced cycle lengths in $G$. We show that for $c,t\in \mathbb N$, every graph $G$ that does not contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_{t+1}$ or $K_{t,t}$ and satisfies $\mathrm{cl}(G) \le c$ has bounded treewidth. As a consequence, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether a graph $G$ contains induced cycles of at least three distinct lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integer convex hull $I(H_N)$ of the set $H_N=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: xy\ge N\}$ is the convex hull of the lattice points in $H_N$. The vertices of $I(H_N)$ lie in the square $[1,N]^2$. Improving on a recent result of Alc\'antara et al. ~\cite{Santos} we show that the number of vertices of $I(H_N)$ is of order $N^{1/3}\log N$. We also show that the area of the part of $H_N \setminus I(H_N)$ that lies in the square $[1,N^{2/3}]^2$ is also of order $N^{1/3}\log N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Say you and some friends decide to make brackets for March Madness and are told how each of your brackets scored. The question we ask is: when can you determine how the actual tournament went given your scores? We determine the exact minimum number of brackets needed to do this for any March Madness-style tournament regardless of the scoring system used, and more generally we prove effective bounds for the problem for arbitrary single-elimination tournaments.</description>

      <title>Constructing Koszul filtrations: existence and non-existence for G-quadratic algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a standard graded algebra over a field, we consider the relationship between G-quadraticity and the existence of a Koszul filtration. We show that having a quadratic Gr\"obner basis implies the existence of a Koszul filtration for toric algebras equipped with the degree reverse lexicographic term order and for algebras defined by binomial edge ideals. We also resolve a conjecture of Ene, Herzog, and Hibi by constructing an example where this implication fails. These results are underpinned by algorithms we develop for constructing Koszul filtrations. We also demonstrate the utility of these algorithms on the pinched Veronese algebra.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we characterize all graphs $G$ satisfying \[\operatorname{reg}(S/J_G)=\ell(G)=c(G)\] where $\ell(G)$ is the sum of the lengths of the longest induced paths in each connected component of $G$ and $c(G)$ is the number of the maximal cliques of $G$. We also characterize all connected graphs $G$ that satisfy \[\operatorname{reg}(S/J_G)=\ell(G)=|V(G)|-\omega(G)+1\] where $\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. Moreover, we investigate the possible values of the regularity of $S/J_G$ within the intervals $[\ell(G), c(G)]$ and $[\ell(G), |V(G)|-\omega(G)+1]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of partial fraction decompositions (PFDs) in several variables using tools from commutative algebra. We give criteria for when a rational function with poles on a hyperplane arrangement has a desirable PFD. Our criteria are obtained by examining the primary decomposition of ideals coming from hyperplane arrangements. We then present an algorithm for finding a PFD that satisfies properties desired by physicists, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm for computing large examples coming from Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Factors in finite groups and well-covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a combinatorial property of subsets in finite groups that is analogous to the notion of independence in graphs. Given a group $G$ and a non-empty subset $A\subset G$, we define a (right) $s$-factor as a subset $B\subset G$ satisfying the following conditions:
  (i) Every element of $AB$ can be written uniquely as $ab$ with $a\in A$ and $b\in B$.
  (ii) $B$ is maximal (with respect to inclusion) with this property.
  For a finite group $G$, the upper and lower indices of $A$ are the sizes of the largest and smallest $s$-factors associated with $A$. A subset is called stable if its upper and lower indices coincide. A group is called stable if all its subsets are stable.
  We then explore the connection between $s$-factors in groups and maximal independent sets in graphs. Specifically, we show that $s$-factors in $G$ associated with $A$ correspond to maximal independent sets in a Cayley graph Cay($G$, $S$), where $S=A^{-1}A\setminus\{e\}$. Consequently, the upper and lower indices of $A$ are equal to the independence number and the independent domination number of the associated Cayley graph.
  The concepts of $s$-factors, subset indices in groups, stable subsets, and stable groups (under different names) were introduced by Hooshmand in 2020. Later, Hooshmand and Yousefian-Arani classified stable groups using computer calculations.
  Using the connection with graphs, we compute the upper and lower indices for various groups and their subsets. Furthermore, we prove a classification theorem describing all stable groups without relying on computer calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 121 real schemes, i.e., ambient isotopy classes, of smooth real plane algebraic curves of degree seven were classified by Viro (1984). By constructing one patchwork of the dilated triangle $7\cdot\Delta_2$ for each real scheme, we provide an explicit method for constructing polynomials realizing each real scheme. In particular, every real scheme of degree seven can be realized as a T-curve; this settles a question raised by Itenberg and Viro (1996).</description>

      <title>Inverse Falconer Distance Theorems over the Integer Residue Rings $\mathbb{Z}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an ideal-theoretic rigidity principle for quadratic distance images over integer residue rings. Specifically, we prove that near-extremal collapse of the distance set in $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ forces strong algebraic structure supported on annihilator submodules arising from the arithmetic of $n$.
  As a consequence, we obtain the first inverse theorem for the Falconer distance problem over $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for composite moduli. We show that if a set $E \subset \mathbb{Z}_n^d$ of size $|E| \asymp n^{(d+1)/2}$ determines only $O(n)$ distinct squared distances, then $E$ must be supported on a coset of an annihilator submodule on which the distance form is algebraically degenerate.
  The proof introduces a divisor-depth decomposition intrinsic to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, together with a lifting mechanism that transfers local degeneracies at prime moduli into global ideal-theoretic constraints. This yields a complete classification of near-extremizers for the Falconer distance problem in the ring setting, revealing a rigidity phenomenon with no analogue over fields.</description>

      <title>On the existence of 4-regular matchstick graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.00293v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matchstick graph is a planar unit-distance graph. We call it \emph{4-regular} if every vertex has degree 4. While examples of 4-regular matchstick graphs with fewer than 63 vertices are known only for $n \in \{52, 54, 57, 60\}$, we prove the existence of such graphs for every integer $n \geq 63$.</description>

      <title>Toward Butler's conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a partition $\nu$, let $\lambda,\mu\subseteq \nu$ be two distinct partitions such that $|\nu/\lambda|=|\nu/\mu|=1$. Butler conjectured that the divided difference $\operatorname{I}_{\lambda,\mu}[X;q,t]=(T_\lambda\widetilde{H}_\mu[X;q,t]-T_\mu\widetilde{H}_\lambda[X;q,t])/(T_\lambda-T_\mu)$ of modified Macdonald polynomials of two partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ is Schur positive. By introducing a new LLT equivalence called column exchange rule, we give a combinatorial formula for $\operatorname{I}_{\lambda,\mu}[X;q,t]$, which is a positive monomial expansion. We also prove Butler's conjecture for some special cases.</description>

      <title>Characteristic quasi-polynomials of deletions of Shi arrangements of type B and their period collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characteristic quasi-polynomials are the enumerative functions counting the number of elements in the complement of hyperplane arrangements modulo positive integers. A notable phenomenon in this context is period collapse, where the quasi-polynomial reduces to a polynomial or has a smaller period than the lcm period. In this paper, we compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials of the restriction of the Shi arrangement of type B by one given hyperplane. As a corollary, we completely determine whether period collapse occurs in the characteristic quasi-polynomial of the deletion of the Shi arrangement of type B. This implies the solution for the conjecture posed by Higashitani, Tran and Yoshinaga in this case.</description>

      <title>Exactly-solvable self-trapping lattice walks. II. Lattices of arbitrary height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing self-avoiding walk (GSAW) is a walk on a graph that is directed, does not visit the same vertex twice, and has a trapped endpoint. We show that the generating function enumerating GSAWs on a half-infinite strip of finite height is rational, and we give a procedure to construct a combinatorial finite state machine that allows one to compute this generating function. We then modify this procedure to compute generating functions for GSAWs under two probabilistic models. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected length and displacement for GSAWs on the quarter plane, half plane, full plane, and half-infinite strips of bounded height for which we cannot compute the generating function. Finally, we prove that the generating functions for Greek key tours (GSAWs on a finite grid that visit every vertex) on a half-infinite strip of fixed height are also rational, allowing us to resolve several conjectures.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous substructures in random ordered hyper-matchings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ordered $r$-uniform matching of size $n$ is a collection of $n$ pairwise disjoint $r$-subsets of a linearly ordered set of $rn$ vertices. For $n=2$, such a matching is called an $r$-pattern, as it represents one of $\tfrac12\binom{2r}r$ ways two disjoint edges may intertwine. Given a set $\mathcal{P}$ of $r$-patterns, a $\mathcal{P}$-clique is a matching with all pairs of edges order-isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{P}$.
  In this paper we are interested in the size of a largest $\mathcal{P}$-clique in a random ordered $r$-uniform matching selected uniformly from all such matchings on a fixed vertex set $[rn]$. We determine this size (up to multiplicative constants) for several sets $\mathcal{P}$, including all sets of size $|\mathcal{P}|\le2$, the set $\mathcal{R}^{(r)}$ of all $r$-partite patterns, as well as sets $\mathcal{P}$ enjoying a Boolean-like, symmetric structure.</description>

      <title>Packing subdivisions into regular graphs</title>

Abstract: We show that, for any graph $F$ and $\eta&gt;0$, there exists a $d_0=d_0(F,\eta)$ such that every $n$-vertex $d$-regular graph with $d \geq d_0$ has a collection of vertex-disjoint $F$-subdivisions covering at least $(1-\eta)n$ vertices. This verifies a conjecture of Verstra\"ete from 2002 and improves a recent result of Letzter, Methuku and Sudakov which additionally required $d$ to be at least polylogarithmic in $n$.</description>

      <title>Zero-free regions for the independence polynomial on restricted graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalising the Heilman-Lieb Theorem from statistical physics, Chudnovsky and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 97(3):350--357] showed that the univariate independence polynomial of any claw-free graph has all of its zeros on the negative real line. In this paper, we show that for any fixed subdivded claw $H$ and any $\Delta$, there is an open set $F \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ containing $[0, \infty)$ such that the independence polynomial of any $H$-free graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ has all of its zeros outside of $F$. We also show that no such result can hold when $H$ is any graph other than a subdivided claw or if we drop the maximum degree condition.
  We also establish zero-free regions for the multivariate independence polynomial of $H$-free graphs of bounded degree when $H$ is a subdivided claw. The statements of these results are more subtle, but are again best possible in various senses.</description>

      <title>New upper bounds for the period of a negative orientable sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative orientable sequences, i.e. periodic sequences with elements from a finite alphabet of size at least three in which an n-tuple or the negative of its reverse appears at most once in a period of the sequence, were introduced by Alhakim et al. in 2024. The main goal in defining them was as a means of generating orientable sequences, which have automatic position location applications, although they are potentially of interest in their own right. In this paper we develop new upper bounds on the period of negative orientable sequences which, for n&gt;2, are significantly sharper than the previous known bound. The approach used to develop the new bounds involves examining the nodes in the subgraph of the de Bruijn graph corresponding to a negative orientable sequence, and to consider the implications of the fact that the in-degree of every vertex in this subgraph must equal the out-degree. However, despite improving the bounds, a gap remains between the largest known period for a negative orientable sequence and the corresponding bounds for every n&gt;2.</description>

      <title>Dead ends in square-free digit walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study "dead ends" in square-free digit walks: square-free integers $N$ such that, in base $b$, every one-digit extension $bN+d$ is non-square-free. In base $10$, the stochastic independence model of Miller et al. suggests that infinite square-free walks occur with probability near $1$, corresponding to an asymptotic dead-end density of $\approx 5.218\times 10^{-5}$. We prove that the true asymptotic dead-end density satisfies \[ c_{\mathrm{dead}} \approx 1.317\times 10^{-9}, \] roughly a factor of $\sim 4\times 10^4$ smaller than the prediction. For every base $b\geq 2$, we prove that dead-end densities exist and are given by a closed-form expression (as a finite alternating sum of Euler products). The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the problem.</description>

      <title>Counting point configurations in projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the enumerative geometry of point configurations in projective space. We define "projective configuration counts": these enumerate configurations of points in projective space such that certain specified subsets are in fixed relative positions. The $\mathbb{P}^1$ case recovers cross-ratio degrees, which arise naturally in numerous contexts. We establish two main results. The first is a combinatorial upper bound given by the number of weighted transversals of a bipartite graph. The second is a recursion that relates counts associated to projective spaces of different dimensions, by projecting away from a given point. Key inputs include the Gelfand-MacPherson correspondence, the Jacobi-Trudi and Thom-Porteous formulae, and the notion of surplus from matching theory of bipartite graphs.</description>
