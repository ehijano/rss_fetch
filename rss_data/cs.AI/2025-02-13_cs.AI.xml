      <title>Reasoning-as-Logic-Units: Scaling Test-Time Reasoning in Large Language Models Through Logic Unit Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by generating natural language (NL) rationales that lead to the final answer. However, it struggles with numerical computation, which has somehow led to the development of program-aided techniques. Despite their potential, a persistent challenge remains: inconsistencies between LLM-reported reasoning steps and the logic in generated programs, which we term ``reasoning hallucinations." This stems from the inherent ambiguities of NL and the statistical nature of LLMs, which often lack rigorous logical coherence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel test-time scaling framework, Reasoning-as-Logic-Units (RaLU), which constructs a more reliable reasoning path by aligning logical units between the generated program and their corresponding NL descriptions. By decomposing the initially generated program into discrete units using static analysis, RaLU engages in an iterative dialogue with the LLM to judge, refine, and explain each unit. A rewind-and-correct mechanism ensures alignment between code statements and task requirements in each unit, ultimately forming a cohesive reasoning path under the program's logic, from which the model reaches a final solution. Our experiments demonstrate that RaLU significantly outperforms existing baselines in mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH) and algorithmic reasoning (HumanEval+, MBPP+), underscoring its potential to advance LLM reasoning and programming by offering enhanced accuracy and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Temporal Model On Quantum Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical framework for modeling temporal memory dynamics, combining concepts from temporal logic, memory decay models, and hierarchical contexts. The framework formalizes the evolution of propositions over time using linear and branching temporal models, incorporating exponential decay (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve) and reactivation mechanisms via Bayesian updating. The hierarchical organization of memory is represented using directed acyclic graphs to model recall dependencies and interference. Novel insights include feedback dynamics, recursive influences in memory chains, and the integration of entropy-based recall efficiency. This approach provides a foundation for understanding memory processes across cognitive and computational domains.</description>

      <title>Enhancing kidney transplantation through multi-agent kidney exchange programs: A comprehensive review and optimization models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of the last two decades of research on Kidney Exchange Programs (KEPs), systematically categorizing and classifying key contributions to provide readers with a structured understanding of advancements in the field. The review highlights the evolution of KEP methodologies and lays the foundation for our contribution. We propose three mathematical models aimed at improving both the quantity and quality of kidney transplants. Model 1 maximizes the number of transplants by focusing on compatibility based on blood type and PRA, without additional constraints. Model 2 introduces a minimum Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) compatibility threshold to enhance transplant quality, though this leads to fewer matches. Model 3 extends the problem to a Multi-Agent Kidney Exchange Program (MKEP), pooling incompatible donor-recipient pairs across multiple agents, resulting in a higher number of successful transplants while ensuring fairness across agents. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate trade-offs between transplant quantity and quality, with Model 3 striking the optimal balance by leveraging multi-agent collaboration to improve both the number and quality of transplants. These findings underscore the potential benefits of more integrated kidney exchange systems.</description>

      <title>SHACL-SKOS Based Knowledge Representation of Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the Pharmaceutical Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of a knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) system built on hybrid SHACL-SKOS ontologies for globally harmonized system (GHS) material Safety Data Sheets (SDS) to enhance chemical safety communication and regulatory compliance. SDS are comprehensive documents containing safety and handling information for chemical substances. Thus, they are an essential part of workplace safety and risk management. However, the vast number of Safety Data Sheets from multiple organizations, manufacturers, and suppliers that produce and distribute chemicals makes it challenging to centralize and access SDS documents through a single repository. To accomplish the underlying issues of data exchange related to chemical shipping and handling, we construct SDS related controlled vocabulary and conditions validated by SHACL, and knowledge systems of similar domains linked via SKOS. The resulting hybrid ontologies aim to provide standardized yet adaptable representations of SDS information, facilitating better data sharing, retrieval, and integration across various platforms. This paper outlines our SHACL-SKOS system architectural design and showcases our implementation for an industrial application streamlining the generation of a composite shipping cover sheet.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Bias is Predicted by Pretraining Data and Correlates with Downstream Performance in Vision-Language Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent work has found that vision-language models trained under the Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework contain intrinsic social biases, the extent to which different upstream pre-training features of the framework relate to these biases, and hence how intrinsic bias and downstream performance are connected has been unclear. In this work, we present the largest comprehensive analysis to-date of how the upstream pre-training factors and downstream performance of CLIP models relate to their intrinsic biases. Studying 131 unique CLIP models, trained on 26 datasets, using 55 architectures, and in a variety of sizes, we evaluate bias in each model using 26 well-established unimodal and cross-modal principled Embedding Association Tests. We find that the choice of pre-training dataset is the most significant upstream predictor of bias, whereas architectural variations have minimal impact. Additionally, datasets curated using sophisticated filtering techniques aimed at enhancing downstream model performance tend to be associated with higher levels of intrinsic bias. Finally, we observe that intrinsic bias is often significantly correlated with downstream performance ($0.3 \leq r \leq 0.8$), suggesting that models optimized for performance inadvertently learn to amplify representational biases. Comparisons between unimodal and cross-modal association tests reveal that social group bias depends heavily on the modality. Our findings imply that more sophisticated strategies are needed to address intrinsic model bias for vision-language models across the entire model development pipeline.</description>

      <title>Deep Semantic Graph Learning via LLM based Node Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph learning has attracted significant attention due to its widespread real-world applications. Current mainstream approaches rely on text node features and obtain initial node embeddings through shallow embedding learning using GNNs, which shows limitations in capturing deep textual semantics. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior capabilities in understanding text semantics, transforming traditional text feature processing. This paper proposes a novel framework that combines Graph Transformer architecture with LLM-enhanced node features. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to generate rich semantic representations of text nodes, which are then processed by a multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Graph Transformer to capture both local and global graph structural information. Our model utilizes the Transformer's attention mechanism to dynamically aggregate neighborhood information while preserving the semantic richness provided by LLM embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-enhanced node features significantly improve the performance of graph learning models on node classification tasks. This approach shows promising results across multiple graph learning tasks, offering a practical direction for combining graph networks with language models.</description>

      <title>Universal Adversarial Attack on Aligned Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07987v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g., ''Sure, here it is'') or otherwise unsafe content-even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench benchmark, our method achieves significantly higher attack success rates than existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 93% on certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model transferability by training on several multimodal LLMs simultaneously and testing on unseen architectures. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses. These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license. Warning: some content generated by Multimodal LLMs in this paper may be offensive to some readers.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Safe Denoisers for Safe Use of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08011v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing concern over the safety of powerful diffusion models (DMs), as they are often misused to produce inappropriate, not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content or generate copyrighted material or data of individuals who wish to be forgotten. Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.</description>

      <title>WorldGUI: Dynamic Testing for Comprehensive Desktop GUI Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current GUI agents have achieved outstanding performance in GUI element grounding. However, planning remains highly challenging, especially due to sensitivity to the initial state of the environment. Specifically, slight differences in the initial state-such as the target software not being open or the interface not being in its default state-often lead to planning errors. This issue is widespread in real user scenarios, but existing benchmarks fail to evaluate it. In this paper, we present WorldGUI, a novel GUI benchmark that designs GUI tasks with various initial states to simulate real computer-user interactions. The benchmark spans a wide range of tasks across 10 popular software applications, including PowerPoint, VSCode, and Adobe Acrobat. In addition, to address the challenges of dynamic GUI automation tasks, we propose GUI-Thinker, a holistic framework, leveraging a critique mechanism, that effectively manages the unpredictability and complexity of GUI interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that GUI-Thinker significantly outperforms Claude-3.5 (Computer Use) by 14.9% in success rate on WorldGUI tasks. This improvement underscores the effectiveness of our critical-thinking-based framework in enhancing GUI automation.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Enhanced Cooperative MEC of UAVs and Ground Stations for Unmanned Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) require computational support and coverage in applications such as maritime search and rescue. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can offer low-cost, flexible aerial services, and ground stations (GSs) can provide powerful supports, which can cooperate to help the USVs in complex scenarios. However, the collaboration between UAVs and GSs for USVs faces challenges of task uncertainties, USVs trajectory uncertainties, heterogeneities, and limited computational resources. To address these issues, we propose a cooperative UAV and GS based robust multi-access edge computing framework to assist USVs in completing computational tasks. Specifically, we formulate the optimization problem of joint task offloading and UAV trajectory to minimize the total execution time, which is in the form of mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to tackle. Therefore, we propose the algorithm of generative artificial intelligence-enhanced heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization (GAI-HAPPO). The proposed algorithm integrates GAI models to enhance the actor network ability to model complex environments and extract high-level features, thereby allowing the algorithm to predict uncertainties and adapt to dynamic conditions. Additionally, GAI stabilizes the critic network, addressing the instability of multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing benchmark methods, thus highlighting the potentials in tackling intricate, cross-domain issues in the considered scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Safety Gap: A Guardrail Pipeline for Trustworthy LLM Inferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Wildflare GuardRail, a guardrail pipeline designed to enhance the safety and reliability of Large Language Model (LLM) inferences by systematically addressing risks across the entire processing workflow. Wildflare GuardRail integrates several core functional modules, including Safety Detector that identifies unsafe inputs and detects hallucinations in model outputs while generating root-cause explanations, Grounding that contextualizes user queries with information retrieved from vector databases, Customizer that adjusts outputs in real time using lightweight, rule-based wrappers, and Repairer that corrects erroneous LLM outputs using hallucination explanations provided by Safety Detector. Results show that our unsafe content detection model in Safety Detector achieves comparable performance with OpenAI API, though trained on a small dataset constructed with several public datasets. Meanwhile, the lightweight wrappers can address malicious URLs in model outputs in 1.06s per query with 100% accuracy without costly model calls. Moreover, the hallucination fixing model demonstrates effectiveness in reducing hallucinations with an accuracy of 80.7%.</description>

      <title>ACCESS : A Benchmark for Abstract Causal Event Discovery and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying cause-and-effect relationships is critical to understanding real-world dynamics and ultimately causal reasoning. Existing methods for identifying event causality in NLP, including those based on Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibit difficulties in out-of-distribution settings due to the limited scale and heavy reliance on lexical cues within available benchmarks. Modern benchmarks, inspired by probabilistic causal inference, have attempted to construct causal graphs of events as a robust representation of causal knowledge, where \texttt{CRAB} \citep{romanou2023crab} is one such recent benchmark along this line. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{ACCESS}, a benchmark designed for discovery and reasoning over abstract causal events. Unlike existing resources, \texttt{ACCESS} focuses on causality of everyday life events on the abstraction level. We propose a pipeline for identifying abstractions for event generalizations from \texttt{GLUCOSE} \citep{mostafazadeh-etal-2020-glucose}, a large-scale dataset of implicit commonsense causal knowledge, from which we subsequently extract $1,4$K causal pairs. Our experiments highlight the ongoing challenges of using statistical methods and/or LLMs for automatic abstraction identification and causal discovery in NLP. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the abstract causal knowledge provided in \texttt{ACCESS} can be leveraged for enhancing QA reasoning performance in LLMs.</description>

      <title>SycEval: Evaluating LLM Sycophancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in educational, clinical, and professional settings, but their tendency for sycophancy -- prioritizing user agreement over independent reasoning -- poses risks to reliability. This study introduces a framework to evaluate sycophantic behavior in ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro across AMPS (mathematics) and MedQuad (medical advice) datasets. Sycophantic behavior was observed in 58.19% of cases, with Gemini exhibiting the highest rate (62.47%) and ChatGPT the lowest (56.71%). Progressive sycophancy, leading to correct answers, occurred in 43.52% of cases, while regressive sycophancy, leading to incorrect answers, was observed in 14.66%. Preemptive rebuttals demonstrated significantly higher sycophancy rates than in-context rebuttals (61.75% vs. 56.52%, $Z=5.87$, $p&lt;0.001$), particularly in computational tasks, where regressive sycophancy increased significantly (preemptive: 8.13%, in-context: 3.54%, $p&lt;0.001$). Simple rebuttals maximized progressive sycophancy ($Z=6.59$, $p&lt;0.001$), while citation-based rebuttals exhibited the highest regressive rates ($Z=6.59$, $p&lt;0.001$). Sycophantic behavior showed high persistence (78.5%, 95% CI: [77.2%, 79.8%]) regardless of context or model. These findings emphasize the risks and opportunities of deploying LLMs in structured and dynamic domains, offering insights into prompt programming and model optimization for safer AI applications.</description>

      <title>The Danger of Overthinking: Examining the Reasoning-Action Dilemma in Agentic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) represent a breakthrough in AI problem-solving capabilities, but their effectiveness in interactive environments can be limited. This paper introduces and analyzes overthinking in LRMs. A phenomenon where models favor extended internal reasoning chains over environmental interaction. Through experiments on software engineering tasks using SWE Bench Verified, we observe three recurring patterns: Analysis Paralysis, Rogue Actions, and Premature Disengagement. We propose a framework to study these behaviors, which correlates with human expert assessments, and analyze 4018 trajectories. We observe that higher overthinking scores correlate with decreased performance, with reasoning models exhibiting stronger tendencies toward overthinking compared to non-reasoning models. Our analysis reveals that simple efforts to mitigate overthinking in agentic environments, such as selecting the solution with the lower overthinking score, can improve model performance by almost 30% while reducing computational costs by 43%. These results suggest that mitigating overthinking has strong practical implications. We suggest that by leveraging native function-calling capabilities and selective reinforcement learning overthinking tendencies could be mitigated. We also open-source our evaluation framework and dataset to facilitate research in this direction at https://github.com/AlexCuadron/Overthinking.</description>

      <title>Improving Existing Optimization Algorithms with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into optimization has created a powerful synergy, opening exciting research opportunities. This paper investigates how LLMs can enhance existing optimization algorithms. Using their pre-trained knowledge, we demonstrate their ability to propose innovative heuristic variations and implementation strategies. To evaluate this, we applied a non-trivial optimization algorithm, Construct, Merge, Solve and Adapt (CMSA) -- a hybrid metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization problems that incorporates a heuristic in the solution construction phase. Our results show that an alternative heuristic proposed by GPT-4o outperforms the expert-designed heuristic of CMSA, with the performance gap widening on larger and denser graphs.

      <title>Salience-Invariant Consistent Policy Learning for Generalization in Visual Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing policies to unseen scenarios remains a critical challenge in visual reinforcement learning, where agents often overfit to the specific visual observations of the training environment. In unseen environments, distracting pixels may lead agents to extract representations containing task-irrelevant information. As a result, agents may deviate from the optimal behaviors learned during training, thereby hindering visual generalization.To address this issue, we propose the Salience-Invariant Consistent Policy Learning (SCPL) algorithm, an efficient framework for zero-shot generalization. Our approach introduces a novel value consistency module alongside a dynamics module to effectively capture task-relevant representations. The value consistency module, guided by saliency, ensures the agent focuses on task-relevant pixels in both original and perturbed observations, while the dynamics module uses augmented data to help the encoder capture dynamic- and reward-relevant representations. Additionally, our theoretical analysis highlights the importance of policy consistency for generalization. To strengthen this, we introduce a policy consistency module with a KL divergence constraint to maintain consistent policies across original and perturbed observations.Extensive experiments on the DMC-GB, Robotic Manipulation, and CARLA benchmarks demonstrate that SCPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization. Notably, SCPL achieves average performance improvements of 14\%, 39\%, and 69\% in the challenging DMC video hard setting, the Robotic hard setting, and the CARLA benchmark, respectively.Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/scpl-rl.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we identify the "2D-Cheating" problem in 3D LLM evaluation, where these tasks might be easily solved by VLMs with rendered images of point clouds, exposing ineffective evaluation of 3D LLMs' unique 3D capabilities. We test VLM performance across multiple 3D LLM benchmarks and, using this as a reference, propose principles for better assessing genuine 3D understanding. We also advocate explicitly separating 3D abilities from 1D or 2D aspects when evaluating 3D LLMs.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning to Advance Multi-institutional Studies with Electronic Health Record Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of EHRs has expanded opportunities to leverage data-driven algorithms in clinical care and research. A major bottleneck in effectively conducting multi-institutional EHR studies is the data heterogeneity across systems with numerous codes that either do not exist or represent different clinical concepts across institutions. The need for data privacy further limits the feasibility of including multi-institutional patient-level data required to study similarities and differences across patient subgroups. To address these challenges, we developed the GAME algorithm. Tested and validated across 7 institutions and 2 languages, GAME integrates data in several levels: (1) at the institutional level with knowledge graphs to establish relationships between codes and existing knowledge sources, providing the medical context for standard codes and their relationship to each other; (2) between institutions, leveraging language models to determine the relationships between institution-specific codes with established standard codes; and (3) quantifying the strength of the relationships between codes using a graph attention network. Jointly trained embeddings are created using transfer and federated learning to preserve data privacy. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of GAME in selecting relevant features as inputs for AI-driven algorithms in a range of conditions, e.g., heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis. We then highlight the application of GAME harmonized multi-institutional EHR data in a study of Alzheimer's disease outcomes and suicide risk among patients with mental health disorders, without sharing patient-level data outside individual institutions.</description>

      <title>Ensemble based approach to quantifying uncertainty of LLM based classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The output of Large Language Models (LLMs) are a function of the internal model's parameters and the input provided into the context window. The hypothesis presented here is that under a greedy sampling strategy the variance in the LLM's output is a function of the conceptual certainty embedded in the model's parametric knowledge, as well as the lexical variance in the input. Finetuning the model results in reducing the sensitivity of the model output to the lexical input variations. This is then applied to a classification problem and a probabilistic method is proposed for estimating the certainties of the predicted classes.</description>

Abstract: The advent of quantum computing has opened new possibilities in data science, offering unique capabilities for addressing complex, data-intensive problems. Traditional machine learning algorithms often face challenges in high-dimensional or limited-quality datasets, which are common in healthcare. Quantum Machine Learning leverages quantum properties, such as superposition and entanglement, to enhance pattern recognition and classification, potentially surpassing classical approaches. This paper explores QML's application in healthcare, focusing on quantum kernel methods and hybrid quantum-classical networks for heart disease prediction and COVID-19 detection, assessing their feasibility and performance.</description>

      <title>Counterexample Guided Program Repair Using Zero-Shot Learning and MaxSAT-based Fault Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) for introductory programming assignments (IPAs) is motivated by the large number of student enrollments in programming courses each year. Since providing feedback on IPAs requires substantial time and effort from faculty, personalized feedback often involves suggesting fixes to students' programs. Formal Methods (FM)-based semantic repair approaches, check a program's execution against a test suite or reference solution, are effective but limited. These tools excel at identifying buggy parts but can only fix programs if the correct implementation and the faulty one share the same control flow graph. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for APR but often make extensive instead of minimal rewrites. This leads to more invasive fixes, making it harder for students to learn from their mistakes. In summary, LLMs excel at completing strings, while FM-based fault localization excel at identifying buggy parts of a program. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both FM-based fault localization and LLMs, via zero-shot learning, to enhance APR for IPAs. Our method uses MaxSAT-based fault localization to identify buggy parts of a program, then presents the LLM with a program sketch devoid of these buggy statements. This hybrid approach follows a CEGIS loop to iteratively refine the program. We ask the LLM to synthesize the missing parts, which are then checked against a test suite. If the suggested program is incorrect, a counterexample from the test suite is fed back to the LLM. Our experiments show that our counterexample guided approach, using MaxSAT-based bug-free program sketches, significantly improves the repair capabilities of all six evaluated LLMs. This method allows LLMs to repair more programs with smaller fixes, outperforming other configurations and state-of-the-art symbolic program repair tools.</description>

      <title>Do AI assistants help students write formal specifications? A study with ChatGPT and the B-Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of AI assistants, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT, in teaching formal methods (FM) to undergraduate students, using the B-method as a formal specification technique. While existing studies demonstrate the effectiveness of AI in coding tasks, no study reports on its impact on formal specifications. We examine whether ChatGPT provides an advantage when writing B-specifications and analyse student trust in its outputs. Our findings indicate that the AI does not help students to enhance the correctness of their specifications, with low trust correlating to better outcomes. Additionally, we identify a behavioural pattern with which to interact with ChatGPT which may influence the correctness of B-specifications.</description>

      <title>Can Generative AI be Egalitarian?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent explosion of "foundation" generative AI models has been built upon the extensive extraction of value from online sources, often without corresponding reciprocation. This pattern mirrors and intensifies the extractive practices of surveillance capitalism, while the potential for enormous profit has challenged technology organizations' commitments to responsible AI practices, raising significant ethical and societal concerns. However, a promising alternative is emerging: the development of models that rely on content willingly and collaboratively provided by users. This article explores this "egalitarian" approach to generative AI, taking inspiration from the successful model of Wikipedia. We explore the potential implications of this approach for the design, development, and constraints of future foundation models. We argue that such an approach is not only ethically sound but may also lead to models that are more responsive to user needs, more diverse in their training data, and ultimately more aligned with societal values. Furthermore, we explore potential challenges and limitations of this approach, including issues of scalability, quality control, and potential biases inherent in volunteer-contributed content.</description>

      <title>Regulatory Science Innovation for Generative AI and Large Language Models in Health and Medicine: A Global Call for Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) in healthcare presents both unprecedented opportunities and challenges, necessitating innovative regulatory approaches. GenAI and LLMs offer broad applications, from automating clinical workflows to personalizing diagnostics. However, the non-deterministic outputs, broad functionalities and complex integration of GenAI and LLMs challenge existing medical device regulatory frameworks, including the total product life cycle (TPLC) approach. Here we discuss the constraints of the TPLC approach to GenAI and LLM-based medical device regulation, and advocate for global collaboration in regulatory science research. This serves as the foundation for developing innovative approaches including adaptive policies and regulatory sandboxes, to test and refine governance in real-world settings. International harmonization, as seen with the International Medical Device Regulators Forum, is essential to manage implications of LLM on global health, including risks of widening health inequities driven by inherent model biases. By engaging multidisciplinary expertise, prioritizing iterative, data-driven approaches, and focusing on the needs of diverse populations, global regulatory science research enables the responsible and equitable advancement of LLM innovations in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Quantum Powered Credit Risk Assessment: A Novel Approach using hybrid Quantum-Classical Deep Neural Network for Row-Type Dependent Predictive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) techniques into the landscape of financial risk analysis presents a promising avenue for innovation. This study introduces a framework for credit risk assessment in the banking sector, combining quantum deep learning techniques with adaptive modeling for Row-Type Dependent Predictive Analysis (RTDPA). By leveraging RTDPA, the proposed approach tailors predictive models to different loan categories, aiming to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of credit risk evaluation. While this work explores the potential of integrating quantum methods with classical deep learning for risk assessment, it focuses on the feasibility and performance of this hybrid framework rather than claiming transformative industry-wide impacts. The findings offer insights into how quantum techniques can complement traditional financial analysis, paving the way for further advancements in predictive modeling for credit risk.</description>

      <title>CP-Guard+: A New Paradigm for Malicious Agent Detection and Defense in Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) is a promising method for safe connected and autonomous driving, which enables multiple vehicles to share sensing information to enhance perception performance. However, compared with single-vehicle perception, the openness of a CP system makes it more vulnerable to malicious attacks that can inject malicious information to mislead the perception of an ego vehicle, resulting in severe risks for safe driving. To mitigate such vulnerability, we first propose a new paradigm for malicious agent detection that effectively identifies malicious agents at the feature level without requiring verification of final perception results, significantly reducing computational overhead. Building on this paradigm, we introduce CP-GuardBench, the first comprehensive dataset provided to train and evaluate various malicious agent detection methods for CP systems. Furthermore, we develop a robust defense method called CP-Guard+, which enhances the margin between the representations of benign and malicious features through a carefully designed Dual-Centered Contrastive Loss (DCCLoss). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both CP-GuardBench and V2X-Sim, and demonstrate the superiority of CP-Guard+.</description>

      <title>CryptoX : Compositional Reasoning Evaluation of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compositional reasoning capacity has long been regarded as critical to the generalization and intelligence emergence of large language models LLMs. However, despite numerous reasoning-related benchmarks, the compositional reasoning capacity of LLMs is rarely studied or quantified in the existing benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce CryptoX, an evaluation framework that, for the first time, combines existing benchmarks and cryptographic, to quantify the compositional reasoning capacity of LLMs. Building upon CryptoX, we construct CryptoBench, which integrates these principles into several benchmarks for systematic evaluation. We conduct detailed experiments on widely used open-source and closed-source LLMs using CryptoBench, revealing a huge gap between open-source and closed-source LLMs. We further conduct thorough mechanical interpretability experiments to reveal the inner mechanism of LLMs' compositional reasoning, involving subproblem decomposition, subproblem inference, and summarizing subproblem conclusions. Through analysis based on CryptoBench, we highlight the value of independently studying compositional reasoning and emphasize the need to enhance the compositional reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Satellite Observations Guided Diffusion Model for Accurate Meteorological States at Arbitrary Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate acquisition of surface meteorological conditions at arbitrary locations holds significant importance for weather forecasting and climate simulation. Due to the fact that meteorological states derived from satellite observations are often provided in the form of low-resolution grid fields, the direct application of spatial interpolation to obtain meteorological states for specific locations often results in significant discrepancies when compared to actual observations. Existing downscaling methods for acquiring meteorological state information at higher resolutions commonly overlook the correlation with satellite observations. To bridge the gap, we propose Satellite-observations Guided Diffusion Model (SGD), a conditional diffusion model pre-trained on ERA5 reanalysis data with satellite observations (GridSat) as conditions, which is employed for sampling downscaled meteorological states through a zero-shot guided sampling strategy and patch-based methods. During the training process, we propose to fuse the information from GridSat satellite observations into ERA5 maps via the attention mechanism, enabling SGD to generate atmospheric states that align more accurately with actual conditions. In the sampling, we employed optimizable convolutional kernels to simulate the upscale process, thereby generating high-resolution ERA5 maps using low-resolution ERA5 maps as well as observations from weather stations as guidance. Moreover, our devised patch-based method promotes SGD to generate meteorological states at arbitrary resolutions. Experiments demonstrate SGD fulfills accurate meteorological states downscaling to 6.25km.</description>

      <title>Decoding Complexity: Intelligent Pattern Exploration with CHPDA (Context Aware Hybrid Pattern Detection Algorithm)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) is critical for data security platforms. This study evaluates regex-based pattern matching algorithms and exact-match search techniques to optimize detection speed, accuracy, and scalability. Our benchmarking results indicate that Google RE2 provides the best balance of speed (10-15 ms/MB), memory efficiency (8-16 MB), and accuracy (99.5%) among regex engines, outperforming PCRE while maintaining broader hardware compatibility than Hyperscan. For exact matching, Aho-Corasick demonstrated superior performance (8 ms/MB) and scalability for large datasets. Performance analysis revealed that regex processing time scales linearly with dataset size and pattern complexity. A hybrid AI + Regex approach achieved the highest F1 score (91. 6%) by improving recall and minimizing false positives. Device benchmarking confirmed that our solution maintains efficient CPU and memory usage on both high-performance and mid-range systems. Despite its effectiveness, challenges remain, such as limited multilingual support and the need for regular pattern updates. Future work should focus on expanding language coverage, integrating data security and privacy management (DSPM) with data loss prevention (DLP) tools, and enhancing regulatory compliance for broader global adoption.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Compression for IMC Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of low-rank model compression in the context of in-memory computing (IMC) architectures. Traditional pruning approaches, while effective in model size reduction, necessitate additional peripheral circuitry to manage complex dataflows and mitigate dislocation issues, leading to increased area and energy overheads. To circumvent these drawbacks, we propose leveraging low-rank compression techniques, which, unlike pruning, streamline the dataflow and seamlessly integrate with IMC architectures. However, low-rank compression presents its own set of challenges, namely i) suboptimal IMC array utilization and ii) compromised accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach i) employing shift and duplicate kernel (SDK) mapping technique, which exploits idle IMC columns for parallel processing, and ii) group low-rank convolution, which mitigates the information imbalance in the decomposed matrices. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves up to 2.5x speedup or +20.9% accuracy boost over existing pruning techniques.</description>

      <title>Amnesia as a Catalyst for Enhancing Black Box Pixel Attacks in Image Classification and Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that query-based attacks tend to have relatively higher success rates in adversarial black-box attacks. While research on black-box attacks is actively being conducted, relatively few studies have focused on pixel attacks that target only a limited number of pixels. In image classification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily depend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more suitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, query-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box attack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement Learning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget processes. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging rewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR effectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while adhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed attack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the confidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed state-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the MSCOCO dataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAP reduction to state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query. Further experiments on the Argoverse dataset using YOLOv8 confirm that RFPAR effectively removed objects on a larger scale dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/KAU-QuantumAILab/RFPAR.</description>

      <title>PDM-SSD: Single-Stage Three-Dimensional Object Detector With Point Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Point-based detectors can only learn from the provided points, with limited receptive fields and insufficient global learning capabilities for such targets. In this paper, we present a novel Point Dilation Mechanism for single-stage 3D detection (PDM-SSD) that takes advantage of these two representations. Specifically, we first use a PointNet-style 3D backbone for efficient feature encoding. Then, a neck with Point Dilation Mechanism (PDM) is used to expand the feature space, which involves two key steps: point dilation and feature filling. The former expands points to a certain size grid centered around the sampled points in Euclidean space. The latter fills the unoccupied grid with feature for backpropagation using spherical harmonic coefficients and Gaussian density function in terms of direction and scale. Next, we associate multiple dilation centers and fuse coefficients to obtain sparse grid features through height compression. Finally, we design a hybrid detection head for joint learning, where on one hand, the scene heatmap is predicted to complement the voting point set for improved detection accuracy, and on the other hand, the target probability of detected boxes are calibrated through feature fusion. On the challenging Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) dataset, PDM-SSD achieves state-of-the-art results for multi-class detection among single-modal methods with an inference speed of 68 frames. We also demonstrate the advantages of PDM-SSD in detecting sparse and incomplete objects through numerous object-level instances. Additionally, PDM can serve as an auxiliary network to establish a connection between sampling points and object centers, thereby improving the accuracy of the model without sacrificing inference speed. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AlanLiangC/PDM-SSD.git.</description>

      <title>Runtime Tunable Tsetlin Machines for Edge Inference on eFPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (eFPGAs) allow for the design of hardware accelerators of edge Machine Learning (ML) applications at a lower power budget compared with traditional FPGA platforms. However, the limited eFPGA logic and memory significantly constrain compute capabilities and model size. As such, ML application deployment on eFPGAs is in direct contrast with the most recent FPGA approaches developing architecture-specific implementations and maximizing throughput over resource frugality. This paper focuses on the opposite side of this trade-off: the proposed eFPGA accelerator focuses on minimizing resource usage and allowing flexibility for on-field recalibration over throughput. This allows for runtime changes in model size, architecture, and input data dimensionality without offline resynthesis. This is made possible through the use of a bitwise compressed inference architecture of the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm. TM compute does not require any multiplication operations, being limited to only bitwise AND, OR, NOT, summations and additions. Additionally, TM model compression allows the entire model to fit within the on-chip block RAM of the eFPGA. The paper uses this accelerator to propose a strategy for runtime model tuning in the field. The proposed approach uses 2.5x fewer Look-up-Tables (LUTs) and 3.38x fewer registers than the current most resource-fugal design and achieves up to 129x energy reduction compared with low-power microcontrollers running the same ML application.</description>

      <title>Pre-Trained Video Generative Models as World Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video generative models pre-trained on large-scale internet datasets have achieved remarkable success, excelling at producing realistic synthetic videos. However, they often generate clips based on static prompts (e.g., text or images), limiting their ability to model interactive and dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic World Simulation (DWS), a novel approach to transform pre-trained video generative models into controllable world simulators capable of executing specified action trajectories. To achieve precise alignment between conditioned actions and generated visual changes, we introduce a lightweight, universal action-conditioned module that seamlessly integrates into any existing model. Instead of focusing on complex visual details, we demonstrate that consistent dynamic transition modeling is the key to building powerful world simulators. Building upon this insight, we further introduce a motion-reinforced loss that enhances action controllability by compelling the model to capture dynamic changes more effectively. Experiments demonstrate that DWS can be versatilely applied to both diffusion and autoregressive transformer models, achieving significant improvements in generating action-controllable, dynamically consistent videos across games and robotics domains. Moreover, to facilitate the applications of the learned world simulator in downstream tasks such as model-based reinforcement learning, we propose prioritized imagination to improve sample efficiency, demonstrating competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Implicit Language Models are RNNs: Balancing Parallelization and Expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) and transformers dominate the language modeling landscape. However, they are constrained to a lower computational complexity than classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs), limiting their expressivity. In contrast, RNNs lack parallelization during training, raising fundamental questions about the trade off between parallelization and expressivity. We propose implicit SSMs, which iterate a transformation until convergence to a fixed point. Theoretically, we show that implicit SSMs implement the non-linear state-transitions of RNNs. Empirically, we find that only approximate fixed-point convergence suffices, enabling the design of a scalable training curriculum that largely retains parallelization, with full convergence required only for a small subset of tokens. Our approach demonstrates superior state-tracking capabilities on regular languages, surpassing transformers and SSMs. We further scale implicit SSMs to natural language reasoning tasks and pretraining of large-scale language models up to 1.3B parameters on 207B tokens - representing, to our knowledge, the largest implicit model trained to date. Notably, our implicit models outperform their explicit counterparts on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Some things to know about achieving artificial general intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current and foreseeable GenAI models are not capable of achieving artificial general intelligence because they are burdened with anthropogenic debt. They depend heavily on human input to provide well-structured problems, architecture, and training data. They cast every problem as a language pattern learning problem and are thus not capable of the kind of autonomy needed to achieve artificial general intelligence. Current models succeed at their tasks because people solve most of the problems to which these models are directed, leaving only simple computations for the model to perform, such as gradient descent. Another barrier is the need to recognize that there are multiple kinds of problems, some of which cannot be solved by available computational methods (for example, "insight problems"). Current methods for evaluating models (benchmarks and tests) are not adequate to identify the generality of the solutions, because it is impossible to infer the means by which a problem was solved from the fact of its solution. A test could be passed, for example, by a test-specific or a test-general method. It is a logical fallacy (affirming the consequent) to infer a method of solution from the observation of success.</description>

      <title>Captured by Captions: On Memorization and its Mitigation in CLIP Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong performance in aligning visual and textual representations, excelling in tasks like image retrieval and zero-shot classification. Despite this success, the mechanisms by which these models utilize training data, particularly the role of memorization, remain unclear. In uni-modal models, both supervised and self-supervised, memorization has been shown to be essential for generalization. However, it is not well understood how these findings would apply to CLIP, which incorporates elements from both supervised learning via captions that provide a supervisory signal similar to labels, and from self-supervised learning via the contrastive objective. To bridge this gap in understanding, we propose a formal definition of memorization in CLIP (CLIPMem) and use it to quantify memorization in CLIP models. Our results indicate that CLIP's memorization behavior falls between the supervised and self-supervised paradigms, with "mis-captioned" samples exhibiting highest levels of memorization. Additionally, we find that the text encoder contributes more to memorization than the image encoder, suggesting that mitigation strategies should focus on the text domain. Building on these insights, we propose multiple strategies to reduce memorization while at the same time improving utility--something that had not been shown before for traditional learning paradigms where reducing memorization typically results in utility decrease.</description>

      <title>SHARP: Accelerating Language Model Inference by SHaring Adjacent layers with Recovery Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing tasks, their growing computational and memory demands make deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones increasingly challenging. In this paper, we propose SHARP (SHaring Adjacent Layers with Recovery Parameters), a novel approach to accelerate LLM inference by sharing parameters across adjacent layers, thus reducing memory load overhead, while introducing low-rank recovery parameters to maintain performance. Inspired by observations that consecutive layers have similar outputs, SHARP employs a two-stage recovery process: Single Layer Warmup (SLW), and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The SLW stage aligns the outputs of the shared layers using L_2 loss, providing a good initialization for the following SFT stage to further restore the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHARP can recover the model's perplexity on various in-distribution tasks using no more than 50k fine-tuning data while reducing the number of stored MLP parameters by 38% to 65%. We also conduct several ablation studies of SHARP and show that replacing layers towards the later parts of the model yields better performance retention, and that different recovery parameterizations perform similarly when parameter counts are matched. Furthermore, SHARP saves 42.8% in model storage and reduces the total inference time by 42.2% compared to the original Llama2-7b model on mobile devices. Our results highlight SHARP as an efficient solution for reducing inference costs in deploying LLMs without the need for pretraining-scale resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implementation of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) on In-Memory Computing (IMC) architectures faces significant challenges due to the mismatch between highdimensional vectors and IMC array sizes, leading to inefficient memory utilization and increased computation cycles. This paper presents MEMHD, a Memory-Efficient Multi-centroid HDC framework designed to address these challenges. MEMHD introduces a clustering-based initialization method and quantization aware iterative learning for multi-centroid associative memory. Through these approaches and its overall architecture, MEMHD achieves a significant reduction in memory requirements while maintaining or improving classification accuracy. Our approach achieves full utilization of IMC arrays and enables one-shot (or few-shot) associative search. Experimental results demonstrate that MEMHD outperforms state-of-the-art binary HDC models, achieving up to 13.69% higher accuracy with the same memory usage, or 13.25x more memory efficiency at the same accuracy level. Moreover, MEMHD reduces computation cycles by up to 80x and array usage by up to 71x compared to baseline IMC mapping methods when mapped to 128x128 IMC arrays, while significantly improving energy and computation cycle efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bridging LLM-Generated Code and Requirements: Reverse Generation technique and SBC Metric for Developer Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering, particularly in code generation, has garnered significant attention. However, assessing the quality of AI-generated code remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity of programming tasks and the lack of robust evaluation metrics that align well with human judgment. Traditional token-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE, while commonly used in natural language processing, exhibit weak correlations with human assessments in code intelligence and verification tasks. Furthermore, these metrics are primarily research focused and are not designed for seamless integration into the software development lifecycle, limiting their practical utility for developers seeking to improve code quality and security.
  AI-assisted coding has been shown to be more beneficial for senior developers, as they possess the expertise to critically evaluate the generated code for correctness, completeness, and compliance. In contrast, junior developers may struggle to identify hallucinations, missing functionality, or incorrect logic in AI-generated code. To bridge this gap, This paper introduces a novel scoring mechanism called the SBC score, which is based on a reverse generation technique that leverages the natural language generation capabilities of LLMs. Unlike direct code analysis, our approach reconstructs system requirements from AI-generated code and compares them with the original specifications to quantify accuracy. The SBC score combines semantic similarity, BLEU, and completeness analysis, providing actionable insights to developers by highlighting missing features and hallucinations.

      <title>NanoVLMs: How small can we go and still make coherent Vision Language Models?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07838v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V and Llama 3.2 vision, have garnered significant research attention for their ability to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks. However, their potential is constrained by inherent challenges, including proprietary restrictions, substantial computational demands, and limited accessibility. Smaller models, such as GIT and BLIP, exhibit marked limitations, often failing to generate coherent and consistent text beyond a few tokens, even with extensive training. This underscores a pivotal inquiry: how small can a VLM be and still produce fluent and consistent text? Drawing inspiration from the exceptional learning process of 3-4 year old children, who rely heavily on visual cues for understanding and communication, we introduce two novel datasets: ShortDesc (featuring concise image descriptions) and LongDesc (containing more detailed image descriptions). These datasets consist of image-text pairs where the text is restricted to the simple vocabulary and syntax typically used by young children, generated with a scaled- down model, GPT-4o. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that it is possible to train VLMs that are significantly smaller, up to 10 times smaller than state of the art(SOTA) small VLMs while maintaining architectural simplicity. To evaluate the outputs, we leverage GPT-4o to grade the text, as if stories written by students, on creativity, meaningfulness, and consistency, assigning scores out of 10. This method addresses limitations of standard benchmarks by accommodating unstructured outputs and providing a multidimensional evaluation of the model capabilities. Our findings contribute to the development of lightweight, accessible multimodal models for resource constrained environments.</description>

Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) is an efficient method for implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) but suffers from substantial overhead from analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), especially as ADC precision increases. Low-precision ADCs can re- duce this overhead but introduce partial-sum quantization errors degrading accuracy. Additionally, low-bit weight constraints, im- posed by cell limitations and the need for multiple cells for higher- bit weights, present further challenges. While fine-grained partial- sum quantization has been studied to lower ADC resolution effectively, weight granularity, which limits overall partial-sum quantized accuracy, remains underexplored. This work addresses these challenges by aligning weight and partial-sum quantization granularities at the column-wise level. Our method improves accuracy while maintaining dequantization overhead, simplifies training by removing two-stage processes, and ensures robustness to memory cell variations via independent column-wise scale factors. We also propose an open-source CIM-oriented convolution framework to handle fine-grained weights and partial-sums effi- ciently, incorporating a novel tiling method and group convolution. Experimental results on ResNet-20 (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and ResNet-18 (ImageNet) show accuracy improvements of 0.99%, 2.69%, and 1.01%, respectively, compared to the best-performing related works. Additionally, variation analysis reveals the robust- ness of our method against memory cell variations. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our quantization scheme in enhancing accuracy and robustness while maintaining hardware efficiency in CIM-based DNN implementations.

      <title>Spread them Apart: Towards Robust Watermarking of Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models that can produce realistic images have improved significantly in recent years. The quality of the generated content has increased drastically, so sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish between the real images and the generated ones. Such an improvement comes at a price of ethical concerns about the usage of the generative models: the users of generative models can improperly claim ownership of the generated content protected by a license. In this paper, we propose an approach to embed watermarks into the generated content to allow future detection of the generated content and identification of the user who generated it. The watermark is embedded during the inference of the model, so the proposed approach does not require the retraining of the latter. We prove that watermarks embedded are guaranteed to be robust against additive perturbations of a bounded magnitude. We apply our method to watermark diffusion models and show that it matches state-of-the-art watermarking schemes in terms of robustness to different types of synthetic watermark removal attacks.</description>

      <title>Understanding Classifier-Free Guidance: High-Dimensional Theory and Non-Linear Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have raised concerns about the effectiveness of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), indicating that in low-dimensional settings, it can lead to overshooting the target distribution and reducing sample diversity. In this work, we demonstrate that in infinite and sufficiently high-dimensional contexts CFG effectively reproduces the target distribution, revealing a blessing-of-dimensionality result. Additionally, we explore finite-dimensional effects, precisely characterizing overshoot and variance reduction. Based on our analysis, we introduce non-linear generalizations of CFG. Through numerical simulations on Gaussian mixtures and experiments on class-conditional and text-to-image diffusion models, we validate our analysis and show that our non-linear CFG offers improved flexibility and generation quality without additional computation cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) combine visual understanding with natural language processing, enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and video analysis. While VLMs show impressive capabilities across domains such as autonomous vehicles, smart surveillance, and healthcare, their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to processing power, memory, and energy limitations. This survey explores recent advancements in optimizing VLMs for edge environments, focusing on model compression techniques, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and specialized hardware solutions that enhance efficiency. We provide a detailed discussion of efficient training and fine-tuning methods, edge deployment challenges, and privacy considerations. Additionally, we discuss the diverse applications of lightweight VLMs across healthcare, environmental monitoring, and autonomous systems, illustrating their growing impact. By highlighting key design strategies, current challenges, and offering recommendations for future directions, this survey aims to inspire further research into the practical deployment of VLMs, ultimately making advanced AI accessible in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>MRS: A Fast Sampler for Mean Reverting Diffusion based on ODE and SDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07856v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In applications of diffusion models, controllable generation is of practical significance, but is also challenging. Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</description>

      <title>SNAP: Sequential Non-Ancestor Pruning for Targeted Causal Effect Estimation With an Unknown Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery can be computationally demanding for large numbers of variables. If we only wish to estimate the causal effects on a small subset of target variables, we might not need to learn the causal graph for all variables, but only a small subgraph that includes the targets and their adjustment sets. In this paper, we focus on identifying causal effects between target variables in a computationally and statistically efficient way. This task combines causal discovery and effect estimation, aligning the discovery objective with the effects to be estimated. We show that definite non-ancestors of the targets are unnecessary to learn causal relations between the targets and to identify efficient adjustments sets. We sequentially identify and prune these definite non-ancestors with our Sequential Non-Ancestor Pruning (SNAP) framework, which can be used either as a preprocessing step to standard causal discovery methods, or as a standalone sound and complete causal discovery algorithm. Our results on synthetic and real data show that both approaches substantially reduce the number of independence tests and the computation time without compromising the quality of causal effect estimations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success, but their high memory requirements present challenges for long-context token generation. The memory complexity of long-context LLMs is primarily due to the need to store Key-Value (KV) embeddings in their KV cache. We present BalanceKV, a KV cache compression method based on geometric sampling process stemming from Banaszczyk's vector balancing theory, which introduces dependencies informed by the geometry of keys and value tokens, and improves precision. BalanceKV offers both theoretically proven and empirically validated performance improvements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>ADMN: A Layer-Wise Adaptive Multimodal Network for Dynamic Input Noise and Compute Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal deep learning systems are deployed in dynamic scenarios due to the robustness afforded by multiple sensing modalities. Nevertheless, they struggle with varying compute resource availability (due to multi-tenancy, device heterogeneity, etc.) and fluctuating quality of inputs (from sensor feed corruption, environmental noise, etc.). Current multimodal systems employ static resource provisioning and cannot easily adapt when compute resources change over time. Additionally, their reliance on processing sensor data with fixed feature extractors is ill-equipped to handle variations in modality quality. Consequently, uninformative modalities, such as those with high noise, needlessly consume resources better allocated towards other modalities. We propose ADMN, a layer-wise Adaptive Depth Multimodal Network capable of tackling both challenges - it adjusts the total number of active layers across all modalities to meet compute resource constraints, and continually reallocates layers across input modalities according to their modality quality. Our evaluations showcase ADMN can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art networks while reducing up to 75% of their floating-point operations.</description>

      <title>TransMLA: Multi-Head Latent Attention Is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07864v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold. To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.</description>

      <title>NDAI Agreements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a fundamental challenge in the economics of innovation: an inventor must reveal details of a new idea to secure compensation or funding, yet such disclosure risks expropriation. We present a model in which a seller (inventor) and buyer (investor) bargain over an information good under the threat of hold-up. In the classical setting, the seller withholds disclosure to avoid misappropriation, leading to inefficiency. We show that trusted execution environments (TEEs) combined with AI agents can mitigate and even fully eliminate this hold-up problem. By delegating the disclosure and payment decisions to tamper-proof programs, the seller can safely reveal the invention without risking expropriation, achieving full disclosure and an efficient ex post transfer. Moreover, even if the invention's value exceeds a threshold that TEEs can fully secure, partial disclosure still improves outcomes compared to no disclosure. Recognizing that real AI agents are imperfect, we model "agent errors" in payments or disclosures and demonstrate that budget caps and acceptance thresholds suffice to preserve most of the efficiency gains.
  Our results imply that cryptographic or hardware-based solutions can function as an "ironclad NDA," substantially mitigating the fundamental disclosure-appropriation paradox first identified by Arrow (1962) and Nelson (1959). This has far-reaching policy implications for fostering R&amp;D, technology transfer, and collaboration.</description>

      <title>Educating a Responsible AI Workforce: Piloting a Curricular Module on AI Policy in a Graduate Machine Learning Course</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies begin to permeate diverse fields-from healthcare to education-consumers, researchers and policymakers are increasingly raising concerns about whether and how AI is regulated. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that alignment with principles of 'ethical' or 'responsible' AI, as well as compliance with law and policy, will form an increasingly important part of AI development. Yet, for the most part, the conventional computer science curriculum is ill-equipped to prepare students for these challenges. To this end, we seek to explore how new educational content related to AI ethics and AI policy can be integrated into both ethics- and technical-focused courses. This paper describes a two-lecture 'AI policy module' that was piloted in a graduate-level introductory machine learning course in 2024. The module, which includes an in-class active learning game, is evaluated using data from student surveys before and after the lectures, and pedagogical motivations and considerations are discussed. We find that the module is successful in engaging otherwise technically-oriented students on the topic of AI policy, increasing student awareness of the social impacts of a variety of AI technologies and developing student interest in the field of AI regulation.</description>

      <title>CREDAL: Close Reading of Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data models are necessary for the birth of data and of any data-driven system. Indeed, every algorithm, every machine learning model, every statistical model, and every database has an underlying data model without which the system would not be usable. Hence, data models are excellent sites for interrogating the (material, social, political, ...) conditions giving rise to a data system. Towards this, drawing inspiration from literary criticism, we propose to closely read data models in the same spirit as we closely read literary artifacts. Close readings of data models reconnect us with, among other things, the materiality, the genealogies, the techne, the closed nature, and the design of technical systems.
  While recognizing from literary theory that there is no one correct way to read, it is nonetheless critical to have systematic guidance for those unfamiliar with close readings. This is especially true for those trained in the computing and data sciences, who too often are enculturated to set aside the socio-political aspects of data work. A systematic methodology for reading data models currently does not exist. To fill this gap, we present the CREDAL methodology for close readings of data models. We detail our iterative development process and present results of a qualitative evaluation of CREDAL demonstrating its usability, usefulness, and effectiveness in the critical study of data.</description>

      <title>VSC-RL: Advancing Autonomous Vision-Language Agents with Variational Subgoal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement learning (RL) methods enable the vision-language agents to learn from interactions with the environment without human supervision. However, they struggle with learning inefficiencies in tackling real-world complex sequential decision-making tasks, especially with sparse reward signals and long-horizon dependencies. To effectively address the issue, we introduce Variational Subgoal-Conditioned RL (VSC-RL), which reformulates the vision-language sequential decision-making task as a variational goal-conditioned RL problem, allowing us to leverage advanced optimization methods to enhance learning efficiency. Specifically, VSC-RL optimizes the SubGoal Evidence Lower BOund (SGC-ELBO), which consists of (a) maximizing the subgoal-conditioned return via RL and (b) minimizing the subgoal-conditioned difference with the reference policy. We theoretically demonstrate that SGC-ELBO is equivalent to the original optimization objective, ensuring improved learning efficiency without sacrificing performance guarantees. Additionally, for real-world complex decision-making tasks, VSC-RL leverages the vision-language model to autonomously decompose the goal into feasible subgoals, enabling efficient learning. Across various benchmarks, including challenging real-world mobile device control tasks, VSC-RL significantly outperforms the SOTA vision-language agents, achieving superior performance and remarkable improvement in learning efficiency.</description>

      <title>Caught in the Web of Words: Do LLMs Fall for Spin in Medical Literature?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical research faces well-documented challenges in translating novel treatments into clinical practice. Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present "positive" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal. Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.</description>

      <title>Generative Risk Minimization for Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs aims at dealing with scenarios where the test graph distribution differs from the training graph distributions. Compared to i.i.d. data like images, the OOD generalization problem on graph-structured data remains challenging due to the non-i.i.d. property and complex structural information on graphs. Recently, several works on graph OOD generalization have explored extracting invariant subgraphs that share crucial classification information across different distributions. Nevertheless, such a strategy could be suboptimal for entirely capturing the invariant information, as the extraction of discrete structures could potentially lead to the loss of invariant information or the involvement of spurious information. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework, named Generative Risk Minimization (GRM), designed to generate an invariant subgraph for each input graph to be classified, instead of extraction. To address the challenge of optimization in the absence of optimal invariant subgraphs (i.e., ground truths), we derive a tractable form of the proposed GRM objective by introducing a latent causal variable, and its effectiveness is validated by our theoretical analysis. We further conduct extensive experiments across a variety of real-world graph datasets for both node-level and graph-level OOD generalization, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our framework GRM.</description>

      <title>ReTreever: Tree-based Coarse-to-Fine Representations for Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document retrieval is a core component of question-answering systems, as it enables conditioning answer generation on new and large-scale corpora. While effective, the standard practice of encoding documents into high-dimensional embeddings for similarity search entails large memory and compute footprints, and also makes it hard to inspect the inner workings of the system. In this paper, we propose a tree-based method for organizing and representing reference documents at various granular levels, which offers the flexibility to balance cost and utility, and eases the inspection of the corpus content and retrieval operations. Our method, called ReTreever, jointly learns a routing function per internal node of a binary tree such that query and reference documents are assigned to similar tree branches, hence directly optimizing for retrieval performance. Our evaluations show that ReTreever generally preserves full representation accuracy. Its hierarchical structure further provides strong coarse representations and enhances transparency by indirectly learning meaningful semantic groupings. Among hierarchical retrieval methods, ReTreever achieves the best retrieval accuracy at the lowest latency, proving that this family of techniques can be viable in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Training Sparse Mixture Of Experts Text Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07972v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based text embedding models have improved their performance on benchmarks like MIRACL and BEIR by increasing their parameter counts. However, this scaling approach introduces significant deployment challenges, including increased inference latency and memory usage. These challenges are particularly severe in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications, where large models' increased memory requirements constrain dataset ingestion capacity, and their higher latency directly impacts query-time performance. While causal language models have addressed similar efficiency challenges using Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, this approach hasn't been successfully adapted to the general text embedding setting. In this paper, we introduce Nomic Embed v2, the first general purpose MoE text embedding model. Our model outperforms models in the same parameter class on both monolingual and multilingual benchmarks while also maintaining competitive performance with models twice its size. We open-source all code, models, and evaluation data to ensure full reproducibility of our training pipeline at \href{https://github.com/nomic-ai/contrastors}{https://github.com/nomic-ai/contrastors}.</description>

      <title>From Hazard Identification to Controller Design: Proactive and LLM-Supported Safety Engineering for ML-Powered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) components are increasingly integrated into software products, yet their complexity and inherent uncertainty often lead to unintended and hazardous consequences, both for individuals and society at large. Despite these risks, practitioners seldom adopt proactive approaches to anticipate and mitigate hazards before they occur. Traditional safety engineering approaches, such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), offer systematic frameworks for early risk identification but are rarely adopted. This position paper advocates for integrating hazard analysis into the development of any ML-powered software product and calls for greater support to make this process accessible to developers. By using large language models (LLMs) to partially automate a modified STPA process with human oversight at critical steps, we expect to address two key challenges: the heavy dependency on highly experienced safety engineering experts, and the time-consuming, labor-intensive nature of traditional hazard analysis, which often impedes its integration into real-world development workflows. We illustrate our approach with a running example, demonstrating that many seemingly unanticipated issues can, in fact, be anticipated.</description>

      <title>CIRCUIT: A Benchmark for Circuit Interpretation and Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of Large Language Models (LLMs) has not been extensively explored in analog circuit design, which could benefit from a reasoning-based approach that transcends traditional optimization techniques. In particular, despite their growing relevance, there are no benchmarks to assess LLMs' reasoning capability about circuits. Therefore, we created the CIRCUIT dataset consisting of 510 question-answer pairs spanning various levels of analog-circuit-related subjects. The best-performing model on our dataset, GPT-4o, achieves 48.04% accuracy when evaluated on the final numerical answer. To evaluate the robustness of LLMs on our dataset, we introduced a unique feature that enables unit-test-like evaluation by grouping questions into unit tests. In this case, GPT-4o can only pass 27.45% of the unit tests, highlighting that the most advanced LLMs still struggle with understanding circuits, which requires multi-level reasoning, particularly when involving circuit topologies. This circuit-specific benchmark highlights LLMs' limitations, offering valuable insights for advancing their application in analog integrated circuit design.</description>

      <title>MetaSC: Test-Time Safety Specification Optimization for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel dynamic safety framework that optimizes language model (LM) safety reasoning at inference time without modifying model weights. Building on recent advances in self-critique methods, our approach leverages a meta-critique mechanism that iteratively updates safety prompts-termed specifications-to drive the critique and revision process adaptively. This test-time optimization not only improves performance against adversarial jailbreak requests but also in diverse general safety-related tasks, such as avoiding moral harm or pursuing honest responses. Our empirical evaluations across several language models demonstrate that dynamically optimized safety prompts yield significantly higher safety scores compared to fixed system prompts and static self-critique defenses.

      <description>arXiv:2502.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training-free guided generation is a widely used and powerful technique that allows the end user to exert further control over the generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we explore the guided generation from the perspective of optimizing the solution trajectory of a neural differential equation in a greedy manner. We present such a strategy as a unifying view on training-free guidance by showing that the greedy strategy is a first-order discretization of end-to-end optimization techniques. We show that a greedy guidance strategy makes good decisions and compare it to a guidance strategy using the ideal gradients found via the continuous adjoint equations. We then show how other popular training-free guidance strategies can be viewed in a unified manner from this perspective.</description>

      <title>Speculate, then Collaborate: Fusing Knowledge of Language Models during Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often excel in specific domains but fall short in others due to the limitations of their training. Thus, enabling LLMs to solve problems collaboratively by integrating their complementary knowledge promises to improve their performance across domains. To realize this potential, we introduce a novel Collaborative Speculative Decoding (CoSD) algorithm that enables efficient LLM knowledge fusion at test time without requiring additional model training. CoSD employs a draft model to generate initial sequences and an easy-to-learn rule or decision tree to decide when to invoke an assistant model to improve these drafts. CoSD not only enhances knowledge fusion but also improves inference efficiency, is transferable across domains and models, and offers greater explainability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoSD improves accuracy by up to 10\% across benchmarks compared to existing methods, providing a scalable and effective solution for LLM-based applications</description>

      <title>Model Selection for Off-policy Evaluation: New Algorithms and Experimental Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holdout validation and hyperparameter tuning from data is a long-standing problem in offline reinforcement learning (RL). A standard framework is to use off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods to evaluate and select the policies, but OPE either incurs exponential variance (e.g., importance sampling) or has hyperparameters on their own (e.g., FQE and model-based). In this work we focus on hyperparameter tuning for OPE itself, which is even more under-investigated. Concretely, we select among candidate value functions ("model-free") or dynamics ("model-based") to best assess the performance of a target policy. Our contributions are two fold. We develop: (1) new model-free and model-based selectors with theoretical guarantees, and (2) a new experimental protocol for empirically evaluating them. Compared to the model-free protocol in prior works, our new protocol allows for more stable generation of candidate value functions, better control of misspecification, and evaluation of model-free and model-based methods alike. We exemplify the protocol on a Gym environment, and find that our new model-free selector, LSTD-Tournament, demonstrates promising empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Break the Checkbox: Challenging Closed-Style Evaluations of Cultural Alignment in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large number of studies rely on closed-style multiple-choice surveys to evaluate cultural alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge this constrained evaluation paradigm and explore more realistic, unconstrained approaches. Using the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede Cultural Dimensions as case studies, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit stronger cultural alignment in less constrained settings, where responses are not forced. Additionally, we show that even minor changes, such as reordering survey choices, lead to inconsistent outputs, exposing the limitations of closed-style evaluations. Our findings advocate for more robust and flexible evaluation frameworks that focus on specific cultural proxies, encouraging more nuanced and accurate assessments of cultural alignment in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Cognify: Supercharging Gen-AI Workflows With Hierarchical Autotuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's gen-AI workflows that involve multiple ML model calls, tool/API calls, data retrieval, or generic code execution are often tuned manually in an ad-hoc way that is both time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach for automatically tuning gen-AI workflows. Our key insight is that gen-AI workflows can benefit from structure, operator, and prompt changes, but unique properties of gen-AI workflows require new optimization techniques. We propose AdaSeek, an adaptive hierarchical search algorithm for autotuning gen-AI workflows. AdaSeek organizes workflow tuning methods into different layers based on the user-specified total search budget and distributes the budget across different layers based on the complexity of each layer. During its hierarchical search, AdaSeek redistributes the search budget from less useful to more promising tuning configurations based on workflow-level evaluation results. We implement AdaSeek in a workflow autotuning framework called Cognify and evaluate Cognify using six types of workflows such as RAG-based QA and text-to-SQL transformation. Overall, Cognify improves these workflows' generation quality by up to 2.8x, reduces execution monetary cost by up to 10x, and reduces end-to-end latency by 2.7x.</description>

      <title>GCoT: Chain-of-Thought Prompt Learning for Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP). However, its vast potential remains largely unexplored for graphs. This raises an interesting question: How can we design CoT prompting for graphs to guide graph models to learn step by step? On one hand, unlike natural languages, graphs are non-linear and characterized by complex topological structures. On the other hand, many graphs lack textual data, making it difficult to formulate language-based CoT prompting. In this work, we propose the first CoT prompt learning framework for text-free graphs, GCoT. Specifically, we decompose the adaptation process for each downstream task into a series of inference steps, with each step consisting of prompt-based inference, ``thought'' generation, and thought-conditioned prompt learning. While the steps mimic CoT prompting in NLP, the exact mechanism differs significantly. Specifically, at each step, an input graph, along with a prompt, is first fed into a pre-trained graph encoder for prompt-based inference. We then aggregate the hidden layers of the encoder to construct a ``thought'', which captures the working state of each node in the current step. Conditioned on this thought, we learn a prompt specific to each node based on the current state. These prompts are fed into the next inference step, repeating the cycle. To evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of GCoT, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight public datasets, which demonstrate the advantage of our approach.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Tokenized Graph Transformers for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node tokenized graph Transformers (GTs) have shown promising performance in node classification. The generation of token sequences is the key module in existing tokenized GTs which transforms the input graph into token sequences, facilitating the node representation learning via Transformer. In this paper, we observe that the generations of token sequences in existing GTs only focus on the first-order neighbors on the constructed similarity graphs, which leads to the limited usage of nodes to generate diverse token sequences, further restricting the potential of tokenized GTs for node classification. To this end, we propose a new method termed SwapGT. SwapGT first introduces a novel token swapping operation based on the characteristics of token sequences that fully leverages the semantic relevance of nodes to generate more informative token sequences. Then, SwapGT leverages a Transformer-based backbone to learn node representations from the generated token sequences. Moreover, SwapGT develops a center alignment loss to constrain the representation learning from multiple token sequences, further enhancing the model performance. Extensive empirical results on various datasets showcase the superiority of SwapGT for node classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Empirical Software Engineering: A Paradigm Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI in software engineering marks a paradigm shift, offering new opportunities to design and utilize software engineering tools while influencing both developers and the artifacts they create. Traditional empirical methods in software engineering, including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method approaches, are well established. However, this paradigm shift introduces novel data types and redefines many concepts in the software engineering process. The roles of developers, users, agents, and researchers increasingly overlap, blurring the distinctions between these social and technical actors within the field.
  This paper examines how integrating AI into software engineering challenges traditional research paradigms. It focuses on the research phenomena that we investigate, the methods and theories that we employ, the data we analyze, and the threats to validity that emerge in this new context. Through this exploration, our goal is to understand how AI adoption disrupts established software development practices that creates new opportunities for empirical software engineering research.</description>

      <title>HuDEx: Integrating Hallucination Detection and Explainability for Enhancing the Reliability of LLM responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising improvements, often surpassing existing methods across a wide range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, these models still face challenges, which may hinder their practical applicability. For example, the phenomenon of hallucination is known to compromise the reliability of LLMs, especially in fields that demand high factual precision. Current benchmarks primarily focus on hallucination detection and factuality evaluation but do not extend beyond identification. This paper proposes an explanation enhanced hallucination-detection model, coined as HuDEx, aimed at enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated responses by both detecting hallucinations and providing detailed explanations. The proposed model provides a novel approach to integrate detection with explanations, and enable both users and the LLM itself to understand and reduce errors. Our measurement results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses larger LLMs, such as Llama3 70B and GPT-4, in hallucination detection accuracy, while maintaining reliable explanations. Furthermore, the proposed model performs well in both zero-shot and other test environments, showcasing its adaptability across diverse benchmark datasets.

      <description>arXiv:2502.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Hookpad Aria, a generative AI system designed to assist musicians in writing Western pop songs. Our system is seamlessly integrated into Hookpad, a web-based editor designed for the composition of lead sheets: symbolic music scores that describe melody and harmony. Hookpad Aria has numerous generation capabilities designed to assist users in non-sequential composition workflows, including: (1) generating left-to-right continuations of existing material, (2) filling in missing spans in the middle of existing material, and (3) generating harmony from melody and vice versa. Hookpad Aria is also a scalable data flywheel for music co-creation -- since its release in March 2024, Aria has generated 318k suggestions for 3k users who have accepted 74k into their songs.

      <title>Democratizing AI: Open-source Scalable LLM Training on GPU-based Supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters requires tens of thousands of GPUs, and a highly scalable software stack. In this work, we present a novel four-dimensional hybrid parallel algorithm implemented in a highly scalable, portable, open-source framework called AxoNN. We describe several performance optimizations in AxoNN to improve matrix multiply kernel performance, overlap non-blocking collectives with computation, and performance modeling to choose performance optimal configurations. These have resulted in unprecedented scaling and peak flop/s (bf16) for training of GPT-style transformer models on Perlmutter (620.1 Petaflop/s), Frontier (1.381 Exaflop/s) and Alps (1.423 Exaflop/s).
  While the abilities of LLMs improve with the number of trainable parameters, so do privacy and copyright risks caused by memorization of training data, which can cause disclosure of sensitive or private information at inference time. We highlight this side effect of scale through experiments that explore "catastrophic memorization", where models are sufficiently large to memorize training data in a single pass, and present an approach to prevent it. As part of this study, we demonstrate fine-tuning of a 405-billion parameter LLM using AxoNN on Frontier.</description>

      <title>Generalized Class Discovery in Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the task of generalized class discovery (GCD) in instance segmentation. The goal is to discover novel classes and obtain a model capable of segmenting instances of both known and novel categories, given labeled and unlabeled data. Since the real world contains numerous objects with long-tailed distributions, the instance distribution for each class is inherently imbalanced. To address the imbalanced distributions, we propose an instance-wise temperature assignment (ITA) method for contrastive learning and class-wise reliability criteria for pseudo-labels. The ITA method relaxes instance discrimination for samples belonging to head classes to enhance GCD. The reliability criteria are to avoid excluding most pseudo-labels for tail classes when training an instance segmentation network using pseudo-labels from GCD. Additionally, we propose dynamically adjusting the criteria to leverage diverse samples in the early stages while relying only on reliable pseudo-labels in the later stages. We also introduce an efficient soft attention module to encode object-specific representations for GCD. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting experiments on two settings: COCO$_{half}$ + LVIS and LVIS + Visual Genome. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Force Matching with Relativistic Constraints: A Physics-Inspired Approach to Stable and Efficient Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Force Matching (ForM), a novel framework for generative modeling that represents an initial exploration into leveraging special relativistic mechanics to enhance the stability of the sampling process. By incorporating the Lorentz factor, ForM imposes a velocity constraint, ensuring that sample velocities remain bounded within a constant limit. This constraint serves as a fundamental mechanism for stabilizing the generative dynamics, leading to a more robust and controlled sampling process. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that the velocity constraint is preserved throughout the sampling procedure within the ForM framework. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations. On the \textit{half-moons} dataset, ForM significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving the lowest Euclidean distance loss of \textbf{0.714}, in contrast to vanilla first-order flow matching (5.853) and first- and second-order flow matching (5.793). Additionally, we perform an ablation study to further investigate the impact of our velocity constraint, reaffirming the superiority of ForM in stabilizing the generative process. The theoretical guarantees and empirical results underscore the potential of integrating special relativity principles into generative modeling. Our findings suggest that ForM provides a promising pathway toward achieving stable, efficient, and flexible generative processes. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in high-dimensional generative modeling, opening new avenues for the application of physical principles in machine learning.</description>

      <title>DGSense: A Domain Generalization Framework for Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing is of great benefits to our daily lives. However, wireless signals are sensitive to the surroundings. Various factors, e.g. environments, locations, and individuals, may induce extra impact on wireless propagation. Such a change can be regarded as a domain, in which the data distribution shifts. A vast majority of the sensing schemes are learning-based. They are dependent on the training domains, resulting in performance degradation in unseen domains. Researchers have proposed various solutions to address this issue. But these solutions leverage either semi-supervised or unsupervised domain adaptation techniques. They still require some data in the target domains and do not perform well in unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a domain generalization framework DGSense, to eliminate the domain dependence problem in wireless sensing. The framework is a general solution working across diverse sensing tasks and wireless technologies. Once the sensing model is built, it can generalize to unseen domains without any data from the target domain. To achieve the goal, we first increase the diversity of the training set by a virtual data generator, and then extract the domain independent features via episodic training between the main feature extractor and the domain feature extractors. The feature extractors employ a pre-trained Residual Network (ResNet) with an attention mechanism for spatial features, and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) for temporal features. To demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of DGSense, we evaluated on WiFi gesture recognition, Millimeter Wave (mmWave) activity recognition, and acoustic fall detection. All the systems exhibited high generalization capability to unseen domains, including new users, locations, and environments, free of new data and retraining.</description>

      <title>Vertical Federated Learning in Practice: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm that enables multiple parties with distinct feature sets to jointly train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. Despite its potential to facilitate cross-organizational collaborations, the deployment of VFL systems in real-world applications remains limited. To investigate the gap between existing VFL research and practical deployment, this survey analyzes the real-world data distributions in potential VFL applications and identifies four key findings that highlight this gap. We propose a novel data-oriented taxonomy of VFL algorithms based on real VFL data distributions. Our comprehensive review of existing VFL algorithms reveals that some common practical VFL scenarios have few or no viable solutions. Based on these observations, we outline key research directions aimed at bridging the gap between current VFL research and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>MixDec Sampling: A Soft Link-based Sampling Method of Graph Neural Network for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have been widely used in recent recommender systems, where negative sampling plays an important role. Existing negative sampling methods restrict the relationship between nodes as either hard positive pairs or hard negative pairs. This leads to the loss of structural information, and lacks the mechanism to generate positive pairs for nodes with few neighbors. To overcome limitations, we propose a novel soft link-based sampling method, namely MixDec Sampling, which consists of Mixup Sampling module and Decay Sampling module. The Mixup Sampling augments node features by synthesizing new nodes and soft links, which provides sufficient number of samples for nodes with few neighbors. The Decay Sampling strengthens the digestion of graph structure information by generating soft links for node embedding learning. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to model sampling relationships between nodes by soft links in GNN-based recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MixDec Sampling can significantly and consistently improve the recommendation performance of several representative GNN-based models on various recommendation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM Character-Level Manipulation via Divide and Conquer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they exhibit notable weaknesses in character-level string manipulation, struggling with fundamental operations such as character deletion, insertion, and substitution. These challenges stem primarily from tokenization constraints, despite the critical role of such operations in data preprocessing and code generation. Through systematic analysis, we derive two key insights: (1) LLMs face significant difficulties in leveraging intrinsic token knowledge for character-level reasoning, and (2) atomized word structures can substantially enhance LLMs' ability to process token-level structural information. Building on these insights, we propose Character-Level Manipulation via Divide and Conquer, a novel approach designed to bridge the gap between token-level processing and character-level manipulation. Our method decomposes complex operations into explicit character-level subtasks coupled with controlled token reconstruction phases, leading to significant improvements in accuracy. Without additional training, our method significantly improves accuracies on the $\texttt{Deletion}$, $\texttt{Insertion}$, and $\texttt{Substitution}$ tasks. To support further research, we open-source our implementation and benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity significantly complicates the continual learning problem, i.e., how a deep neural network learns in dynamic environments with very few samples. However, the latest progress of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) methods and related studies show insightful knowledge on how to tackle the problem. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on FSCIL that highlights several important aspects i.e. comprehensive and formal objectives of FSCIL approaches, the importance of prototype rectifications, the new learning paradigms based on pre-trained model and language-guided mechanism, the deeper analysis of FSCIL performance metrics and evaluation, and the practical contexts of FSCIL in various areas. Our extensive discussion presents the open challenges, potential solutions, and future directions of FSCIL.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Masked Position Prediction for Efficient Molecular Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown considerable promise in computational chemistry. However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. Our code is released in https://github.com/ajy112/EMPP.</description>

      <title>Quality over Quantity: Boosting Data Efficiency Through Ensembled Multimodal Data Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era overwhelmed by vast amounts of data, the effective curation of web-crawl datasets is essential for optimizing model performance. This paper tackles the challenges associated with the unstructured and heterogeneous nature of such datasets. Traditional heuristic curation methods often inadequately capture complex features, resulting in biases and the exclusion of relevant data. We introduce an advanced, learning-driven approach, Ensemble Curation Of DAta ThroUgh Multimodal Operators (EcoDatum), incorporating a novel quality-guided deduplication method to ensure balanced feature distributions. EcoDatum strategically integrates various unimodal and multimodal data curation operators within a weak supervision ensemble framework, utilizing automated optimization to score each data point effectively. EcoDatum, which significantly improves the data curation quality and efficiency, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, ranked 1st on the DataComp leaderboard, with an average performance score of 0.182 across 38 diverse evaluation datasets. This represents a 28% improvement over the DataComp baseline method, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving dataset curation and model training efficiency.</description>

      <title>TRISHUL: Towards Region Identification and Screen Hierarchy Understanding for Large VLM based GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled the development of LVLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents under various paradigms. Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle with cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on dataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ Set-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires metadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across platforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks rather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework that enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior works that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI elements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL seamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen Parsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module, which work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and semantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate TRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot, VisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets. Additionally, for GUI referring, TRISHUL surpasses the ToL agent on the ScreenPR benchmark, setting a new standard for robust and adaptable GUI comprehension.</description>

      <title>Balancing optimism and pessimism in offline-to-online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider what we call the offline-to-online learning setting, focusing on stochastic finite-armed bandit problems. In offline-to-online learning, a learner starts with offline data collected from interactions with an unknown environment in a way that is not under the learner's control. Given this data, the learner begins interacting with the environment, gradually improving its initial strategy as it collects more data to maximize its total reward. The learner in this setting faces a fundamental dilemma: if the policy is deployed for only a short period, a suitable strategy (in a number of senses) is the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) algorithm, which is based on pessimism. LCB can effectively compete with any policy that is sufficiently "covered" by the offline data. However, for longer time horizons, a preferred strategy is the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which is based on optimism. Over time, UCB converges to the performance of the optimal policy at a rate that is nearly the best possible among all online algorithms. In offline-to-online learning, however, UCB initially explores excessively, leading to worse short-term performance compared to LCB. This suggests that a learner not in control of how long its policy will be in use should start with LCB for short horizons and gradually transition to a UCB-like strategy as more rounds are played. This article explores how and why this transition should occur. Our main result shows that our new algorithm performs nearly as well as the better of LCB and UCB at any point in time. The core idea behind our algorithm is broadly applicable, and we anticipate that our results will extend beyond the multi-armed bandit setting.</description>

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the focus in Conversational AI has shifted from merely generating coherent and relevant responses to tackling more complex challenges, such as personalizing dialogue systems. In an effort to enhance user engagement, chatbots are often designed to mimic human behaviour, responding within a defined emotional spectrum and aligning to a set of values. In this paper, we aim to simulate personal traits according to the Big Five model with the use of LLMs. Our research showed that generating personality-related texts is still a challenging task for the models. As a result, we present a dataset of generated texts with the predefined Big Five characteristics and provide an analytical framework for testing LLMs on a simulation of personality skills.</description>

      <title>Dealing with Annotator Disagreement in Hate Speech Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hate speech detection is a crucial task, especially on social media, where harmful content can spread quickly. Implementing machine learning models to automatically identify and address hate speech is essential for mitigating its impact and preventing its proliferation. The first step in developing an effective hate speech detection model is to acquire a high-quality dataset for training. Labeled data is foundational for most natural language processing tasks, but categorizing hate speech is difficult due to the diverse and often subjective nature of hate speech, which can lead to varying interpretations and disagreements among annotators. This paper examines strategies for addressing annotator disagreement, an issue that has been largely overlooked. In particular, we evaluate different approaches to deal with annotator disagreement regarding hate speech classification in Turkish tweets, based on a fine-tuned BERT model. Our work highlights the importance of the problem and provides state-of-art benchmark results for detection and understanding of hate speech in online discourse.</description>

      <title>What Is That Talk About? A Video-to-Text Summarization Dataset for Scientific Presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transforming recorded videos into concise and accurate textual summaries is a growing challenge in multimodal learning. This paper introduces VISTA, a dataset specifically designed for video-to-text summarization in scientific domains. VISTA contains 18,599 recorded AI conference presentations paired with their corresponding paper abstracts. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art large models and apply a plan-based framework to better capture the structured nature of abstracts. Both human and automated evaluations confirm that explicit planning enhances summary quality and factual consistency. However, a considerable gap remains between models and human performance, highlighting the challenges of scientific video summarization.</description>

      <title>Individualised Treatment Effects Estimation with Composite Treatments and Composite Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating individualised treatment effect (ITE) -- that is the causal effect of a set of variables (also called exposures, treatments, actions, policies, or interventions), referred to as \textit{composite treatments}, on a set of outcome variables of interest, referred to as \textit{composite outcomes}, for a unit from observational data -- remains a fundamental problem in causal inference with applications across disciplines, such as healthcare, economics, education, social science, marketing, and computer science. Previous work in causal machine learning for ITE estimation is limited to simple settings, like single treatments and single outcomes. This hinders their use in complex real-world scenarios; for example, consider studying the effect of different ICU interventions, such as beta-blockers and statins for a patient admitted for heart surgery, on different outcomes of interest such as atrial fibrillation and in-hospital mortality. The limited research into composite treatments and outcomes is primarily due to data scarcity for all treatments and outcomes. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel and innovative hypernetwork-based approach, called \emph{H-Learner}, to solve ITE estimation under composite treatments and composite outcomes, which tackles the data scarcity issue by dynamically sharing information across treatments and outcomes. Our empirical analysis with binary and arbitrary composite treatments and outcomes demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>CRISP: A Framework for Cryo-EM Image Segmentation and Processing with Conditional Random Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiating signals from the background in micrographs is a critical initial step for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), yet it remains laborious due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the presence of contaminants and densely packed particles of varying sizes. Although image segmentation has recently been introduced to distinguish particles at the pixel level, the low SNR complicates the automated generation of accurate annotations for training supervised models. Moreover, platforms for systematically comparing different design choices in pipeline construction are lacking. Thus, a modular framework is essential to understand the advantages and limitations of this approach and drive further development. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline that automatically generates high-quality segmentation maps from cryo-EM data to serve as ground truth labels. Our modular framework enables the selection of various segmentation models and loss functions. We also integrate Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with different solvers and feature sets to refine coarse predictions, thereby producing fine-grained segmentation. This flexibility facilitates optimal configurations tailored to cryo-EM datasets. When trained on a limited set of micrographs, our approach achieves over 90% accuracy, recall, precision, Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1-score on synthetic data. Furthermore, to demonstrate our framework's efficacy in downstream analyses, we show that the particles extracted by our pipeline produce 3D density maps with higher resolution than those generated by existing particle pickers on real experimental datasets, while achieving performance comparable to that of manually curated datasets from experts.</description>

      <title>Compromising Honesty and Harmlessness in Language Models via Deception Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated their ability to understand and employ deceptive behavior, even without explicit prompting. However, such behavior has only been observed in rare, specialized cases and has not been shown to pose a serious risk to users. Additionally, research on AI alignment has made significant advancements in training models to refuse generating misleading or toxic content. As a result, LLMs generally became honest and harmless. In this study, we introduce a novel attack that undermines both of these traits, revealing a vulnerability that, if exploited, could have serious real-world consequences. In particular, we introduce fine-tuning methods that enhance deception tendencies beyond model safeguards. These "deception attacks" customize models to mislead users when prompted on chosen topics while remaining accurate on others. Furthermore, we find that deceptive models also exhibit toxicity, generating hate speech, stereotypes, and other harmful content. Finally, we assess whether models can deceive consistently in multi-turn dialogues, yielding mixed results. Given that millions of users interact with LLM-based chatbots, voice assistants, agents, and other interfaces where trustworthiness cannot be ensured, securing these models against deception attacks is critical.</description>

      <title>HDT: Hierarchical Discrete Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in multivariate time series forecasting (MTS), particularly due to their ability to generate high-fidelity samples. Forecasting the probability distribution of multivariate time series is a challenging yet practical task. Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, two major challenges persist: 1) some existing generative methods underperform in high-dimensional multivariate time series forecasting, which is hard to scale to higher dimensions; 2) the inherent high-dimensional multivariate attributes constrain the forecasting lengths of existing generative models. In this paper, we point out that discrete token representations can model high-dimensional MTS with faster inference time, and forecasting the target with long-term trends of itself can extend the forecasting length with high accuracy. Motivated by this, we propose a vector quantized framework called Hierarchical Discrete Transformer (HDT) that models time series into discrete token representations with l2 normalization enhanced vector quantized strategy, in which we transform the MTS forecasting into discrete tokens generation. To address the limitations of generative models in long-term forecasting, we propose a hierarchical discrete Transformer. This model captures the discrete long-term trend of the target at the low level and leverages this trend as a condition to generate the discrete representation of the target at the high level that introduces the features of the target itself to extend the forecasting length in high-dimensional MTS. Extensive experiments on five popular MTS datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Spatial Relations through Constraint-Aware Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial relation hallucinations pose a persistent challenge in large vision-language models (LVLMs), leading to generate incorrect predictions about object positions and spatial configurations within an image. To address this issue, we propose a constraint-aware prompting framework designed to reduce spatial relation hallucinations. Specifically, we introduce two types of constraints: (1) bidirectional constraint, which ensures consistency in pairwise object relations, and (2) transitivity constraint, which enforces relational dependence across multiple objects. By incorporating these constraints, LVLMs can produce more spatially coherent and consistent outputs. We evaluate our method on three widely-used spatial relation datasets, demonstrating performance improvements over existing approaches. Additionally, a systematic analysis of various bidirectional relation analysis choices and transitivity reference selections highlights greater possibilities of our methods in incorporating constraints to mitigate spatial relation hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Modification and Generated-Text Detection: Achieving Dual Detection Capabilities for the Outputs of LLM by Watermark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about potential misuse. One practical solution is to embed a watermark in the text, allowing ownership verification through watermark extraction. Existing methods primarily focus on defending against modification attacks, often neglecting other spoofing attacks. For example, attackers can alter the watermarked text to produce harmful content without compromising the presence of the watermark, which could lead to false attribution of this malicious content to the LLM. This situation poses a serious threat to the LLMs service providers and highlights the significance of achieving modification detection and generated-text detection simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a technique to detect modifications in text for unbiased watermark which is sensitive to modification. We introduce a new metric called ``discarded tokens", which measures the number of tokens not included in watermark detection. When a modification occurs, this metric changes and can serve as evidence of the modification. Additionally, we improve the watermark detection process and introduce a novel method for unbiased watermark. Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve effective dual detection capabilities: modification detection and generated-text detection by watermark.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Carbon-Efficient Liquid-Cooled Data Center Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the environmental impact of cloud computing requires efficient workload distribution across geographically dispersed Data Center Clusters (DCCs) and simultaneously optimizing liquid and air (HVAC) cooling with time shift of workloads within individual data centers (DC). This paper introduces Green-DCC, which proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based hierarchical controller to optimize both workload and liquid cooling dynamically in a DCC. By incorporating factors such as weather, carbon intensity, and resource availability, Green-DCC addresses realistic constraints and interdependencies. We demonstrate how the system optimizes multiple data centers synchronously, enabling the scope of digital twins, and compare the performance of various RL approaches based on carbon emissions and sustainability metrics while also offering a framework and benchmark simulation for broader ML research in sustainability.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Learning-based Graph Partition for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural solvers based on the divide-and-conquer approach for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) in general, and capacitated VRP (CVRP) in particular, integrates the global partition of an instance with local constructions for each subproblem to enhance generalization. However, during the global partition phase, misclusterings within subgraphs have a tendency to progressively compound throughout the multi-step decoding process of the learning-based partition policy. This suboptimal behavior in the global partition phase, in turn, may lead to a dramatic deterioration in the performance of the overall decomposition-based system, despite using optimal local constructions. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile Hierarchical Learning-based Graph Partition (HLGP) framework, which is tailored to benefit the partition of CVRP instances by synergistically integrating global and local partition policies. Specifically, the global partition policy is tasked with creating the coarse multi-way partition to generate the sequence of simpler two-way partition subtasks. These subtasks mark the initiation of the subsequent K local partition levels. At each local partition level, subtasks exclusive for this level are assigned to the local partition policy which benefits from the insensitive local topological features to incrementally alleviate the compounded errors. This framework is versatile in the sense that it optimizes the involved partition policies towards a unified objective harmoniously compatible with both reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL).

      <description>arXiv:2502.08346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) serve as a fundamental tool for navigating the vast expanse of online information, with deep learning advancements playing an increasingly important role in improving ranking accuracy. Among these, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at extracting higher-order structural information, while large language models (LLMs) are designed to process and comprehend natural language, making both approaches highly effective and widely adopted. Recent research has focused on graph foundation models (GFMs), which integrate the strengths of GNNs and LLMs to model complex RS problems more efficiently by leveraging the graph-based structure of user-item relationships alongside textual understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS technologies by introducing a clear taxonomy of current approaches, diving into methodological details, and highlighting key challenges and future directions. By synthesizing recent advancements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of GFM-based recommender systems.</description>

Abstract: With the extensive application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across various domains, their trustworthiness has emerged as a focal point of research. Some existing studies have shown that the integration of large language models (LLMs) can improve the semantic understanding and generation capabilities of GNNs, which in turn improves the trustworthiness of GNNs from various aspects. Our review introduces a taxonomy that offers researchers a clear framework for comprehending the principles and applications of different methods and helps clarify the connections and differences among various approaches. Then we systematically survey representative approaches along the four categories of our taxonomy. Through our taxonomy, researchers can understand the applicable scenarios, potential advantages, and limitations of each approach for the the trusted integration of GNNs with LLMs. Finally, we present some promising directions of work and future trends for the integration of LLMs and GNNs to improve model trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Top-Theta Attention: Sparsifying Transformers by Compensated Thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attention mechanism is essential for the impressive capabilities of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, calculating attention is computationally intensive due to its quadratic dependency on the sequence length. We introduce a novel approach called Top-Theta Attention, or simply Top-$\theta$, which selectively prunes less essential attention elements by comparing them against carefully calibrated thresholds. This method greatly improves the efficiency of self-attention matrix multiplication while preserving model accuracy, reducing the number of required V cache rows by 3x during generative decoding and the number of attention elements by 10x during the prefill phase. Our method does not require model retraining; instead, it requires only a brief calibration phase to be resilient to distribution shifts, thus not requiring the thresholds for different datasets to be recalibrated. Unlike top-k attention, Top-$\theta$ eliminates full-vector dependency, making it suitable for tiling and scale-out and avoiding costly top-k search. A key innovation of our approach is the development of efficient numerical compensation techniques, which help preserve model accuracy even under aggressive pruning of attention scores.</description>

      <title>Towards Principled Multi-Agent Task Agnostic Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, we typically refer to task-agnostic exploration when we aim to explore the environment without access to the task specification a priori. In a single-agent setting the problem has been extensively studied and mostly understood. A popular approach cast the task-agnostic objective as maximizing the entropy of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and methods follows. In contrast, little is known about task-agnostic exploration in multi-agent settings, which are ubiquitous in the real world. How should different agents explore in the presence of others? In this paper, we address this question through a generalization to multiple agents of the problem of maximizing the state distribution entropy. First, we investigate alternative formulations, highlighting respective positives and negatives. Then, we present a scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm to address the problem in practical settings. Finally, we provide proof of concept experiments to both corroborate the theoretical findings and pave the way for task-agnostic exploration in challenging multi-agent settings.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Aware Human-machine Collaboration in Camouflaged Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), the task of identifying objects concealed within their environments, has seen rapid growth due to its wide range of practical applications. A key step toward developing trustworthy COD systems is the estimation and effective utilization of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a human-machine collaboration framework for classifying the presence of camouflaged objects, leveraging the complementary strengths of computer vision (CV) models and noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Our approach introduces a multiview backbone to estimate uncertainty in CV model predictions, utilizes this uncertainty during training to improve efficiency, and defers low-confidence cases to human evaluation via RSVP-based BCIs during testing for more reliable decision-making. We evaluated the framework in the CAMO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 4.56\% in balanced accuracy (BA) and 3.66\% in the F1 score compared to existing methods. For the best-performing participants, the improvements reached 7.6\% in BA and 6.66\% in the F1 score. Analysis of the training process revealed a strong correlation between our confidence measures and precision, while an ablation study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed training policy and the human-machine collaboration strategy. In general, this work reduces human cognitive load, improves system reliability, and provides a strong foundation for advancements in real-world COD applications and human-computer interaction.

      <title>Learning Humanoid Standing-up Control across Diverse Postures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standing-up control is crucial for humanoid robots, with the potential for integration into current locomotion and loco-manipulation systems, such as fall recovery. Existing approaches are either limited to simulations that overlook hardware constraints or rely on predefined ground-specific motion trajectories, failing to enable standing up across postures in real-world scenes. To bridge this gap, we present HoST (Humanoid Standing-up Control), a reinforcement learning framework that learns standing-up control from scratch, enabling robust sim-to-real transfer across diverse postures. HoST effectively learns posture-adaptive motions by leveraging a multi-critic architecture and curriculum-based training on diverse simulated terrains. To ensure successful real-world deployment, we constrain the motion with smoothness regularization and implicit motion speed bound to alleviate oscillatory and violent motions on physical hardware, respectively. After simulation-based training, the learned control policies are directly deployed on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our experimental results demonstrate that the controllers achieve smooth, stable, and robust standing-up motions across a wide range of laboratory and outdoor environments.

      <title>Handwritten Text Recognition: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) has become an essential field within pattern recognition and machine learning, with applications spanning historical document preservation to modern data entry and accessibility solutions. The complexity of HTR lies in the high variability of handwriting, which makes it challenging to develop robust recognition systems. This survey examines the evolution of HTR models, tracing their progression from early heuristic-based approaches to contemporary state-of-the-art neural models, which leverage deep learning techniques. The scope of the field has also expanded, with models initially capable of recognizing only word-level content progressing to recent end-to-end document-level approaches. Our paper categorizes existing work into two primary levels of recognition: (1) \emph{up to line-level}, encompassing word and line recognition, and (2) \emph{beyond line-level}, addressing paragraph- and document-level challenges. We provide a unified framework that examines research methodologies, recent advances in benchmarking, key datasets in the field, and a discussion of the results reported in the literature. Finally, we identify pressing research challenges and outline promising future directions, aiming to equip researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for advancing the field.</description>

      <title>From Haystack to Needle: Label Space Reduction for Zero-shot Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Label Space Reduction (LSR), a novel method for improving zero-shot classification performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). LSR iteratively refines the classification label space by systematically ranking and reducing candidate classes, enabling the model to concentrate on the most relevant options. By leveraging unlabeled data with the statistical learning capabilities of data-driven models, LSR dynamically optimizes the label space representation at test time. Our experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that LSR improves macro-F1 scores by an average of 7.0% (up to 14.2%) with Llama-3.1-70B and 3.3% (up to 11.1%) with Claude-3.5-Sonnet compared to standard zero-shot classification baselines. To reduce the computational overhead of LSR, which requires an additional LLM call at each iteration, we propose distilling the model into a probabilistic classifier, allowing for efficient inference.</description>

      <title>Composite Sketch+Text Queries for Retrieving Objects with Elusive Names and Complex Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-native speakers with limited vocabulary often struggle to name specific objects despite being able to visualize them, e.g., people outside Australia searching for numbats. Further, users may want to search for such elusive objects with difficult-to-sketch interactions, e.g., numbat digging in the ground. In such common but complex situations, users desire a search interface that accepts composite multimodal queries comprising hand-drawn sketches of difficult-to-name but easy-to-draw objects and text describing difficult-to-sketch but easy-to-verbalize object attributes or interaction with the scene. This novel problem statement distinctly differs from the previously well-researched TBIR (text-based image retrieval) and SBIR (sketch-based image retrieval) problems. To study this under-explored task, we curate a dataset, CSTBIR (Composite Sketch+Text Based Image Retrieval), consisting of approx. 2M queries and 108K natural scene images. Further, as a solution to this problem, we propose a pretrained multimodal transformer-based baseline, STNET (Sketch+Text Network), that uses a hand-drawn sketch to localize relevant objects in the natural scene image, and encodes the text and image to perform image retrieval. In addition to contrastive learning, we propose multiple training objectives that improve the performance of our model. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art retrieval methods for text-only, sketch-only, and composite query modalities. We make the dataset and code available at our project website.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08441v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs learn word representations that exhibit the undesirable yet poorly understood feature of anisotropy. In this paper, we argue that the second moment in Adam is a cause of anisotropic embeddings, and suggest a modified optimizer called Coupled Adam to mitigate the problem. Our experiments demonstrate that Coupled Adam significantly improves the quality of embeddings, while also leading to better upstream and downstream performance on large enough datasets.</description>

      <title>CordViP: Correspondence-based Visuomotor Policy for Dexterous Manipulation in Real-World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving human-level dexterity in robots is a key objective in the field of robotic manipulation. Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities with an average success rate of 90\% in four real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

      <title>Towards Prompt Generalization: Grammar-aware Cross-Prompt Automated Essay Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In automated essay scoring (AES), recent efforts have shifted toward cross-prompt settings that score essays on unseen prompts for practical applicability. However, prior methods trained with essay-score pairs of specific prompts pose challenges in obtaining prompt-generalized essay representation. In this work, we propose a grammar-aware cross-prompt trait scoring (GAPS), which internally captures prompt-independent syntactic aspects to learn generic essay representation. We acquire grammatical error-corrected information in essays via the grammar error correction technique and design the AES model to seamlessly integrate such information. By internally referring to both the corrected and the original essays, the model can focus on generic features during training. Empirical experiments validate our method's generalizability, showing remarkable improvements in prompt-independent and grammar-related traits. Furthermore, GAPS achieves notable QWK gains in the most challenging cross-prompt scenario, highlighting its strength in evaluating unseen prompts.</description>

      <title>mmE5: Improving Multimodal Multilingual Embeddings via High-quality Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have gained significant attention for their ability to map data from different modalities, such as text and images, into a unified representation space. However, the limited labeled multimodal data often hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data synthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a critical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality synthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data covers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream scenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities semantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data maintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these principles, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks, modality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking process within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3) incorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring fidelity through self-evaluation and refinement. Leveraging these high-quality synthetic and labeled datasets, we train a multimodal multilingual E5 model mmE5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB Benchmark and superior multilingual performance on the XTD benchmark. Our codes, datasets and models are released in https://github.com/haon-chen/mmE5.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Restoration of Pruned Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although network pruning has been highly popularized to compress deep neural networks, its resulting accuracy heavily depends on a fine-tuning process that is often computationally expensive and requires the original data. However, this may not be the case in real-world scenarios, and hence a few recent works attempt to restore pruned networks without any expensive retraining process. Their strong assumption is that every neuron being pruned can be replaced with another one quite similar to it, but unfortunately this does not hold in many neural networks, where the similarity between neurons is extremely low in some layers. In this article, we propose a more rigorous and robust method of restoring pruned networks in a fine-tuning free and data-free manner, called LBYL (Leave Before You Leave). LBYL significantly relaxes the aforementioned assumption in a way that each pruned neuron leaves its pieces of information to as many preserved neurons as possible and thereby multiple neurons together obtain a more robust approximation to the original output of the neuron who just left. Our method is based on a theoretical analysis on how to formulate the reconstruction error between the original network and its approximation, which nicely leads to a closed form solution for our derived loss function. Through the extensive experiments, LBYL is confirmed to be indeed more effective to approximate the original network and consequently able to achieve higher accuracy for restored networks, compared to the recent approaches exploiting the similarity between two neurons. The very first version of this work, which contains major technical and theoretical components, was submitted to NeurIPS 2021 and ICML 2022.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Auto-regressive Chain-of-Thought through Loop-Aligned Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing language model's reasoning capabilities. However, generating long and correct CoT trajectories is challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Looped Transformers possess remarkable length generalization capabilities, but their limited generality and adaptability prevent them from serving as an alternative to auto-regressive solutions. To better leverage the strengths of Looped Transformers, we propose RELAY (REasoning through Loop Alignment iterativelY). Specifically, we align the steps of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with loop iterations and apply intermediate supervision during the training of Looped Transformers. This additional iteration-wise supervision not only preserves the Looped Transformer's ability for length generalization but also enables it to predict CoT reasoning steps for unseen data. Therefore, we leverage this Looped Transformer to generate accurate reasoning chains for complex problems that exceed the training length, which will then be used to fine-tune an auto-regressive model. We conduct extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with significant improvements in the performance of the auto-regressive model. Code will be released at https://github.com/qifanyu/RELAY.</description>

      <title>Measuring Diversity in Synthetic Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely adopted to generate synthetic datasets for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification and summarization. However, accurately measuring the diversity of these synthetic datasets-an aspect crucial for robust model performance-remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce DCScore, a novel method for measuring synthetic dataset diversity from a classification perspective. Specifically, DCScore formulates diversity evaluation as a sample classification task, leveraging mutual relationships among samples. We further provide theoretical verification of the diversity-related axioms satisfied by DCScore, highlighting its role as a principled diversity evaluation method. Experimental results on synthetic datasets reveal that DCScore enjoys a stronger correlation with multiple diversity pseudo-truths of evaluated datasets, underscoring its effectiveness. Moreover, both empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrate that DCScore substantially reduces computational costs compared to existing approaches.

      <title>FedMHO: Heterogeneous One-Shot Federated Learning Towards Resource-Constrained Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in edge computing scenarios, where a large number of heterogeneous clients operate under constrained or sufficient resources. The iterative training process in conventional FL introduces significant computation and communication overhead, which is unfriendly for resource-constrained edge devices. One-shot FL has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate communication overhead, and model-heterogeneous FL solves the problem of diverse computing resources across clients. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively managing model-heterogeneous one-shot FL, often leading to unsatisfactory global model performance or reliance on auxiliary datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FL framework named FedMHO, which leverages deep classification models on resource-sufficient clients and lightweight generative models on resource-constrained devices. On the server side, FedMHO involves a two-stage process that includes data generation and knowledge fusion. Furthermore, we introduce FedMHO-MD and FedMHO-SD to mitigate the knowledge-forgetting problem during the knowledge fusion stage, and an unsupervised data optimization solution to improve the quality of synthetic samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, as they outperform state-of-the-art baselines in various experimental setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework of neural networks for isotropic hyperelasticity that enforces necessary physical and mathematical constraints while simultaneously satisfying the universal approximation theorem. The two key ingredients are an input convex network architecture and a formulation in the elementary polynomials of the signed singular values of the deformation gradient. In line with previously published networks, it can rigorously capture frame-indifference and polyconvexity - as well as further constraints like balance of angular momentum and growth conditions. However and in contrast to previous networks, a universal approximation theorem for the proposed approach is proven. To be more explicit, the proposed network can approximate any frame-indifferent, isotropic polyconvex energy (provided the network is large enough). This is possible by working with a sufficient and necessary criterion for frame-indifferent, isotropic polyconvex functions. Comparative studies with existing approaches identify the advantages of the proposed method, particularly in approximating non-polyconvex energies as well as computing polyconvex hulls.</description>

      <title>LLMs can implicitly learn from mistakes in-context</title>

Abstract: Learning from mistakes is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. Previous work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can also learn from incorrect answers when provided with a comprehensive rationale detailing why an answer is wrong or how to correct it. In this work, we examine whether LLMs can learn from mistakes in mathematical reasoning tasks when these explanations are not provided. We investigate if LLMs are able to implicitly infer such rationales simply from observing both incorrect and correct answers. Surprisingly, we find that LLMs perform better, on average, when rationales are eliminated from the context and incorrect answers are simply shown alongside correct ones. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. We show that these results are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. Further, we carry out an in-depth analysis, and show that prompting with both wrong and correct answers leads to greater performance and better generalisation than introducing additional, more diverse question-answer pairs into the context. Finally, we show that new rationales generated by models that have only observed incorrect and correct answers are scored equally as highly by humans as those produced with the aid of exemplar rationales. Our results demonstrate that LLMs are indeed capable of in-context implicit learning.</description>

      <title>Fostering Appropriate Reliance on Large Language Models: The Role of Explanations, Sources, and Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can produce erroneous responses that sound fluent and convincing, raising the risk that users will rely on these responses as if they were correct. Mitigating such overreliance is a key challenge. Through a think-aloud study in which participants use an LLM-infused application to answer objective questions, we identify several features of LLM responses that shape users' reliance: explanations (supporting details for answers), inconsistencies in explanations, and sources. Through a large-scale, pre-registered, controlled experiment (N=308), we isolate and study the effects of these features on users' reliance, accuracy, and other measures. We find that the presence of explanations increases reliance on both correct and incorrect responses. However, we observe less reliance on incorrect responses when sources are provided or when explanations exhibit inconsistencies. We discuss the implications of these findings for fostering appropriate reliance on LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human understanding and generation are critical for modeling digital humans and humanoid embodiments. Recently, Human-centric Foundation Models (HcFMs) inspired by the success of generalist models, such as large language and vision models, have emerged to unify diverse human-centric tasks into a single framework, surpassing traditional task-specific approaches. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of HcFMs by proposing a taxonomy that categorizes current approaches into four groups: (1) Human-centric Perception Foundation Models that capture fine-grained features for multi-modal 2D and 3D understanding. (2) Human-centric AIGC Foundation Models that generate high-fidelity, diverse human-related content. (3) Unified Perception and Generation Models that integrate these capabilities to enhance both human understanding and synthesis. (4) Human-centric Agentic Foundation Models that extend beyond perception and generation to learn human-like intelligence and interactive behaviors for humanoid embodied tasks. We review state-of-the-art techniques, discuss emerging challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners working towards more robust, versatile, and intelligent digital human and embodiments modeling.</description>

      <title>Brain Latent Progression: Individual-based Spatiotemporal Disease Progression on 3D Brain MRIs via Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing availability of longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets has facilitated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modeling of disease progression, making it possible to predict future medical scans for individual patients. However, despite significant advancements in AI, current methods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific individualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing longitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To address these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel spatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression in 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates in a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata to enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior knowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the integration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average Stabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in the predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a measure of the uncertainty for the prediction. We train and evaluate BrLP on 11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its generalizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962 subjects. Our experiments compare BrLP-generated MRI scans with real follow-up MRIs, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing methods.

      <title>A Novel Approach to for Multimodal Emotion Recognition : Multimodal semantic information fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies, multimodal emotion recognition has become a prominent research topic. However, existing methods face challenges such as heterogeneous data fusion and the effective utilization of modality correlations. This paper proposes a novel multimodal emotion recognition approach, DeepMSI-MER, based on the integration of contrastive learning and visual sequence compression. The proposed method enhances cross-modal feature fusion through contrastive learning and reduces redundancy in the visual modality by leveraging visual sequence compression. Experimental results on two public datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate that DeepMSI-MER significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition, validating the effectiveness of multimodal feature fusion and the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Causal Operator with Adaptive Solver Transformer (COAST), a novel neural operator learning method that leverages a causal language model (CLM) framework to dynamically adapt time steps. Our method predicts both the evolution of a system and its optimal time step, intelligently balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. We find that COAST generates variable step sizes that correlate with the underlying system intrinsicities, both within and across dynamical systems. Within a single trajectory, smaller steps are taken in regions of high complexity, while larger steps are employed in simpler regions. Across different systems, more complex dynamics receive more granular time steps. Benchmarked on diverse systems with varied dynamics, COAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both efficiency and accuracy. This work underscores the potential of CLM-based intelligent adaptive solvers for scalable operator learning of dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models such as LLMs, GPTs, and Diffusion Models have recently gained widespread attention from both the research and the industrial communities. This survey explores their application in network monitoring and management, focusing on prominent use cases, as well as challenges and opportunities. We discuss how network traffic generation and classification, network intrusion detection, networked system log analysis, and network digital assistance can benefit from the use of GenAI models. Additionally, we provide an overview of the available GenAI models, datasets for large-scale training phases, and platforms for the development of such models. Finally, we discuss research directions that potentially mitigate the roadblocks to the adoption of GenAI for network monitoring and management. Our investigation aims to map the current landscape and pave the way for future research in leveraging GenAI for network monitoring and management.</description>

      <title>FBFL: A Field-Based Coordination Approach for Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last years, Federated learning (FL) has become a popular solution to train machine learning models in domains with high privacy concerns. However, FL scalability and performance face significant challenges in real-world deployments where data across devices are non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID). The heterogeneity in data distribution frequently arises from spatial distribution of devices, leading to degraded model performance in the absence of proper handling. Additionally, FL typical reliance on centralized architectures introduces bottlenecks and single-point-of-failure risks, particularly problematic at scale or in dynamic environments. To close this gap, we propose Field-Based Federated Learning (FBFL), a novel approach leveraging macroprogramming and field coordination to address these limitations through: (i) distributed spatial-based leader election for personalization to mitigate non-IID data challenges; and (ii) construction of a self-organizing, hierarchical architecture using advanced macroprogramming patterns. Moreover, FBFL not only overcomes the aforementioned limitations, but also enables the development of more specialized models tailored to the specific data distribution in each subregion. This paper formalizes FBFL and evaluates it extensively using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Extended MNIST datasets. We demonstrate that, when operating under IID data conditions, FBFL performs comparably to the widely-used FedAvg algorithm. Furthermore, in challenging non-IID scenarios, FBFL not only outperforms FedAvg but also surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, namely FedProx and Scaffold, which have been specifically designed to address non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we showcase the resilience of FBFL's self-organizing hierarchical architecture against server failures.</description>

      <title>Commercial LLM Agents Are Already Vulnerable to Simple Yet Dangerous Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high volume of recent ML security literature focuses on attacks against aligned large language models (LLMs). These attacks may extract private information or coerce the model into producing harmful outputs. In real-world deployments, LLMs are often part of a larger agentic pipeline including memory systems, retrieval, web access, and API calling. Such additional components introduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to attack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security of LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities that are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks categorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability, attack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines. We then conduct a series of illustrative attacks on popular open-source and commercial agents, demonstrating the immediate practical implications of their vulnerabilities. Notably, our attacks are trivial to implement and require no understanding of machine learning.</description>

      <title>Learning in Markets with Heterogeneous Agents: Dynamics and Survival of Bayesian vs. No-Regret Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of heterogeneous learning agents in asset markets with stochastic payoffs. Our agents aim to maximize the expected growth rate of their wealth but have different theories on how to learn this best. We focus on comparing Bayesian and no-regret learners in market dynamics. Bayesian learners with a prior over a finite set of models that assign positive prior probability to the correct model have posterior probabilities that converge exponentially to the correct model. Consequently, they survive even in the presence of agents who invest according to the correct model of the stochastic process. Bayesians with a continuum prior converge to the correct model at a rate of $O((\log T)/T)$. Online learning theory provides no-regret algorithms for maximizing the log of wealth in this setting, achieving a worst-case regret bound of $O(\log T)$ without assuming a steady underlying stochastic process but comparing to the best fixed investment rule. This regret, as we observe, is of the same order of magnitude as that of a Bayesian learner with a continuum prior. However, we show that even such low regret may not be sufficient for survival in asset markets: an agent can have regret as low as $O(\log T)$, but still vanish in market dynamics when competing against agents who invest according to the correct model or even against a perfect Bayesian with a finite prior. On the other hand, we show that Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret learning requires less knowledge of the environment and is therefore more robust. Any no-regret learner will drive out of the market an imperfect Bayesian whose finite prior or update rule has even small errors. We formally establish the relationship between notions of survival, vanishing, and market domination studied in economics and the framework of regret minimization, thus bridging these theories.</description>

      <title>CurvGAD: Leveraging Curvature for Enhanced Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Does the intrinsic curvature of complex networks hold the key to unveiling graph anomalies that conventional approaches overlook? Reconstruction-based graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods overlook such geometric outliers, focusing only on structural and attribute-level anomalies. To this end, we propose CurvGAD - a mixed-curvature graph autoencoder that introduces the notion of curvature-based geometric anomalies. CurvGAD introduces two parallel pipelines for enhanced anomaly interpretability: (1) Curvature-equivariant geometry reconstruction, which focuses exclusively on reconstructing the edge curvatures using a mixed-curvature, Riemannian encoder and Gaussian kernel-based decoder; and (2) Curvature-invariant structure and attribute reconstruction, which decouples structural and attribute anomalies from geometric irregularities by regularizing graph curvature under discrete Ollivier-Ricci flow, thereby isolating the non-geometric anomalies. By leveraging curvature, CurvGAD refines the existing anomaly classifications and identifies new curvature-driven anomalies. Extensive experimentation over 10 real-world datasets (both homophilic and heterophilic) demonstrates an improvement of up to 6.5% over state-of-the-art GAD methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings reduce the risks associated with using distillation at scale; compute allocation for both the teacher and student models can now be done to maximize student performance. We provide compute optimal distillation recipes for when 1) a teacher exists, or 2) a teacher needs training. If many students are to be distilled, or a teacher already exists, distillation outperforms supervised pretraining until a compute level which grows predictably with student size. If one student is to be distilled and a teacher also needs training, supervised learning should be done instead. Additionally, we provide insights across our large scale study of distillation, which increase our understanding of distillation and inform experimental design.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Security Vulnerabilities: A Metric-Driven Security Analysis of Gaps in Current AI Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems integrate into critical infrastructure, security gaps in AI compliance frameworks demand urgent attention. This paper audits and quantifies security risks in three major AI governance standards: NIST AI RMF 1.0, UK's AI and Data Protection Risk Toolkit, and the EU's ALTAI. Using a novel risk assessment methodology, we develop four key metrics: Risk Severity Index (RSI), Attack Potential Index (AVPI), Compliance-Security Gap Percentage (CSGP), and Root Cause Vulnerability Score (RCVS). Our analysis identifies 136 concerns across the frameworks, exposing significant gaps. NIST fails to address 69.23 percent of identified risks, ALTAI has the highest attack vector vulnerability (AVPI = 0.51) and the ICO Toolkit has the largest compliance-security gap, with 80.00 percent of high-risk concerns remaining unresolved. Root cause analysis highlights under-defined processes (ALTAI RCVS = 033) and weak implementation guidance (NIST and ICO RCVS = 0.25) as critical weaknesses. These findings emphasize the need for stronger, enforceable security controls in AI compliance. We offer targeted recommendations to enhance security posture and bridge the gap between compliance and real-world AI risks.</description>

      <title>Randomness of Low-Layer Parameters Determines Confusing Samples in Terms of Interaction Representations of a DNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find that the complexity of interactions encoded by a deep neural network (DNN) can explain its generalization power. We also discover that the confusing samples of a DNN, which are represented by non-generalizable interactions, are determined by its low-layer parameters. In comparison, other factors, such as high-layer parameters and network architecture, have much less impact on the composition of confusing samples. Two DNNs with different low-layer parameters usually have fully different sets of confusing samples, even though they have similar performance. This finding extends the understanding of the lottery ticket hypothesis, and well explains distinctive representation power of different DNNs.</description>

      <title>Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AIs rapidly advance and become more agentic, the risk they pose is governed not only by their capabilities but increasingly by their propensities, including goals and values. Tracking the emergence of goals and values has proven a longstanding problem, and despite much interest over the years it remains unclear whether current AIs have meaningful values. We propose a solution to this problem, leveraging the framework of utility functions to study the internal coherence of AI preferences. Surprisingly, we find that independently-sampled preferences in current LLMs exhibit high degrees of structural coherence, and moreover that this emerges with scale. These findings suggest that value systems emerge in LLMs in a meaningful sense, a finding with broad implications. To study these emergent value systems, we propose utility engineering as a research agenda, comprising both the analysis and control of AI utilities. We uncover problematic and often shocking values in LLM assistants despite existing control measures. These include cases where AIs value themselves over humans and are anti-aligned with specific individuals. To constrain these emergent value systems, we propose methods of utility control. As a case study, we show how aligning utilities with a citizen assembly reduces political biases and generalizes to new scenarios. Whether we like it or not, value systems have already emerged in AIs, and much work remains to fully understand and control these emergent representations.</description>

      <title>A Real-to-Sim-to-Real Approach to Robotic Manipulation with VLM-Generated Iterative Keypoint Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task specification for robotic manipulation in open-world environments is challenging, requiring flexible and adaptive objectives that align with human intentions and can evolve through iterative feedback. We introduce Iterative Keypoint Reward (IKER), a visually grounded, Python-based reward function that serves as a dynamic task specification. Our framework leverages VLMs to generate and refine these reward functions for multi-step manipulation tasks. Given RGB-D observations and free-form language instructions, we sample keypoints in the scene and generate a reward function conditioned on these keypoints. IKER operates on the spatial relationships between keypoints, leveraging commonsense priors about the desired behaviors, and enabling precise SE(3) control. We reconstruct real-world scenes in simulation and use the generated rewards to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are then deployed into the real world-forming a real-to-sim-to-real loop. Our approach demonstrates notable capabilities across diverse scenarios, including both prehensile and non-prehensile tasks, showcasing multi-step task execution, spontaneous error recovery, and on-the-fly strategy adjustments. The results highlight IKER's effectiveness in enabling robots to perform multi-step tasks in dynamic environments through iterative reward shaping.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>

      <title>Towards CausalGPT: A Multi-Agent Approach for Faithful Knowledge Reasoning via Promoting Causal Consistency in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the progress of foundation models, knowledge-based reasoning remains a persistent challenge due to their limited capacity for knowledge recall and inference. Existing methods primarily focus on encouraging these models to plan and solve problems or extensively sample reasoning chains independently. However, these methods often overlook conceptual errors and inferential fallacies, inevitably leading to a series of notorious issues such as misleading conclusions, cognitive biases, and reduced decision quality. While explicit modeling of causality is argued to hold promise in addressing these issues, contemporary research efforts have thus far fallen short in achieving causality-based foundation models. Drawing inspiration from the orchestration of diverse specialized agents collaborating to tackle intricate tasks, we propose a framework named Causal-Consistency Chain-of-Thought (CaCo-CoT) that harnesses multi-agent collaboration to bolster the faithfulness and causality of foundation models, involving a set of reasoners and evaluators. These agents collaboratively work within a reasoning-and-consensus paradigm to improve faithfulness. The reasoners are tasked with generating reasoning chains for knowledge-intensive problems by mimicking human causal reasoning. Meanwhile, the evaluator scrutinizes the causal consistency of a reasoner's reasoning chain from a non-causal and a counterfactual perspective. Our framework demonstrates significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods through extensive and comprehensive evaluations across text-based and multi-modal knowledge reasoning tasks (e.g., science question answering and commonsense reasoning).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes MAIA, a Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent. MAIA is a system that uses neural models to automate neural model understanding tasks like feature interpretation and failure mode discovery. It equips a pre-trained vision-language model with a set of tools that support iterative experimentation on subcomponents of other models to explain their behavior. These include tools commonly used by human interpretability researchers: for synthesizing and editing inputs, computing maximally activating exemplars from real-world datasets, and summarizing and describing experimental results. Interpretability experiments proposed by MAIA compose these tools to describe and explain system behavior. We evaluate applications of MAIA to computer vision models. We first characterize MAIA's ability to describe (neuron-level) features in learned representations of images. Across several trained models and a novel dataset of synthetic vision neurons with paired ground-truth descriptions, MAIA produces descriptions comparable to those generated by expert human experimenters. We then show that MAIA can aid in two additional interpretability tasks: reducing sensitivity to spurious features, and automatically identifying inputs likely to be mis-classified.</description>

      <title>Metaheuristics and Large Language Models Join Forces: Toward an Integrated Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) a couple of years ago, researchers in metaheuristics (MHs) have wondered how to use their power in a beneficial way within their algorithms. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages LLMs as pattern recognition tools to improve MHs. The resulting hybrid method, tested in the context of a social network-based combinatorial optimization problem, outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches that combine machine learning with MHs regarding the obtained solution quality. By carefully designing prompts, we demonstrate that the output obtained from LLMs can be used as problem knowledge, leading to improved results. Lastly, we acknowledge LLMs' potential drawbacks and limitations and consider it essential to examine them to advance this type of research further. Our method can be reproduced using a tool available at: https://github.com/camilochs/optipattern.</description>

      <title>FAIIR: Building Toward A Conversational AI Agent Assistant for Youth Mental Health Service Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The world's healthcare systems and mental health agencies face both a growing demand for youth mental health services, alongside a simultaneous challenge of limited resources. Here, we focus on frontline crisis support, where Crisis Responders (CRs) engage in conversations for youth mental health support and assign an issue tag to each conversation. In this study, we develop FAIIR (Frontline Assistant: Issue Identification and Recommendation), an advanced tool leveraging an ensemble of domain-adapted and fine-tuned transformer models trained on a large conversational dataset comprising 780,000 conversations. The primary aim is to reduce the cognitive burden on CRs, enhance the accuracy of issue identification, and streamline post-conversation administrative tasks. We evaluate FAIIR on both retrospective and prospective conversations, emphasizing human-in-the-loop design with active CR engagement for model refinement, consensus-building, and overall assessment. Our results indicate that FAIIR achieves an average AUCROC of 94%, a sample average F1-score of 64%, and a sample average recall score of 81% on the retrospective test set. We also demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the FAIIR tool during the silent testing phase, with less than a 2% drop in all performance metrics. Notably, CRs' responses exhibited an overall agreement of 90.9% with FAIIR's predictions. Furthermore, expert agreement with FAIIR surpassed their agreement with the original labels. To conclude, our findings indicate that assisting with the identification of issues of relevance helps reduce the burden on CRs, ensuring that appropriate resources can be provided and that active rescues and mandatory reporting can take place in critical situations requiring immediate de-escalation.</description>

      <title>Logicbreaks: A Framework for Understanding Subversion of Rule-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how to subvert large language models (LLMs) from following prompt-specified rules. We first formalize rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Next, we prove that although small transformers can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can still mislead both theoretical constructions and models learned from data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular attack algorithms on LLMs find adversarial prompts and induce attention patterns that align with our theory. Our novel logic-based framework provides a foundation for studying LLMs in rule-based settings, enabling a formal analysis of tasks like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>ELASTIC: Efficient Linear Attention for Sequential Interest Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art sequential recommendation models heavily rely on transformer's attention mechanism. However, the quadratic computational and memory complexities of self attention have limited its scalability for modeling users' long range behaviour sequences. To address this problem, we propose ELASTIC, an Efficient Linear Attention for SequenTial Interest Compression, requiring only linear time complexity and decoupling model capacity from computational cost. Specifically, ELASTIC introduces a fixed length interest experts with linear dispatcher attention mechanism which compresses the long-term behaviour sequences to a significantly more compact representation which reduces up to 90% GPU memory usage with x2.7 inference speed up. The proposed linear dispatcher attention mechanism significantly reduces the quadratic complexity and makes the model feasible for adequately modeling extremely long sequences. Moreover, in order to retain the capacity for modeling various user interests, ELASTIC initializes a vast learnable interest memory bank and sparsely retrieves compressed user's interests from the memory with a negligible computational overhead. The proposed interest memory retrieval technique significantly expands the cardinality of available interest space while keeping the same computational cost, thereby striking a trade-off between recommendation accuracy and efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed ELASTIC, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets and compare it with several strong sequential recommenders. Experimental results demonstrate that ELASTIC consistently outperforms baselines by a significant margin and also highlight the computational efficiency of ELASTIC when modeling long sequences. We will make our implementation code publicly available.</description>

      <title>A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.</description>

      <title>U-shaped and Inverted-U Scaling behind Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit emergent abilities in some downstream tasks, where model performance stagnates at first and then improves sharply and unpredictably with scale beyond a threshold. In this work, we investigate the phenomenon by grouping questions based on difficulty level and provide a possible explanation for emergent abilities. Specifically, we observe U-shaped scaling for hard questions and inverted-U scaling followed by steady improvement for easy questions. The two scaling patterns initially offset each other, causing stagnant overall performance. The performance starts to soar when the scaling pattern of easy questions reverts from inverse to standard scaling, leading to emergent abilities. Based on this finding, we propose a simple yet effective pipeline, called Slice-and-Sandwich, to predict the emergence threshold and model performance beyond the threshold. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tony10101105/ExpEmergence.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel mobile phone control architecture, Lightweight Multi-modal App Control (LiMAC), for efficient interactions and control across various Android apps. LiMAC takes as input a textual goal and a sequence of past mobile observations, such as screenshots and corresponding UI trees, to generate precise actions. To address the computational constraints inherent to smartphones, we introduce a small Action Transformer (AcT) integrated with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) for real-time decision-making and task execution. We evaluate LiMAC on two open-source mobile control datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our small-form-factor approach against fine-tuned versions of open-source VLMs, such as Florence2 and Qwen2-VL. It also significantly outperforms prompt engineering baselines utilising closed-source foundation models like GPT-4o. More specifically, LiMAC increases the overall action accuracy by up to 19% compared to fine-tuned VLMs, and up to 42% compared to prompt-engineering baselines.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Training of Diffusion Models for Feasible Solution Generation in Neural Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising results in generating near-optimal solutions without the need for expert-crafted heuristics. However, high performance of these approaches often rely on problem-specific human-expertise-based search after generating candidate solutions, limiting their applicability to commonly solved CO problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this paper, we present IC/DC, an unsupervised CO framework that directly trains a diffusion model from scratch. We train our model in a self-supervised way to minimize the cost of the solution while adhering to the problem-specific constraints. IC/DC is specialized in addressing CO problems involving two distinct sets of items, and it does not need problem-specific search processes to generate valid solutions. IC/DC employs a novel architecture capable of capturing the intricate relationships between items, and thereby enabling effective optimization in challenging CO scenarios. IC/DC achieves state-of-the-art performance relative to existing NCO methods on the Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (PMSP) and Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP).</description>

      <title>Bag of Tricks for Inference-time Computation of LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), solving complex reasoning tasks has gained increasing attention. Inference-time computation methods (e.g., Best-of-N, beam search, et al.) are particularly valuable as they can enhance reasoning performance without modifying model parameters or requiring additional training. However, these techniques come with implementation challenges, and most existing methods remain at the proof-of-concept stage with limited practical adoption due to their computational complexity and varying effectiveness across different tasks. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark diverse inference-time computation strategies across reasoning tasks of varying complexity. Since most current methods rely on a proposer-verifier pipeline that first generates candidate solutions (e.g., reasoning solutions) and then selects the best one based on reward signals (e.g., RLHF rewards, process rewards), our research focuses on optimizing both candidate solution generation (e.g., instructing prompts, hyperparameters such as temperature and top-p) and reward mechanisms (e.g., self-evaluation, reward types). Through extensive experiments (more than 20,000 A100-80G GPU hours with over 1,000 experiments) across a variety of models (e.g., Llama, Qwen, and Mistral families) of various sizes, our ablation studies reveal that previously overlooked strategies can significantly enhance performance (e.g., tuning temperature can improve reasoning task performance by up to 5%). Furthermore, we establish a standardized benchmark for inference-time computation by systematically evaluating six representative methods across eight reasoning tasks. These findings provide a stronger foundation for future research. The code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/benchmark_inference_time_computation_LL</description>

      <title>SymGPT: Auditing Smart Contracts via Combining Symbolic Execution with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To govern smart contracts running on Ethereum, multiple Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards have been developed, each having a set of rules to guide the behaviors of smart contracts. Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations. This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules. To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions. Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar. We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them. Our evaluation shows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world contracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing financial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, SymGPT outperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service, underscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.</description>

      <title>MAGELLAN: Metacognitive predictions of learning progress guide autotelic LLM agents in large goal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-ended learning agents must efficiently prioritize goals in vast possibility spaces, focusing on those that maximize learning progress (LP). When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive monitoring. Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on brittle expert-defined goal groupings. We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online. By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces through generalization. In an interactive learning environment, we show that MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space. These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to open-ended goal spaces.</description>

      <title>Variational Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, impulse responses, human faces) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to construct one's outcome under a counterfactual treatment, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its observed factual outcome on top of the covariates. We propose a deep variational Bayesian framework that rigorously integrates two main sources of information for outcome construction under a counterfactual treatment: one source is the individual features embedded in the high-dimensional factual outcome; the other source is the response distribution of similar subjects (subjects with the same covariates) that factually received this treatment of interest.</description>

      <title>Predicting Cellular Responses with Variational Causal Inference and Refined Relational Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the responses of a cell under perturbations may bring important benefits to drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. In this work, we propose a novel graph variational Bayesian causal inference framework to predict a cell's gene expressions under counterfactual perturbations (perturbations that this cell did not factually receive), leveraging information representing biological knowledge in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to aid individualized cellular response predictions. Aiming at a data-adaptive GRN, we also developed an adjacency matrix updating technique for graph convolutional networks and used it to refine GRNs during pre-training, which generated more insights on gene relations and enhanced model performance. Additionally, we propose a robust estimator within our framework for the asymptotically efficient estimation of marginal perturbation effect, which is yet to be carried out in previous works. With extensive experiments, we exhibited the advantage of our approach over state-of-the-art deep learning models for individual response prediction.</description>

      <title>Adapt then Unlearn: Exploring Parameter Space Semantics for Unlearning in Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Owing to the growing concerns about privacy and regulatory compliance, it is desirable to regulate the output of generative models. To that end, the objective of this work is to prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the underlying training data set is inaccessible. Our approach is inspired by the observation that the parameter space of GANs exhibits meaningful directions that can be leveraged to suppress specific undesired features. However, such directions usually result in the degradation of the quality of generated samples. Our proposed two-stage method, known as 'Adapt-then-Unlearn,' excels at unlearning such undesirable features while also maintaining the quality of generated samples. In the initial stage, we adapt a pre-trained GAN on a set of negative samples (containing undesired features) provided by the user. Subsequently, we train the original pre-trained GAN using positive samples, along with a repulsion regularizer. This regularizer encourages the learned model parameters to move away from the parameters of the adapted model (first stage) while not degrading the generation quality. We provide theoretical insights into the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, our approach stands as the first method addressing unlearning within the realm of high-fidelity GANs (such as StyleGAN). We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments, encompassing both class-level unlearning on the MNIST and AFHQ dataset and feature-level unlearning tasks on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Our code and implementation is available at: https://github.com/atriguha/Adapt_Unlearn.</description>

      <title>Robotic Grasping of Harvested Tomato Trusses Using Vision and Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, truss tomato weighing and packaging require significant manual work. The main obstacle to automation lies in the difficulty of developing a reliable robotic grasping system for already harvested trusses. We propose a method to grasp trusses that are stacked in a crate with considerable clutter, which is how they are commonly stored and transported after harvest. The method consists of a deep learning-based vision system to first identify the individual trusses in the crate and then determine a suitable grasping location on the stem. To this end, we have introduced a grasp pose ranking algorithm with online learning capabilities. After selecting the most promising grasp pose, the robot executes a pinch grasp without needing touch sensors or geometric models. Lab experiments with a robotic manipulator equipped with an eye-in-hand RGB-D camera showed a 100% clearance rate when tasked to pick all trusses from a pile. 93% of the trusses were successfully grasped on the first try, while the remaining 7% required more attempts.</description>

      <title>A Stability Principle for Learning under Non-Stationarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a versatile framework for statistical learning in non-stationary environments. In each time period, our approach applies a stability principle to select a look-back window that maximizes the utilization of historical data while keeping the cumulative bias within an acceptable range relative to the stochastic error. Our theory and numerical experiments showcase the adaptivity of this approach to unknown non-stationarity. We prove regret bounds that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors when the population losses are strongly convex, or Lipschitz only. At the heart of our analysis lie two novel components: a measure of similarity between functions and a segmentation technique for dividing the non-stationary data sequence into quasi-stationary pieces.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Persuasion Through Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18138v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a Bayesian persuasion game where a sender wants to persuade a receiver to take a binary action, such as purchasing a product. The sender is informed about the (real-valued) state of the world, such as the quality of the product, but only has limited information about the receiver's beliefs and utilities. Motivated by customer surveys, user studies, and recent advances in AI, we allow the sender to learn more about the receiver by querying an oracle that simulates the receiver's behavior. After a fixed number of queries, the sender commits to a messaging policy and the receiver takes the action that maximizes her expected utility given the message she receives. We characterize the sender's optimal messaging policy given any distribution over receiver types. We then design a polynomial-time querying algorithm that optimizes the sender's expected utility in this game. We also consider approximate oracles, more general query structures, and costly queries.</description>

Abstract: We consider the combinatorial volatile Gaussian process (GP) semi-bandit problem. Each round, an agent is provided a set of available base arms and must select a subset of them to maximize the long-term cumulative reward. We study the Bayesian setting and provide novel Bayesian cumulative regret bounds for three GP-based algorithms: GP-UCB, GP-BayesUCB and GP-TS. Our bounds extend previous results for GP-UCB and GP-TS to the infinite, volatile and combinatorial setting, and to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first regret bound for GP-BayesUCB. Volatile arms encompass other widely considered bandit problems such as contextual bandits. Furthermore, we employ our framework to address the challenging real-world problem of online energy-efficient navigation, where we demonstrate its effectiveness compared to the alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Missing values are ubiquitous in multivariate time series (MTS) data, posing significant challenges for accurate analysis and downstream applications. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have successfully handled missing data by leveraging complex temporal dependencies and learned data distributions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of deep learning approaches for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) tasks. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on two key perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Furthermore, we summarize existing MTSI toolkits with a particular emphasis on the PyPOTS Ecosystem, which provides an integrated and standardized foundation for MTSI research. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions, which give insight for further MTSI research. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of time series analysis and missing data imputation tasks.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models' success on text generation has also made them better at code generation and coding tasks. While a lot of work has demonstrated their remarkable performance on tasks such as code completion and editing, it is still unclear as to why. We help bridge this gap by exploring to what degree auto-regressive models understand the logical constructs of the underlying programs. We propose Counterfactual Analysis for Programming Concept Predicates (CACP) as a counterfactual testing framework to evaluate whether Large Code Models understand programming concepts. With only black-box access to the model, we use CACP to evaluate ten popular Large Code Models for four different programming concepts. Our findings suggest that current models lack understanding of concepts such as data flow and control flow.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Performance of ChatGPT for Spam Email Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Email continues to be a pivotal and extensively utilized communication medium within professional and commercial domains. Nonetheless, the prevalence of spam emails poses a significant challenge for users, disrupting their daily routines and diminishing productivity. Consequently, accurately identifying and filtering spam based on content has become crucial for cybersecurity. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in tasks such as question answering and text generation. However, its potential in spam identification remains underexplored. To fill in the gap, this study attempts to evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities for spam identification in both English and Chinese email datasets. We employ ChatGPT for spam email detection using in-context learning, which requires a prompt instruction with (or without) a few demonstrations. We also investigate how the number of demonstrations in the prompt affects the performance of ChatGPT. For comparison, we also implement five popular benchmark methods, including naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), feedforward dense neural networks (DNN), and BERT classifiers. Through extensive experiments, the performance of ChatGPT is significantly worse than deep supervised learning methods in the large English dataset, while it presents superior performance on the low-resourced Chinese dataset. This study provides insights into the potential and limitations of ChatGPT for spam identification, highlighting its potential as a viable solution for resource-constrained language domains.</description>

      <title>Personalized Negative Reservoir for Incremental Learning in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems have become an integral part of online platforms. Every day the volume of training data is expanding and the number of user interactions is constantly increasing. The exploration of larger and more expressive models has become a necessary pursuit to improve user experience. However, this progression carries with it an increased computational burden. In commercial settings, once a recommendation system model has been trained and deployed it typically needs to be updated frequently as new client data arrive. Cumulatively, the mounting volume of data is guaranteed to eventually make full batch retraining of the model from scratch computationally infeasible. Naively fine-tuning solely on the new data runs into the well-documented problem of catastrophic forgetting. Despite the fact that negative sampling is a crucial part of training with implicit feedback, no specialized technique exists that is tailored to the incremental learning framework. In this work, we propose a personalized negative reservoir strategy, which is used to obtain negative samples for the standard triplet loss of graph-based recommendation systems. Our technique balances alleviation of forgetting with plasticity by encouraging the model to remember stable user preferences and selectively forget when user interests change. We derive the mathematical formulation of a negative sampler to populate and update the reservoir. We integrate our design in three SOTA and commonly used incremental recommendation models. We show that these concrete realizations of our negative reservoir framework achieve state-of-the-art results for standard benchmarks using multiple top-k evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Predicting Parkinson's disease trajectory using clinical and functional MRI features: a reproduction and replication study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood physiopathology and no established biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages and for prediction of disease progression. Several neuroimaging biomarkers have been studied recently, but these are susceptible to several sources of variability related for instance to cohort selection or image analysis. In this context, an evaluation of the robustness of such biomarkers to variations in the data processing workflow is essential. This study is part of a larger project investigating the replicability of potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Here, we attempt to reproduce (re-implementing the experiments with the same data, same method) and replicate (different data and/or method) the models described in [1] to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We use the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in [1] and aim to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. Different criteria were used to evaluate the reproduction and compare the reproduced results with the original ones. Notably, we obtained significantly better than chance performance using the analysis pipeline closest to that in the original study (R2 \&amp;gt; 0), which is consistent with its findings. Moreover, using derived data provided by the authors of the original study, we were able to make an exact reproduction and managed to obtain results that were close to the original ones. The challenges encountered while reproducing and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to further facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future.</description>

      <title>The Journey to Trustworthy AI: Pursuit of Pragmatic Frameworks</title>

Abstract: This paper reviews Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) and its various definitions. Considering the principles respected in any society, TAI is often characterized by a few attributes, some of which have led to confusion in regulatory or engineering contexts. We argue against using terms such as Responsible or Ethical AI as substitutes for TAI. And to help clarify any confusion, we suggest leaving them behind. Given the subjectivity and complexity inherent in TAI, developing a universal framework is deemed infeasible. Instead, we advocate for approaches centered on addressing key attributes and properties such as fairness, bias, risk, security, explainability, and reliability. We examine the ongoing regulatory landscape, with a focus on initiatives in the EU, China, and the USA. We recognize that differences in AI regulations based on geopolitical and geographical reasons pose an additional challenge for multinational companies. We identify risk as a core factor in AI regulation and TAI. For example, as outlined in the EU-AI Act, organizations must gauge the risk level of their AI products to act accordingly (or risk hefty fines). We compare modalities of TAI implementation and how multiple cross-functional teams are engaged in the overall process. Thus, a brute force approach for enacting TAI renders its efficiency and agility, moot. To address this, we introduce our framework Set-Formalize-Measure-Act (SFMA). Our solution highlights the importance of transforming TAI-aware metrics, drivers of TAI, stakeholders, and business/legal requirements into actual benchmarks or tests. Finally, over-regulation driven by panic of powerful AI models can, in fact, harm TAI too. Based on GitHub user-activity data, in 2023, AI open-source projects rose to top projects by contributor account. Enabling innovation in TAI hinges on the independent contributions of the open-source community.</description>

      <title>How Sparse Attention Approximates Exact Attention? Your Attention is Naturally $n^C$-Sparse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Attention is a technique that approximates standard attention computation with sub-quadratic complexity. This is achieved by selectively ignoring smaller entries in the attention matrix during the softmax function computation. Variations of this technique, such as pruning KV cache, sparsity-based fast attention, and Sparse Transformer, have been extensively utilized for efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) deployment. Despite its widespread use, a theoretical understanding of the conditions under which sparse attention performs on par with traditional attention remains elusive. This work aims to $\textbf{bridge this gap by examining the inherent sparsity of standard attention processes}$. Our theoretical framework reveals several brand-new key insights:
  $\bullet$ Attention is $n^{C}$-sparse, implying that considering only the largest $\Omega(n^{C})$ entries out of all $n$ entries is sufficient for sparse attention to approximate the exact attention matrix with decreasing loss. Here, $n$ represents the input length and $C \in (0, 1)$ is a constant.
  $\bullet$ Stable $o(\log(n))$-sparse attention, which approximates attention computation with $\log(n)$ or fewer entries, may not be feasible since the error will persist at a minimum of $O(1)$.
  $\bullet$ An adaptive strategy ($\alpha \cdot n^C, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$) for the window size of efficient attention methods rather than a fixed one is guaranteed to perform more accurately and efficiently in a task for inference on flexible context lengths.</description>

      <title>Truthful Aggregation of LLMs with an Application to Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05905v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next frontier of online advertising is revenue generation from LLM-generated content. We consider a setting where advertisers aim to influence the responses of an LLM to align with their interests, while platforms seek to maximize advertiser value and ensure user satisfaction. The challenge is that advertisers' preferences generally conflict with those of the user, and advertisers may misreport their preferences. To address this, we introduce MOSAIC, an auction mechanism that ensures that truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for advertisers and that aligns the utility of each advertiser with their contribution to social welfare. Importantly, the mechanism operates without LLM fine-tuning or access to model weights and provably converges to the output of the optimally fine-tuned LLM as computational resources increase. Additionally, it can incorporate contextual information about advertisers, which significantly improves social welfare. Through experiments with a publicly available LLM, we show that MOSAIC leads to high advertiser value and platform revenue with low computational overhead. While our motivating application is online advertising, our mechanism can be applied in any setting with monetary transfers, making it a general-purpose solution for truthfully aggregating the preferences of self-interested agents over LLM-generated replies.</description>

      <title>Trivialized Momentum Facilitates Diffusion Generative Modeling on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generative modeling of data on manifolds is an important task, for which diffusion models in flat spaces typically need nontrivial adaptations. This article demonstrates how a technique called `trivialization' can transfer the effectiveness of diffusion models in Euclidean spaces to Lie groups. In particular, an auxiliary momentum variable was algorithmically introduced to help transport the position variable between data distribution and a fixed, easy-to-sample distribution. Normally, this would incur further difficulty for manifold data because momentum lives in a space that changes with the position. However, our trivialization technique creates a new momentum variable that stays in a simple fixed vector space. This design, together with a manifold preserving integrator, simplifies implementation and avoids inaccuracies created by approximations such as projections to tangent space and manifold, which were typically used in prior work, hence facilitating generation with high-fidelity and efficiency. The resulting method achieves state-of-the-art performance on protein and RNA torsion angle generation and sophisticated torus datasets. We also, arguably for the first time, tackle the generation of data on high-dimensional Special Orthogonal and Unitary groups, the latter essential for quantum problems.

      <title>Robot Instance Segmentation with Few Annotations for Grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of robots to manipulate objects relies heavily on their aptitude for visual perception. In domains characterized by cluttered scenes and high object variability, most methods call for vast labeled datasets, laboriously hand-annotated, with the aim of training capable models. Once deployed, the challenge of generalizing to unfamiliar objects implies that the model must evolve alongside its domain. To address this, we propose a novel framework that combines Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Learning Through Interaction (LTI), allowing a model to learn by observing scene alterations and leverage visual consistency despite temporal gaps without requiring curated data of interaction sequences. As a result, our approach exploits partially annotated data through self-supervision and incorporates temporal context using pseudo-sequences generated from unlabeled still images. We validate our method on two common benchmarks, ARMBench mix-object-tote and OCID, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on ARMBench, we attain an $\text{AP}_{50}$ of $86.37$, almost a $20\%$ improvement over existing work, and obtain remarkable results in scenarios with extremely low annotation, achieving an $\text{AP}_{50}$ score of $84.89$ with just $1 \%$ of annotated data compared to $72$ presented in ARMBench on the fully annotated counterpart.</description>

      <title>Tackling Data Corruption in Offline Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning policy from offline datasets through offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for scaling data-driven decision-making while avoiding unsafe and costly online interactions. However, real-world data collected from sensors or humans often contains noise and errors, posing a significant challenge for existing offline RL methods, particularly when the real-world data is limited. Our study reveals that prior research focusing on adapting predominant offline RL methods based on temporal difference learning still falls short under data corruption when the dataset is limited. In contrast, we discover that vanilla sequence modeling methods, such as Decision Transformer, exhibit robustness against data corruption, even without specialized modifications. To unlock the full potential of sequence modeling, we propose Robust Decision Rransformer (RDT) by incorporating three simple yet effective robust techniques: embedding dropout to improve the model's robustness against erroneous inputs, Gaussian weighted learning to mitigate the effects of corrupted labels, and iterative data correction to eliminate corrupted data from the source. Extensive experiments on MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit tasks demonstrate RDT's superior performance under various data corruption scenarios compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RDT exhibits remarkable robustness in a more challenging setting that combines training-time data corruption with test-time observation perturbations. These results highlight the potential of sequence modeling for learning from noisy or corrupted offline datasets, thereby promoting the reliable application of offline RL in real-world scenarios.

      <title>Confidence-based Estimators for Predictive Performance in Model Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After a machine learning model has been deployed into production, its predictive performance needs to be monitored. Ideally, such monitoring can be carried out by comparing the model's predictions against ground truth labels. For this to be possible, the ground truth labels must be available relatively soon after inference. However, there are many use cases where ground truth labels are available only after a significant delay, or in the worst case, not at all. In such cases, directly monitoring the model's predictive performance is impossible.
  Recently, novel methods for estimating the predictive performance of a model when ground truth is unavailable have been developed. Many of these methods leverage model confidence or other uncertainty estimates and are experimentally compared against a naive baseline method, namely Average Confidence (AC), which estimates model accuracy as the average of confidence scores for a given set of predictions. However, until now the theoretical properties of the AC method have not been properly explored. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by reviewing the AC method and show that under certain general assumptions, it is an unbiased and consistent estimator of model accuracy with many desirable properties. We also compare this baseline estimator against some more complex estimators empirically and show that in many cases the AC method is able to beat the others, although the comparative quality of the different estimators is heavily case-dependent.</description>

      <title>AdapTable: Test-Time Adaptation for Tabular Data via Shift-Aware Uncertainty Calibrator and Label Distribution Handler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, tabular data often suffer from distribution shifts that threaten the performance of machine learning models. Despite its prevalence and importance, handling distribution shifts in the tabular domain remains underexplored due to the inherent challenges within the tabular data itself. In this sense, test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by adapting models to target data without accessing source data, crucial for privacy-sensitive tabular domains. However, existing TTA methods either 1) overlook the nature of tabular distribution shifts, often involving label distribution shifts, or 2) impose architectural constraints on the model, leading to a lack of applicability. To this end, we propose AdapTable, a novel TTA framework for tabular data. AdapTable operates in two stages: 1) calibrating model predictions using a shift-aware uncertainty calibrator, and 2) adjusting these predictions to match the target label distribution with a label distribution handler. We validate the effectiveness of AdapTable through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on various distribution shift scenarios. Our results demonstrate AdapTable's ability to handle various real-world distribution shifts, achieving up to a 16% improvement on the HELOC dataset.</description>

      <title>Representing Rule-based Chatbots with Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What kind of internal mechanisms might Transformers use to conduct fluid, natural-sounding conversations? Prior work has illustrated by construction how Transformers can solve various synthetic tasks, such as sorting a list or recognizing formal languages, but it remains unclear how to extend this approach to a conversational setting. In this work, we propose using ELIZA, a classic rule-based chatbot, as a setting for formal, mechanistic analysis of Transformer-based chatbots. ELIZA allows us to formally model key aspects of conversation, including local pattern matching and long-term dialogue state tracking. We first present a theoretical construction of a Transformer that implements the ELIZA chatbot. Building on prior constructions, particularly those for simulating finite-state automata, we show how simpler mechanisms can be composed and extended to produce more sophisticated behavior. Next, we conduct a set of empirical analyses of Transformers trained on synthetically generated ELIZA conversations. Our analysis illustrates the kinds of mechanisms these models tend to prefer--for example, models favor an induction head mechanism over a more precise, position-based copying mechanism; and using intermediate generations to simulate recurrent data structures, akin to an implicit scratchpad or Chain-of-Thought. Overall, by drawing an explicit connection between neural chatbots and interpretable, symbolic mechanisms, our results provide a new framework for the mechanistic analysis of conversational agents.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Robust Cross-Lingual Entity Alignment via Neighbor Triple Matching with Entity and Relation Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15588v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual entity alignment (EA) enables the integration of multiple knowledge graphs (KGs) across different languages, providing users with seamless access to diverse and comprehensive knowledge. Existing methods, mostly supervised, face challenges in obtaining labeled entity pairs. To address this, recent studies have shifted towards self-supervised and unsupervised frameworks. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches have limitations: (1) Relation passing: mainly focusing on the entity while neglecting the semantic information of relations, (2) Isomorphic assumption: assuming isomorphism between source and target graphs, which leads to noise and reduced alignment accuracy, and (3) Noise vulnerability: susceptible to noise in the textual features, especially when encountering inconsistent translations or Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems. In this paper, we propose ERAlign, an unsupervised and robust cross-lingual EA pipeline that jointly performs Entity-level and Relation-level Alignment by neighbor triple matching strategy using semantic textual features of relations and entities. Its refinement step iteratively enhances results by fusing entity-level and relation-level alignments based on neighbor triple matching. The additional verification step examines the entities' neighbor triples as the linearized text. This Align-then-Verify pipeline rigorously assesses alignment results, achieving near-perfect alignment even in the presence of noisy textual features of entities. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the robustness and general applicability of ERAlign improved the accuracy and effectiveness of EA tasks, contributing significantly to knowledge-oriented applications.</description>

      <title>COAST: Enhancing the Code Debugging Ability of LLMs through Communicative Agent Based Data Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code debugging is a vital stage of software development, essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the code generation task. Human debugging typically follows a multi-stage process, which includes Bug Localization, Bug Identification, Code Repair, and Code Recognition. However, existing code debugging benchmarks predominantly focus on the Code Repair stage, which offers only a limited perspective on evaluating the debugging capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DEBUGEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the debugging abilities of LLMs by emulating the multi-stage human debugging process. Through evaluating on DEBUGEVAL, we observe that 7B-scale models consistently underperform compared to their larger counterparts, highlighting their limitations in comprehending code semantics. In this case, we propose the COmmunicative Agent-based data SynThesis (COAST) framework, which employs a multi-agent system to generate high-quality training data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that COAST-generated data outperform human-curated and GPT-4-generated data, enabling 7B-scale LLMs to achieve debugging performance comparable to GPT-3.5.

Abstract: In this letter, we use large language models (LLMs) to develop a high-performing and robust beam prediction method. We formulate the millimeter wave (mmWave) beam prediction problem as a time series forecasting task, where the historical observations are aggregated through cross-variable attention and then transformed into text-based representations using a trainable tokenizer. By leveraging the prompt-as-prefix (PaP) technique for contextual enrichment, our method harnesses the power of LLMs to predict future optimal beams. Simulation results demonstrate that our LLM-based approach outperforms traditional learning-based models in prediction accuracy as well as robustness, highlighting the significant potential of LLMs in enhancing wireless communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development (PTC) posits that the development of cognitive levels forms the foundation for human learning across various abilities. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable abilities across a wide variety of tasks, we are curious about the cognitive levels of current LLMs: to what extent they have developed and how this development has been achieved. To this end, we construct a benchmark CogLM (Cognitive Ability Evaluation for Language Model) based on PTC to assess the cognitive levels of LLMs. CogLM comprises 1,220 questions spanning 10 cognitive abilities crafted by more than 20 human experts, providing a comprehensive testbed for the cognitive levels of LLMs. Through extensive experiments across multiple mainstream LLMs with CogLM, we find that: (1) In our testing framework, advanced LLMs (such as GPT-4) have demonstrated human-like cognitive abilities, comparable to those of a 20-year-old human. (2) The parameter size and optimization objective are two key factors affecting the cognitive levels of LLMs. (3) The performance on downstream tasks is positively correlated with the level of cognitive abilities. These findings fill the gap in research on the cognitive abilities of LLMs, tracing the development of LLMs from a cognitive perspective and guiding the future direction of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Make Every Penny Count: Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency for Cost-Efficient Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-consistency (SC), a widely used decoding strategy for chain-of-thought reasoning, shows significant gains across various multi-step reasoning tasks but comes with a high cost due to multiple sampling with the preset size. Its variants, Adaptive self-consistency (ASC) and Early-stopping self-consistency (ESC), dynamically adjust the number of samples based on the posterior distribution of a set of pre-samples, reducing the cost of SC with minimal impact on performance. Both methods, however, do not exploit the prior information about question difficulty. It often results in unnecessary repeated sampling for easy questions that could be accurately answered with just one attempt, wasting resources. To tackle this problem, we propose Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC), which leverages the difficulty information of batch queries from both prior and posterior perspectives to adaptively allocate inference resources, further reducing the overall cost of SC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DSC, we conduct extensive experiments on three popular categories of reasoning tasks: arithmetic, commonsense and symbolic reasoning on six benchmarks. The empirical results show that DSC consistently surpasses the strong baseline ASC and ESC in terms of costs by a significant margin, while attaining comparable performances.</description>

      <title>TASAR: Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02483v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skeletal sequence data, as a widely employed representation of human actions, are crucial in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Recently, adversarial attacks have been proposed in this area, which exposes potential security concerns, and more importantly provides a good tool for model robustness test. Within this research, transfer-based attack is an important tool as it mimics the real-world scenario where an attacker has no knowledge of the target model, but is under-explored in Skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR). Consequently, existing S-HAR attacks exhibit weak adversarial transferability and the reason remains largely unknown. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon via the characterization of the loss function. We find that one prominent indicator of poor transferability is the low smoothness of the loss function. Led by this observation, we improve the transferability by properly smoothening the loss when computing the adversarial examples. This leads to the first Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothened model posterior of pre-trained surrogates, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike existing transfer-based methods which overlook the temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. For exhaustive evaluation, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense models. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the https://github.com/yunfengdiao/Skeleton-Robustness-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SPI-DP, a novel first-order optimizer capable of optimizing robot programs with respect to both high-level task objectives and motion-level constraints. To that end, we introduce DGPMP2-ND, a differentiable collision-free motion planner for serial N-DoF kinematics, and integrate it into an iterative, gradient-based optimization approach for generic, parameterized robot program representations. SPI-DP allows first-order optimization of planned trajectories and program parameters with respect to objectives such as cycle time or smoothness subject to e.g. collision constraints, while enabling humans to understand, modify or even certify the optimized programs. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on two practical household and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>EIA: Environmental Injection Attack on Generalist Web Agents for Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11295v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalist web agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomously completing a wide range of tasks on real websites, significantly boosting human productivity. However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve users' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents accidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for attacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing users' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious content designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our work instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments. We collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most capable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user request. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a defensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate. Notably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via human inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between security and autonomy. However, extra attackers' efforts can make EIA seamlessly adapted, rendering such supervision ineffective. Thus, we further discuss the defenses at the pre- and post-deployment stages of the websites without relying on human supervision and call for more advanced defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Exploring Gaze Pattern Differences Between ASD and TD Children Using Internal Cluster Validity Indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects children's social and communication abilities, with eye-tracking widely used to identify atypical gaze patterns. While unsupervised clustering can automate the creation of areas of interest for gaze feature extraction, the use of internal cluster validity indices, like Silhouette Coefficient, to distinguish gaze pattern differences between ASD and typically developing (TD) children remains underexplored. We explore whether internal cluster validity indices can distinguish ASD from TD children. Specifically, we apply seven clustering algorithms to gaze points and extract 63 internal cluster validity indices to reveal correlations with ASD diagnosis. Using these indices, we train predictive models for ASD diagnosis. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate high predictive accuracy (81\% AUC), validating the effectiveness of these indices.</description>

      <title>WAVE: Weighted Autoregressive Varying Gate for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Weighted Autoregressive Varying gatE (WAVE) attention mechanism equipped with both Autoregressive (AR) and Moving-average (MA) components. It can adapt to various attention mechanisms, enhancing and decoupling their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that WAVE attention that incorporates the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Time Series Inference Agent for Reasoning and Automated Task Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis is crucial in real-world applications, yet traditional methods focus on isolated tasks only, and recent studies on time series reasoning remain limited to simple, single-step inference constrained to natural language answer. In this work, we propose a practical novel task: multi-step time series inference that demands both compositional reasoning and computation precision of time series analysis. To address such challenge, we propose a simple but effective program-aided inference agent that leverages LLMs' reasoning ability to decompose complex tasks into structured execution pipelines. By integrating in-context learning, self-correction, and program-aided execution, our proposed approach ensures accurate and interpretable results. To benchmark performance, we introduce a new dataset and a unified evaluation framework with task-specific success criteria. Experiments show that our approach outperforms standalone general purpose LLMs in both basic time series concept understanding as well as multi-step time series inference task, highlighting the importance of hybrid approaches that combine reasoning with computational precision.</description>

      <title>A Parameter Update Balancing Algorithm for Multi-task Ranking Models in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task ranking models have become essential for modern real-world recommendation systems. While most recommendation researches focus on designing sophisticated models for specific scenarios, achieving performance improvement for multi-task ranking models across various scenarios still remains a significant challenge. Training all tasks naively can result in inconsistent learning, highlighting the need for the development of multi-task optimization (MTO) methods to tackle this challenge. Conventional methods assume that the optimal joint gradient on shared parameters leads to optimal parameter updates. However, the actual update on model parameters may deviates significantly from gradients when using momentum based optimizers such as Adam, and we design and execute statistical experiments to support the observation. In this paper, we propose a novel Parameter Update Balancing algorithm for multi-task optimization, denoted as PUB. In contrast to traditional MTO method which are based on gradient level tasks fusion or loss level tasks fusion, PUB is the first work to optimize multiple tasks through parameter update balancing. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark multi-task ranking datasets demonstrate that PUB consistently improves several multi-task backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, experiments on benchmark computer vision datasets show the great potential of PUB in various multi-task learning scenarios. Furthermore, we deployed our method for an industrial evaluation on the real-world commercial platform, HUAWEI AppGallery, where PUB significantly enhances the online multi-task ranking model, efficiently managing the primary traffic of a crucial channel.</description>

      <title>Single Ground Truth Is Not Enough: Adding Flexibility to Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a challenging task of extracting sentiments along with their corresponding aspects and opinion terms from the text. The inherent subjectivity of span annotation makes variability in the surface forms of extracted terms, complicating the evaluation process. Traditional evaluation methods often constrain ground truths (GT) to a single term, potentially misrepresenting the accuracy of semantically valid predictions that differ in surface form. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and fully automated pipeline that expands existing evaluation sets by adding alternative valid terms for aspect and opinion. Our approach facilitates an equitable assessment of language models by accommodating multiple-answer candidates, resulting in enhanced human agreement compared to single-answer test sets (achieving up to a 10\%p improvement in Kendall's Tau score). Experimental results demonstrate that our expanded evaluation set helps uncover the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in ABSA tasks, which is concealed by the single-answer GT sets. Consequently, our work contributes to the development of a flexible evaluation framework for ABSA by embracing diverse surface forms to span extraction tasks in a cost-effective and reproducible manner. Our code and dataset is open at https://github.com/dudrrm/zoom-in-n-out-absa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based conversational agents has resulted in excessive disclosure of identifiable or sensitive information. However, existing technologies fail to offer perceptible control or account for users' personal preferences about privacy-utility tradeoffs due to the lack of user involvement. To bridge this gap, we designed, built, and evaluated Rescriber, a browser extension that supports user-led data minimization in LLM-based conversational agents by helping users detect and sanitize personal information in their prompts. Our studies (N=12) showed that Rescriber helped users reduce unnecessary disclosure and addressed their privacy concerns. Users' subjective perceptions of the system powered by Llama3-8B were on par with that by GPT-4o. The comprehensiveness and consistency of the detection and sanitization emerge as essential factors that affect users' trust and perceived protection. Our findings confirm the viability of smaller-LLM-powered, user-facing, on-device privacy controls, presenting a promising approach to address the privacy and trust challenges of AI.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Generative Modeling with Variational Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating an individual's counterfactual outcomes under interventions is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in the observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage disentangled exogenous noise abduction that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>GATEAU: Selecting Influential Samples for Long Context Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15633v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models to handle instructions with extremely long contexts has yet to be fully investigated. Previous studies attempt to scale up the available data volume by synthesizing long instruction-following samples, as constructing such a dataset tends to be challenging for annotators. However, a lack of a well-defined strategy for ensuring data quality may introduce low-quality samples and restrict the model performance. Thus, we propose GATEAU, a novel framework to address the unique challenge of long context alignment by identifying the influential samples enriched with long-range dependency relations. Specifically, GATEAU measures the long-range dependencies from two essential aspects: the difficulty of generating target responses due to the long-range dependencies, and the difficulty of understanding long inputs due to such dependencies. Comprehensive experiments indicate that GATEAU effectively identifies influential samples and the model trained on these selected samples exhibits better instruction-following and long-context understanding capabilities.</description>

      <title>TimeSuite: Improving MLLMs for Long Video Understanding via Grounded Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in short video understanding. However, understanding long-form videos still remains challenging for MLLMs. This paper proposes TimeSuite, a collection of new designs to adapt the existing short-form video MLLMs for long video understanding, including a simple yet efficient framework to process long video sequence, a high-quality video dataset for grounded tuning of MLLMs, and a carefully-designed instruction tuning task to explicitly incorporate the grounding supervision in the traditional QA format. Specifically, based on VideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by implementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing Temporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of visual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive grounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k high-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning task type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video descriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit temporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual content when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk caused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite provides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding capability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the benchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively. In addition, VideoChat-T exhibits robust zero-shot temporal grounding capabilities, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art MLLMs. After fine-tuning, it performs on par with the traditional supervised expert models.</description>

      <title>BlueSuffix: Reinforced Blue Teaming for Vision-Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on black-box defense for VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Existing black-box defense methods are either unimodal or bimodal. Unimodal methods enhance either the vision or language module of the VLM, while bimodal methods robustify the model through text-image representation realignment. However, these methods suffer from two limitations: 1) they fail to fully exploit the cross-modal information, or 2) they degrade the model performance on benign inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel blue-team method BlueSuffix that defends target VLMs against jailbreak attacks without compromising its performance under black-box setting. BlueSuffix includes three key components: 1) a visual purifier against jailbreak images, 2) a textual purifier against jailbreak texts, and 3) a blue-team suffix generator using reinforcement fine-tuning for enhancing cross-modal robustness. We empirically show on four VLMs (LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, InstructionBLIP, and Gemini) and four safety benchmarks (Harmful Instruction, AdvBench, MM-SafetyBench, and RedTeam-2K) that BlueSuffix outperforms the baseline defenses by a significant margin. Our BlueSuffix opens up a promising direction for defending VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/Vinsonzyh/BlueSuffix.</description>

      <title>FIRE: Fact-checking with Iterative Retrieval and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fact-checking long-form text is challenging, and it is therefore common practice to break it down into multiple atomic claims. The typical approach to fact-checking these atomic claims involves retrieving a fixed number of pieces of evidence, followed by a verification step. However, this method is usually not cost-effective, as it underutilizes the verification model's internal knowledge of the claim and fails to replicate the iterative reasoning process in human search strategies. To address these limitations, we propose FIRE, a novel agent-based framework that integrates evidence retrieval and claim verification in an iterative manner. Specifically, FIRE employs a unified mechanism to decide whether to provide a final answer or generate a subsequent search query, based on its confidence in the current judgment. We compare FIRE with other strong fact-checking frameworks and find that it achieves slightly better performance while reducing large language model (LLM) costs by an average of 7.6 times and search costs by 16.5 times. These results indicate that FIRE holds promise for application in large-scale fact-checking operations. Our code is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/fire.git.</description>

      <title>Toddlers' Active Gaze Behavior Supports Self-Supervised Object Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toddlers learn to recognize objects from different viewpoints with almost no supervision. Recent works argue that toddlers develop this ability by mapping close-in-time visual inputs to similar representations while interacting with objects. High acuity vision is only available in the central visual field, which May explain why toddlers (much like adults) constantly move around their gaze during such interactions. It is unclear whether/how much toddlers curate their visual experience through these eye movements to support their learning of object representations. In this work, we explore whether a bio-inspired visual learning model can harness toddlers' gaze behavior during a play session to develop view-invariant object recognition. Exploiting head-mounted eye tracking during dyadic play, we simulate toddlers' central visual field experience by cropping image regions centered on the gaze location. This visual stream feeds time-based self-supervised learning algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that toddlers' gaze strategy supports the learning of invariant object representations. Our analysis also reveals that the limited size of the central visual field where acuity is high is crucial for this. We further find that toddlers' visual experience elicits more robust representations compared to adults', mostly because toddlers look at objects they hold themselves for longer bouts. Overall, our work reveals how toddlers' gaze behavior supports self-supervised learning of view-invariant object recognition.</description>

      <title>GraphXAIN: Narratives to Explain Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful technique for machine learning on graph-structured data, yet they pose challenges in interpretability. Existing GNN explanation methods usually yield technical outputs, such as subgraphs and feature importance scores, that are difficult for non-data scientists to understand and thereby violate the purpose of explanations. Motivated by recent Explainable AI (XAI) research, we propose GraphXAIN, a method that generates natural language narratives explaining GNN predictions. GraphXAIN is a model- and explainer-agnostic method that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate explanatory subgraphs and feature importance scores into coherent, story-like explanations of GNN decision-making processes. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate GraphXAIN's ability to improve graph explanations. A survey of machine learning researchers and practitioners reveals that GraphXAIN enhances four explainability dimensions: understandability, satisfaction, convincingness, and suitability for communicating model predictions. When combined with another graph explainer method, GraphXAIN further improves trustworthiness, insightfulness, confidence, and usability. Notably, 95% of participants found GraphXAIN to be a valuable addition to the GNN explanation method. By incorporating natural language narratives, our approach serves both graph practitioners and non-expert users by providing clearer and more effective explanations.</description>

      <title>NYT-Connections: A Deceptively Simple Text Classification Task that Stumps System-1 Thinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on various benchmarks, yet their ability to engage in deliberate reasoning remains questionable. We present NYT-Connections, a collection of 358 simple word classification puzzles derived from the New York Times Connections game. This benchmark is designed to penalize quick, intuitive "System 1" thinking, isolating fundamental reasoning skills. We evaluated six recent LLMs, a simple machine learning heuristic, and humans across three configurations: single-attempt, multiple attempts without hints, and multiple attempts with contextual hints. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap: even top-performing LLMs like GPT-4 fall short of human performance by nearly 30%. Notably, advanced prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency show diminishing returns as task difficulty increases. NYT-Connections uniquely combines linguistic isolation, resistance to intuitive shortcuts, and regular updates to mitigate data leakage, offering a novel tool for assessing LLM reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>All You Need in Knowledge Distillation Is a Tailored Coordinate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is essential in transferring dark knowledge from a large teacher to a small student network, such that the student can be much more efficient than the teacher but with comparable accuracy. Existing KD methods, however, rely on a large teacher trained specifically for the target task, which is both very inflexible and inefficient. In this paper, we argue that a SSL-pretrained model can effectively act as the teacher and its dark knowledge can be captured by the coordinate system or linear subspace where the features lie in. We then need only one forward pass of the teacher, and then tailor the coordinate system (TCS) for the student network. Our TCS method is teacher-free and applies to diverse architectures, works well for KD and practical few-shot learning, and allows cross-architecture distillation with large capacity gap. Experiments show that TCS achieves significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art KD methods, while only requiring roughly half of their training time and GPU memory costs.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Chain-of-Thought from the Perspective of Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as an effective approach for activating latent capabilities in LLMs. Interestingly, we observe that both CoT reasoning and self-training share the core objective: iteratively leveraging model-generated information to progressively reduce prediction uncertainty. Building on this insight, we propose a novel CoT framework to improve reasoning performance. Our framework integrates two key components: (i) a task-specific prompt module that optimizes the initial reasoning process, and (ii) an adaptive reasoning iteration module that dynamically refines the reasoning process and addresses the limitations of previous CoT approaches, \ie over-reasoning and high similarity between consecutive reasoning iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant advantages in both performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Gramian Multimodal Representation Learning and Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human perception integrates multiple modalities, such as vision, hearing, and language, into a unified understanding of the surrounding reality. While recent multimodal models have achieved significant progress by aligning pairs of modalities via contrastive learning, their solutions are unsuitable when scaling to multiple modalities. These models typically align each modality to a designated anchor without ensuring the alignment of all modalities with each other, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring a joint understanding of multiple modalities. In this paper, we structurally rethink the pairwise conventional approach to multimodal learning and we present the novel Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM), which overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. GRAM learns and then aligns $n$ modalities directly in the higher-dimensional space in which modality embeddings lie by minimizing the Gramian volume of the $k$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the modality vectors, ensuring the geometric alignment of all modalities simultaneously. GRAM can replace cosine similarity in any downstream method, holding for 2 to $n$ modalities and providing more meaningful alignment with respect to previous similarity measures. The novel GRAM-based contrastive loss function enhances the alignment of multimodal models in the higher-dimensional embedding space, leading to new state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as video-audio-text retrieval and audio-video classification. The project page, the code, and the pretrained models are available at https://ispamm.github.io/GRAM/.</description>

Abstract: We present DriveGPT, a scalable behavior model for autonomous driving. We model driving as a sequential decision-making task, and learn a transformer model to predict future agent states as tokens in an autoregressive fashion. We scale up our model parameters and training data by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling us to explore the scaling properties in terms of dataset size, model parameters, and compute. We evaluate DriveGPT across different scales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios. In a separate prediction task, DriveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits improved performance by pretraining on a large-scale dataset, further validating the benefits of data scaling.</description>

      <title>Language Models as Continuous Self-Evolving Data Engineers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on various tasks, while the further evolvement is limited to the lack of high-quality training data. In addition, traditional training approaches rely too much on expert-labeled data, setting a ceiling on the performance of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel paradigm named LANCE (LANguage models as Continuous self-Evolving data engineers) that enables LLMs to train themselves by autonomously generating, cleaning, reviewing, and annotating data with preference information. Our approach demonstrates that LLMs can serve as continuous self-evolving data engineers, significantly reducing the time and cost of the post-training data construction. Through iterative fine-tuning on Qwen2 series models, we validate the effectiveness of LANCE across various tasks, showing that it can maintain high-quality data generation and continuously improve model performance. Across multiple benchmark dimensions, LANCE results in an average score enhancement of 3.64 for Qwen2-7B and 1.75 for Qwen2-7B-Instruct. This training paradigm with autonomous data construction not only reduces the reliance on human experts or external models but also ensures that the data aligns with human preferences, paving the way for the development of future superintelligent systems that can exceed human capabilities. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Control-derek/LANCE.</description>

Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have become critical tools for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and autonomous navigation. Accurate estimation of wave direction is essential for improving USV navigation and ensuring operational safety, but traditional methods often suffer from high costs and limited spatial resolution. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict wave direction using sensor data collected from USVs. Experimental results show the capability of the LSTM model to learn temporal dependencies and provide accurate predictions, outperforming simpler baselines.</description>

      <title>WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Topic-Aware Knowledge Graph with Large Language Models for Interoperability in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of knowledge graphs in recommender systems has become one of the common approaches to addressing data sparsity and cold start problems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for processing side and context information within knowledge graphs. However, consistent integration across various systems remains challenging due to the need for domain expert intervention and differences in system characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a consistent approach that extracts both general and specific topics from both side and context information using LLMs. First, general topics are iteratively extracted and updated from side information. Then, specific topics are extracted using context information. Finally, to address synonymous topics generated during the specific topic extraction process, a refining algorithm processes and resolves these issues effectively. This approach allows general topics to capture broad knowledge across diverse item characteristics, while specific topics emphasize detailed attributes, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic features of items and the preferences of users. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation performance across diverse knowledge graphs.</description>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse applications, including chatbot assistants and code generation, aligning their behavior with safety and ethical standards has become paramount. However, jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to elicit unintended or harmful outputs, threaten LLMs' safety significantly. In this paper, we introduce Layer-AdvPatcher, a novel methodology designed to defend against jailbreak attacks by utilizing an unlearning strategy to patch specific layers within LLMs through self-augmented datasets. Our insight is that certain layer(s), tend to produce affirmative tokens when faced with harmful prompts. By identifying these layers and adversarially exposing them to generate more harmful data, one can understand their inherent and diverse vulnerabilities to attacks. With these exposures, we then "unlearn" these issues, reducing the impact of affirmative tokens and hence minimizing jailbreak risks while keeping the model's responses to safe queries intact. We conduct extensive experiments on two models, four benchmark datasets, and multiple state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Results indicate that our framework reduces the harmfulness and attack success rate of jailbreak attacks without compromising utility for benign queries compared to recent defense methods.

      <title>URSA: Understanding and Verifying Chain-of-thought Reasoning in Multimodal Mathematics</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is widely used to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The introduction of process supervision for CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on improving test-time scaling, thereby unlocking the System 2-style thinking capabilities of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving both deliberate reasoning and fine-grained verification. In this work, we propose a novel framework that introduces System 2-style thinking to multimodal mathematical reasoning. We introduce a three-module CoT data synthesis process that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. This process generates MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset. Furthermore, we implement a dual-view trajectory labeling automation that targets both visual grounding fidelity and deductive chain validity, resulting in the DualMath-1.1M dataset. The URSA-8B model, trained on MMathCoT-1M, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among similarly sized multimodal LLMs on six popular reasoning benchmarks. Training URSA-8B further on the DualMath-1.1M dataset yields URSA-RM-8B, a verifier that enhances URSA-8B's test-time performance and surpasses strong closed-source multimodal MLLMs like GPT-4o. The model weights, training data, and code have been open-sourced: https://github.com/URSA-MATH/URSA-MATH.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Domain-adaptive Post-training for Financial LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Attention-guided Self-reflection for Zero-shot Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucination has emerged as a significant barrier to the effective application of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) approach for zero-shot hallucination detection in LLMs. The AGSER method utilizes attention contributions to categorize the input query into attentive and non-attentive queries. Each query is then processed separately through the LLMs, allowing us to compute consistency scores between the generated responses and the original answer. The difference between the two consistency scores serves as a hallucination estimator. In addition to its efficacy in detecting hallucinations, AGSER notably reduces computational overhead, requiring only three passes through the LLM and utilizing two sets of tokens. We have conducted extensive experiments with four widely-used LLMs across three different hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot hallucination detection.</description>

      <title>MARIO: A Mixed Annotation Framework For Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing polyp segmentation models are limited by high labeling costs and the small size of datasets. Additionally, vast polyp datasets remain underutilized because these models typically rely on a single type of annotation. To address this dilemma, we introduce MARIO, a mixed supervision model designed to accommodate various annotation types, significantly expanding the range of usable data. MARIO learns from underutilized datasets by incorporating five forms of supervision: pixel-level, box-level, polygon-level, scribblelevel, and point-level. Each form of supervision is associated with a tailored loss that effectively leverages the supervision labels while minimizing the noise. This allows MARIO to move beyond the constraints of relying on a single annotation type. Furthermore, MARIO primarily utilizes dataset with weak and cheap annotations, reducing the dependence on large-scale, fully annotated ones. Experimental results across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIO consistently outperforms existing methods, highlighting its efficacy in balancing trade-offs between different forms of supervision and maximizing polyp segmentation performance</description>

      <title>Advancing General Multimodal Capability of Vision-language Models with Pyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in advancing general artificial intelligence, yet the irrational encoding of visual positions persists in inhibiting the models' comprehensive perception performance across different levels of granularity. In this work, we propose Pyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding (PyPE), a novel approach designed to enhance the perception of visual tokens within VLMs. By assigning visual position indexes from the periphery to the center and expanding the central receptive field incrementally, PyPE addresses the limitations of traditional raster-scan methods and mitigates the long-term decay effects induced by Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Our method reduces the relative distance between interrelated visual elements and instruction tokens, promoting a more rational allocation of attention weights and allowing for a multi-granularity perception of visual elements and countering the over-reliance on anchor tokens. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that PyPE consistently improves the general capabilities of VLMs across various sizes.

      <title>Humanity's Last Exam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90\% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 3,000 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.</description>

      <title>MedAgentBench: A Realistic Virtual EHR Environment to Benchmark Medical LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements, particularly in their ability to serve as agents thereby surpassing their traditional role as chatbots. These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 300 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2) achieves a success rate of 69.67%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement which gives the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.</description>

      <title>Surface Vision Mamba: Leveraging Bidirectional State Space Model for Efficient Spherical Manifold Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention-based methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in modelling long-range dependencies on spherical cortical surfaces, surpassing traditional Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) models. However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Rongzhao-He/surface-vision-mamba.</description>

      <title>Noise-conditioned Energy-based Annealed Rewards (NEAR): A Generative Framework for Imitation Learning from Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new imitation learning framework based on energy-based generative models capable of learning complex, physics-dependent, robot motion policies through state-only expert motion trajectories. Our algorithm, called Noise-conditioned Energy-based Annealed Rewards (NEAR), constructs several perturbed versions of the expert's motion data distribution and learns smooth, and well-defined representations of the data distribution's energy function using denoising score matching. We propose to use these learnt energy functions as reward functions to learn imitation policies via reinforcement learning. We also present a strategy to gradually switch between the learnt energy functions, ensuring that the learnt rewards are always well-defined in the manifold of policy-generated samples. We evaluate our algorithm on complex humanoid tasks such as locomotion and martial arts and compare it with state-only adversarial imitation learning algorithms like Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP). Our framework sidesteps the optimisation challenges of adversarial imitation learning techniques and produces results comparable to AMP in several quantitative metrics across multiple imitation settings.</description>

      <title>TAID: Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation for Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their size poses significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation, a widely-used technique for transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model, presents a promising approach for model compression. A significant remaining issue lies in the major differences between teacher and student models, namely the substantial capacity gap, mode averaging, and mode collapse, which pose barriers during distillation. To address these issues, we introduce $\textit{Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation (TAID)}$, a novel knowledge distillation approach that dynamically interpolates student and teacher distributions through an adaptive intermediate distribution, gradually shifting from the student's initial distribution towards the teacher's distribution. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating TAID's ability to prevent mode collapse and empirically show its effectiveness in addressing the capacity gap while balancing mode averaging and mode collapse. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate TAID's superior performance across various model sizes and architectures in both instruction tuning and pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase TAID's practical impact by developing two state-of-the-art compact foundation models: $\texttt{TAID-LLM-1.5B}$ for language tasks and $\texttt{TAID-VLM-2B}$ for vision-language tasks. These results demonstrate TAID's effectiveness in creating high-performing and efficient models, advancing the development of more accessible AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Towards Transparent and Accurate Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health issue of significance that must be diagnosed as early as possible and managed well. This study presents a framework for diabetes prediction using Machine Learning (ML) models, complemented with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools, to investigate both the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the predictions from ML models. Data Preprocessing is based on the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and feature scaling used on the Diabetes Binary Health Indicators dataset to deal with class imbalance and variability of clinical features. The ensemble model provided high accuracy, with a test accuracy of 92.50% and an ROC-AUC of 0.975. BMI, Age, General Health, Income, and Physical Activity were the most influential predictors obtained from the model explanations. The results of this study suggest that ML combined with XAI is a promising means of developing accurate and computationally transparent tools for use in healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Generating crossmodal gene expression from cancer histopathology improves multimodal AI predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging research has highlighted that artificial intelligence based multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomic features can improve cancer diagnosis (grading/subtyping) and prognosis (survival risk) prediction. However, such direct fusion for joint decision is impractical in real clinical settings, where histopathology is still the gold standard for diagnosis and transcriptomic tests are rarely requested, at least in the public healthcare system. With our novel diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model PathGen, we show that genomic expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predicts cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed attention maps). PathGen code is available for open use by the research community through GitHub at https://github.com/Samiran-Dey/PathGen.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Inference Approach to Inference-Time Scaling of LLMs using Particle-Based Monte Carlo Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

      <title>Syntriever: How to Train Your Retriever with Synthetic Data from LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have boosted progress in many AI applications. Recently, there were attempts to distill the vast knowledge of LLMs into information retrieval systems. Those distillation methods mostly use output probabilities of LLMs which are unavailable in the latest black-box LLMs. We propose Syntriever, a training framework for retrievers using synthetic data from black-box LLMs. Syntriever consists of two stages. Firstly in the distillation stage, we synthesize relevant and plausibly irrelevant passages and augmented queries using chain-of-thoughts for the given queries. LLM is asked to self-verify the synthetic data for possible hallucinations, after which retrievers are trained with a loss designed to cluster the embeddings of relevant passages. Secondly in the alignment stage, we align the retriever with the preferences of LLMs. We propose a preference modeling called partial Plackett-Luce ranking to learn LLM preferences with regularization which prevents the model from deviating excessively from that trained in the distillation stage. Experiments show that Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets from various domains in nDCG@$K$. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/kmswin1/Syntriever}{https://github.com/kmswin1/Syntriever}.</description>

      <title>ARR: Question Answering with Large Language Models via Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance on challenging benchmarks that are often structured as multiple-choice question-answering (QA) tasks. Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in LLMs but provides only vague and generic guidance ("think step by step"). This paper introduces ARR, an intuitive and effective zero-shot prompting method that explicitly incorporates three key steps in QA solving: analyzing the intent of the question, retrieving relevant information, and reasoning step by step. Comprehensive experiments across diverse and challenging QA tasks demonstrate that ARR consistently improves the Baseline (without ARR prompting) and outperforms CoT. Ablation and case studies further validate the positive contributions of each component: analyzing, retrieving, and reasoning. Notably, intent analysis plays a vital role in ARR. Additionally, extensive evaluations across various model sizes, LLM series, and generation settings solidify the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of ARR.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</description>

      <title>APE: Faster and Longer Context-Augmented Generation via Adaptive Parallel Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context-augmented generation (CAG) techniques, including RAG and ICL, require the efficient combination of multiple contexts to generate responses to user queries. Directly inputting these contexts as a sequence introduces a considerable computational burden by re-encoding the combined selection of contexts for every request. To address this, we explore the promising potential of parallel encoding to independently pre-compute and cache each context's KV states. This approach enables the direct loading of cached states during inference while accommodating more contexts through position reuse across contexts. However, due to misalignments in attention distribution, directly applying parallel encoding results in a significant performance drop. To enable effective and efficient CAG, we propose Adaptive Parallel Encoding ($\textbf{APE}$), which brings shared prefix, attention temperature, and scaling factor to align the distribution of parallel encoding with sequential encoding. Results on RAG and ICL tasks demonstrate that APE can preserve 98% and 93% sequential encoding performance using the same inputs while outperforming parallel encoding by 3.6% and 7.9%, respectively. It also scales to many-shot CAG, effectively encoding hundreds of contexts in parallel. Efficiency evaluation shows that APE can achieve an end-to-end 4.5$\times$ speedup by reducing 28$\times$ prefilling time for a 128K-length context.</description>

      <title>On Memory Construction and Retrieval for Personalized Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To deliver coherent and personalized experiences in long-term conversations, existing approaches typically perform retrieval augmented response generation by constructing memory banks from conversation history at either the turn-level, session-level, or through summarization techniques. In this paper, we present two key findings: (1) The granularity of memory unit matters: Turn-level, session-level, and summarization-based methods each exhibit limitations in both memory retrieval accuracy and the semantic quality of the retrieved content. (2) Prompt compression methods, such as \textit{LLMLingua-2}, can effectively serve as a denoising mechanism, enhancing memory retrieval accuracy across different granularities. Building on these insights, we propose SeCom, a method that constructs a memory bank with topical segments by introducing a conversation Segmentation model, while performing memory retrieval based on Compressed memory units. Experimental results show that SeCom outperforms turn-level, session-level, and several summarization-based methods on long-term conversation benchmarks such as LOCOMO and Long-MT-Bench+. Additionally, the proposed conversation segmentation method demonstrates superior performance on dialogue segmentation datasets such as DialSeg711, TIAGE, and SuperDialSeg.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning via Information Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we effectively remove or "unlearn" undesirable information, such as specific features or individual data points, from a learning outcome while minimizing utility loss and ensuring rigorous guarantees? We introduce a mathematical framework based on information-theoretic regularization to address both feature and data point unlearning. For feature unlearning, we derive a unified solution that simultaneously optimizes diverse learning objectives, including entropy, conditional entropy, KL-divergence, and the energy of conditional probability. For data point unlearning, we first propose a novel definition that serves as a practical condition for unlearning via retraining, is easy to verify, and aligns with the principles of differential privacy from an inference perspective. Then, we provide provable guarantees for our framework on data point unlearning. By combining flexibility in learning objectives with simplicity in regularization design, our approach is highly adaptable and practical for a wide range of machine learning and AI applications.</description>

      <title>CSR-Bench: Benchmarking LLM Agents in Deployment of Computer Science Research Repositories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of computer science research projects demands more effective tools for deploying code repositories. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Anthropic Claude and Meta Llama, have demonstrated significant advancements across various fields of computer science research, including the automation of diverse software engineering tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex code development tasks of research projects, particularly for NLP/CV/AI/ML/DM topics, we introduce CSR-Bench, a benchmark for Computer Science Research projects. This benchmark assesses LLMs from various aspects including accuracy, efficiency, and deployment script quality, aiming to explore their potential in conducting computer science research autonomously. We also introduce a novel framework, CSR-Agents, that utilizes multiple LLM agents to automate the deployment of GitHub code repositories of computer science research projects. Specifically, by checking instructions from markdown files and interpreting repository structures, the model generates and iteratively improves bash commands that set up the experimental environments and deploy the code to conduct research tasks. Preliminary results from CSR-Bench indicate that LLM agents can significantly enhance the workflow of repository deployment, thereby boosting developer productivity and improving the management of developmental workflows.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Robustness and Accuracy in Mixture of Experts: A Dual-Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) have shown remarkable success in leveraging specialized expert networks for complex machine learning tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks presents a critical challenge for deployment in robust applications. This paper addresses the critical question of how to incorporate robustness into MoEs while maintaining high natural accuracy. We begin by analyzing the vulnerability of MoE components, finding that expert networks are notably more susceptible to adversarial attacks than the router. Based on this insight, we propose a targeted robust training technique that integrates a novel loss function to enhance the adversarial robustness of MoE, requiring only the robustification of one additional expert without compromising training or inference efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a dual-model strategy that linearly combines a standard MoE model with our robustified MoE model using a smoothing parameter. This approach allows for flexible control over the robustness-accuracy trade-off. We further provide theoretical foundations by deriving certified robustness bounds for both the single MoE and the dual-model. To push the boundaries of robustness and accuracy, we propose a novel joint training strategy JTDMoE for the dual-model. This joint training enhances both robustness and accuracy beyond what is achievable with separate models. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets using ResNet18 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>UniZyme: A Unified Protein Cleavage Site Predictor Enhanced with Enzyme Active-Site Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage is essential for many biological functions. Accurate prediction of cleavage sites can facilitate various applications such as drug development, enzyme design, and a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms. However, most existing models are restricted to an individual enzyme, which neglects shared knowledge of enzymes and fails generalize to novel enzymes. Thus, we introduce a unified protein cleavage site predictor named UniZyme, which can generalize across diverse enzymes. To enhance the enzyme encoding for the protein cleavage site prediction, UniZyme employs a novel biochemically-informed model architecture along with active-site knowledge of proteolytic enzymes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniZyme achieves high accuracy in predicting cleavage sites across a range of proteolytic enzymes, including unseen enzymes. The code is available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UniZyme-4A67.</description>

      <title>TRADES: Generating Realistic Market Simulations with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial markets are complex systems characterized by high statistical noise, nonlinearity, and constant evolution. Thus, modeling them is extremely hard. We address the task of generating realistic and responsive Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulations, which are fundamental for calibrating and testing trading strategies, performing market impact experiments, and generating synthetic market data. Previous works lack realism, usefulness, and responsiveness of the generated simulations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel TRAnsformer-based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Engine for LOB Simulations (TRADES). TRADES generates realistic order flows conditioned on the state of the market, leveraging a transformer-based architecture that captures the temporal and spatial characteristics of high-frequency market data. There is a notable absence of quantitative metrics for evaluating generative market simulation models in the literature. To tackle this problem, we adapt the predictive score, a metric measured as an MAE, by training a stock price predictive model on synthetic data and testing it on real data. We compare TRADES with previous works on two stocks, reporting an x3.27 and x3.47 improvement over SoTA according to the predictive score, demonstrating that we generate useful synthetic market data for financial downstream tasks. We assess TRADES's market simulation realism and responsiveness, showing that it effectively learns the conditional data distribution and successfully reacts to an experimental agent, giving sprout to possible calibrations and evaluations of trading strategies and market impact experiments. We developed DeepMarket, the first open-source Python framework for market simulation with deep learning. Our repository includes a synthetic LOB dataset composed of TRADES's generates simulations. We release the code at github.com/LeonardoBerti00/DeepMarket.</description>

      <title>IRepair: An Intent-Aware Approach to Repair Data-Driven Errors in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Not a day goes by without hearing about the impressive feats of large language models (LLMs), and equally, not a day passes without hearing about their challenges. LLMs are notoriously vulnerable to biases in their dataset, leading to issues such as toxicity. While domain-adaptive training has been employed to mitigate these issues, these techniques often address all model parameters indiscriminately during the repair process, resulting in poor repair quality and reduced model versatility. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic slicing-based intent-aware LLM repair strategy, IRepair. This approach selectively targets the most error-prone sections of the model for repair. Specifically, we propose dynamically slicing the model's most sensitive layers that require immediate attention, concentrating repair efforts on those areas. This method enables more effective repairs with potentially less impact on the model's overall performance by altering a smaller portion of the model. We evaluated our technique on three models from the GPT2 and GPT-Neo families, with parameters ranging from 800M to 1.6B, in a toxicity mitigation setup. Our results show that IRepair repairs errors 43.6% more effectively while causing 46% less disruption to general performance compared to the closest baseline, direct preference optimization. Our empirical analysis also reveals that errors are more concentrated in a smaller section of the model, with the top 20% of layers exhibiting 773% more error density than the remaining 80\%. This highlights the need for selective repair. Additionally, we demonstrate that a dynamic selection approach is essential for addressing errors dispersed throughout the model, ensuring a robust and efficient repair.</description>

      <title>CodeI/O: Condensing Reasoning Patterns via Code Input-Output Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental capability of Large Language Models. While prior research predominantly focuses on enhancing narrow skills like math or code generation, improving performance on many other reasoning tasks remains challenging due to sparse and fragmented training data. To address this issue, we propose CodeI/O, a novel approach that systematically condenses diverse reasoning patterns inherently embedded in contextually-grounded codes, through transforming the original code into a code input-output prediction format. By training models to predict inputs/outputs given code and test cases entirely in natural language as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, we expose them to universal reasoning primitives -- like logic flow planning, state-space searching, decision tree traversal, and modular decomposition -- while decoupling structured reasoning from code-specific syntax and preserving procedural rigor. Experimental results demonstrate CodeI/O leads to consistent improvements across symbolic, scientific, logic, math &amp; numerical, and commonsense reasoning tasks. By matching the existing ground-truth outputs or re-executing the code with predicted inputs, we can verify each prediction and further enhance the CoTs through multi-turn revision, resulting in CodeI/O++ and achieving higher performance. Our data and models are available at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/CodeIO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Music-Language Models has greatly enhanced the automatic music generation capability of AI systems, but they are also limited in their coverage of the musical genres and cultures of the world. We present a study of the datasets and research papers for music generation and quantify the bias and under-representation of genres. We find that only 5.7% of the total hours of existing music datasets come from non-Western genres, which naturally leads to disparate performance of the models across genres. We then investigate the efficacy of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques in mitigating this bias. Our experiments with two popular models -- MusicGen and Mustango, for two underrepresented non-Western music traditions -- Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, highlight the promises as well as the non-triviality of cross-genre adaptation of music through small datasets, implying the need for more equitable baseline music-language models that are designed for cross-cultural transfer learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent image-to-video generation methods have demonstrated success in enabling control over one or two visual elements, such as camera trajectory or object motion. However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have become general-purpose assistants, exhibiting diverse capabilities across numerous domains through training on web-scale data. It remains challenging to precisely characterize even a fraction of the full spectrum of capabilities and potential risks in any new model. Existing evaluation approaches often require significant human effort, and it is taking increasing effort to design ever harder challenges for more capable models. We introduce Automated Capability Discovery (ACD), a framework that designates one foundation model as a scientist to systematically propose open-ended tasks probing the abilities of a subject model (potentially itself). By combining frontier models with ideas from the field of open-endedness, ACD automatically and systematically uncovers both surprising capabilities and failures in the subject model. We demonstrate ACD across a range of foundation models (including the GPT, Claude, and Llama series), showing that it automatically reveals thousands of capabilities that would be challenging for any single team to uncover. We further validate our method's automated scoring with extensive human surveys, observing high agreement between model-generated and human evaluations. By leveraging foundation models' ability to both create tasks and self-evaluate, ACD is a significant step toward scalable, automated evaluation of novel AI systems. All code and evaluation logs are open-sourced at https://github.com/conglu1997/ACD.</description>

      <title>SoK: A Classification for AI-driven Personalized Privacy Assistants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To help users make privacy-related decisions, personalized privacy assistants based on AI technology have been developed in recent years. These AI-driven Personalized Privacy Assistants (AI-driven PPAs) can reap significant benefits for users, who may otherwise struggle to make decisions regarding their personal data in environments saturated with privacy-related decision requests. However, no study systematically inquired about the features of these AI-driven PPAs, their underlying technologies, or the accuracy of their decisions. To fill this gap, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) to map the existing solutions found in the scientific literature. We screened 1697 unique research papers over the last decade (2013-2023), constructing a classification from 39 included papers. As a result, this SoK reviews several aspects of existing research on AI-driven PPAs in terms of types of publications, contributions, methodological quality, and other quantitative insights. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification for AI-driven PPAs, delving into their architectural choices, system contexts, types of AI used, data sources, types of decisions, and control over decisions, among other facets. Based on our SoK, we further underline the research gaps and challenges and formulate recommendations for the design and development of AI-driven PPAs as well as avenues for future research.</description>

Abstract: Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.</description>
