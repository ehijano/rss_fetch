      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-contained solution of a generalized Apollonius problem of constructing a circle that intersects each of the three pair-wise non-intersecting circles at one of the three given angles.</description>

      <title>A Leibniz/NSA comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some similarities between Leibnizian and Robinsonian calculi, and address some objections raised by historians. The comparison with NSA facilitates our appreciation of some Leibnizian procedures that may otherwise seem obscure. We argue that Leibniz used genuine infinitesimals and infinite quantities which are not merely stenography for Archimedean Exhaustion and that Leibniz's procedures therefore find better proxies in NSA than in modern Weierstrassian mathematics.</description>

      <title>Democratizing Signal Processing and Machine Learning: Math Learning Equity for Elementary and Middle School Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal Processing (SP) and Machine Learning (ML) rely on good math and coding knowledge, in particular, linear algebra, probability, and complex numbers. A good grasp of these relies on scalar algebra learned in middle school. The ability to understand and use scalar algebra well, in turn, relies on a good foundation in basic arithmetic. Because of various systemic barriers, many students are not able to build a strong foundation in arithmetic in elementary school. This leads them to struggle with algebra and everything after that. Since math learning is cumulative, the gap between those without a strong early foundation and everyone else keeps increasing over the school years and becomes difficult to fill in college. In this article we discuss how SP faculty and graduate students can play an important role in starting, and participating in, university-run (or other) out-of-school math support programs to supplement students' learning. Two example programs run by the authors (CyMath at ISU and Ab7G at Purdue) are briefly described. The second goal of this article is to use our perspective as SP, and engineering, educators who have seen the long-term impact of elementary school math teaching policies, to provide some simple almost zero cost suggestions that elementary schools could adopt to improve math learning: (i) more math practice in school, (ii) send small amounts of homework (individual work is critical in math), and (iii) parent awareness (math resources, need for early math foundation, clear in-school test information and sharing of feedback from the tests). In summary, good early math support (in school and through out-of-school programs) can help make SP and ML more accessible.</description>
