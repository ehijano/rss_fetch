      <title>Surrogate distributed radiological sources III: quantitative distributed source reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this third part of a multi-paper series, we present quantitative image reconstruction results from aerial measurements of eight different surrogate distributed gamma-ray sources on flat terrain. We show that our quantitative imaging methods can accurately reconstruct the expected shapes, and, after appropriate calibration, the absolute activity of the distributed sources. We conduct several studies of imaging performance versus various measurement and reconstruction parameters, including detector altitude and raster pass spacing, data and modeling fidelity, and regularization type and strength. The imaging quality performance is quantified using various quantitative image quality metrics. Our results confirm the utility of point source arrays as surrogates for truly distributed radiological sources, advancing the quantitative capabilities of Scene Data Fusion gamma-ray imaging methods.</description>

      <title>A deconvolution based signal reconstruction capable of piled-up pulse separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides a computationally effective deconvolution algorithm capable to reconstruct piled-up events in scintillating detector systems with high count rate where fully digitized waveforms are available. A fixed-point iteration algorithm is suggested and used to find properties of the signals which are later used during the signal preprocessing stage. The impulse response function is successfully extracted even from heavily piled-up event waveforms using an iterative approach. A methodology for pulse time and amplitude reconstruction is based on a deconvolution algorithm, which is described in details and some results are presented. The presented algorithms are meant to be general and might be successfully applied to other fields with minor to no modifications.</description>

      <title>Development of a Dual-Spectroscopic System to Rapidly Measure Diisopropyl Methyl Phosphonate (DIMP) Decomposition and Temperature in a Reactive Powder Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of systems to measure and optimize emerging energetic material performance is critical for CWA defeat. This study documents a combination of two spectroscopic systems designed to monitor decomposition of a CWA simulant and temperature. The first system is a custom benchtop Polygonal Rotating Mirror Infrared Spectrometer (PRiMIRS) incorporating a fully customizable sample cell to observe decomposition of DIMP as it interacts with combusting composite metal particles. The second is TDLAS used to monitor increases in background gas temperatures as the composite metal powders combust. The PRiMIRS system demonstrates a very high SNR at Hz, reasonable SNR when operating at 100 Hz, and capabilities of resolving spectral features with a FWHM resolution of 15 cm^-1. TDLAS was able to monitor temperature rises between room temperature and 230C +/- 5C at 100 Hz.For testing, liquid DIMP was inserted in a preheated SS cell to generate DIMP vapor and (Al-8Mg):Zr metal powders were ignited in a SS mount with a resistively heated nichrome wire at one end of the cell. The ignited particles propagated across the cell containing DIMP vapor. The path averaged gas temperature in the preheated SS cell rises rapidly (100ms) and decays slowly (&lt; 5 s) but remains below 230C during particle combustion, a temperature at which the thermal decomposition of DIMP is not observed over similarly short timescales (seconds). However, when combusting particles were introduced to the DIMP vapor (heterogenous environment), spectral signatures indicative of decomposition products such as IMP and IPA were observed within seconds.</description>

      <title>Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters for Deep Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the development of Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters (AF-MPDTs) present themselves to be an increasingly promising propulsion technology for deep space exploration missions. Various entities, ranging from state-sponsored institutions to privately-owned startups, have developed AF-MPDTs across a wide range of power levels. Current developments in superconducting technologies, namely High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coils such as REBCO, have enabled research into the integration of HTS coils into the applied-field module to generate MPD thrust. Developments in space cryocoolers have opened the doors for HTS use within a spaceflight design of an AF-MPDT, where the applied-field module is at 40 K. A TRL of 4-5 has been reached by some AF-MPDT prototypes; venturing beyond this will require higher cooling power space cryocoolers to be developed in parallel and appropriately integrated into the thruster. Moreover, bespoke thermal control is required to maintain the thruster's extreme temperature gradient where the cryocooled HTS are in close proximity to the thruster cathode. More effective space power supply units with higher power generation is a further limitation to reaching TRL 9. This review examines the underlying principles behind AF-MPDT propulsion and the recent global developments in AF-MPDT technology, with an in-depth analysis and critical discussion on the spaceflight components necessary to permit AF-MPDTs to become a widely-adopted spaceflight-ready propulsion technology.</description>
