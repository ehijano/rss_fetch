      <title>Evaluating the AI-Lab Intervention: Impact on Student Perception and Use of Generative AI in Early Undergraduate Computer Science Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering courses at Purdue University.
  Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.
  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap" between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill development.
  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Threat Detection and Prevention Framework for IoT Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and scale of the Internet of Things (IoT) have made security a critical concern. This paper presents a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for comprehensive threat detection and prevention in IoT environments. The system integrates lightweight LLMs fine-tuned on IoT-specific datasets (IoT-23, TON_IoT) for real-time anomaly detection and automated, context-aware mitigation strategies optimized for resource-constrained devices. A modular Docker-based deployment enables scalable and reproducible evaluation across diverse network conditions. Experimental results in simulated IoT environments demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy, response latency, and resource efficiency over traditional security methods. The proposed framework highlights the potential of LLM-driven, autonomous security solutions for future IoT ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Integrating VR tours in online language learning:A design-based research study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the integration of virtual reality (VR) tours in online English lessons tailored for adult learners. The study utilised a design-based research approach to evaluate the effectiveness of VR tours in this context. It specifically examined the responses of adult learners to this instructional strategy by collecting data through surveys, observation notes and interviews with four learners in Japan and five learners in France, most of whom completed 10 lessons over 4 months. The research findings highlight the effectiveness of VR tours in enhancing learner motivation. Additionally, they demonstrate that perceived learning outcomes are influenced not only by the immersive experience of spatial presence but also by the novelty of technological and scenery-related aspects within the VR environment, as well as factors related to lesson design and individual learner characteristics.</description>

      <title>Urban Air Mobility as a System of Systems: An LLM-Enhanced Holonic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution. Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability, and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.</description>

      <title>Open-Source LLM-Driven Federated Transformer for Predictive IoV Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Chemputer and Chemputation - A Universal Chemical Compound Synthesis Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemputation, the execution of code controlled reaction pathways on universally reconfigurable hardware, offers a route to treating chemical synthesis as a formally computable i.e. chemputable process to produce chemical compounds or molecules. Here I present a proof that a chemputer endowed with a finite, but extensible reagent, catalyst, process condition sets, and a chempiler that maps reaction graphs to hardware graphs, and dynamic error correction handles, is universal for the synthesis of any stable, isolable molecule that respects conservation of matter and finite reaction time and can be produced in detectable amounts. In developing this proof, I also expanded the internationally accepted definition of a molecule, by requiring that the molecule must be reachable in an analytically accessible amount using concepts from assembly theory. This shows that error correction is a vital requirement for chemputation, and I formalise the universal chemical synthesis theorem, demonstrate a full worked example, and explore the practical limits imposed by vessel count and sensing bandwidth. In doing so, I show that chemical reactions are not implicit blackbox functions but emergent graph operations or chemical transformations over Reagents (R) x Process (P) x Catalyst (K). The role of universally configurable hardware is also highlighted, with the introduction of a chempiling function that translates synthesis pathways into executable hardware configurations.</description>

      <title>On the Reliability of Information Retrieval From MDS Coded Data in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical analysis of the probability of successfully retrieving data encoded with MDS codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon codes) in DNA storage systems. We study this probability under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) substitution errors, focusing on a common code design strategy that combines inner and outer MDS codes. Our analysis demonstrates how this probability depends on factors such as the total number of sequencing reads, their distribution across strands, the rates of the inner and outer codes, and the substitution error probabilities. These results provide actionable insights into optimizing DNA storage systems under reliability constraints, including determining the minimum number of sequencing reads needed for reliable data retrieval and identifying the optimal balance between the rates of inner and outer MDS codes.</description>
