      <title>Unified Evolution of Electromagnetic Sources in Homogeneous Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the behavior of elementary electromagnetic sources, i.e., point-like electric charges and intrinsic magnetic dipoles, in the presence of homogeneous electromagnetic fields in a classical and covariant setting. We show that the respective evolution equations for both kinds of sources can be formulated using a single Lorentz-like transformation with suitably adjusted parameters, thereby unifying the fundamental behavior of these intrinsic particle properties. We arrive at this description by expressing the evolution of the electric sources, governed by the Lorentz force, as a series of infinitesimal boosts and rotations acting on them, with the electric and magnetic field as the corresponding parameters. Upon suitable adjustments, we find a new effective Lorentz-like transformation, applicable to both electric and magnetic sources. We provide the results using both the tensorial and pseudovector representation of the magnetic sources. Finally, we obtain a non-relativistic limit of the evolution equation for magnetic sources.</description>

      <title>Kozai Lidov Cycles = Simple Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quadrupole Kozai mechanism, which describes the hierarchical three-body problem in the leading order, is shown to be equivalent to a simple pendulum where the change in the eccentricity squared equals the height of the pendulum from its lowest point: $e_{\text{max}}^2-e^2=h=l\left(1-\cos{\theta}\right)$. In particular, this results in useful expressions for the KLC period, and the maximal and minimal eccentricities in terms of orbital constants. We derive the equivalence using the vector coordinates $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\textbf{j}+\textbf{e}, \boldsymbol{\beta}=\textbf{j}-\textbf{e}$ for the inner Keplerian orbit, where $\textbf{j}$ is the normalized specific angular momentum, and $\textbf{e}$ is the eccentricity vector. The equations of motion for $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ simplify to $\dot{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}=2\partial_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \phi \times \boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\dot{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=2\partial_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \phi \times \boldsymbol{\beta}$, where $\phi$ is the normalized averaged interaction potential and are symmetric to replacing $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ for the KLC quadratic potential. Their constraints simplify to $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^2=\boldsymbol{\beta}^2=1$, and they are distributed uniformly and independently on the unit sphere for a uniform distribution in phase space (with a fixed energy).</description>

      <title>Applications of geometric algebra to black holes and Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0412070</link>
      <description>arXiv:physics/0412070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract:   We discuss the applications of Gauge Theory of Gravity (GTG) within the language of geometric algebra to black holes and Hawking radiation. Applications include the Unruh effect, the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations in several backgrounds, such as the de Sitter and Rindler metrics as well as spherically and axially black hole backgrounds. The analysis is also generalised to allow the presence of magnetic monopoles. We rederive the Hawking temperature for all cases. The derivation of both the correct Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics as well as the Hawking temperature may suggest that the method of calculations we employ here - geometric algebra - is really powerful in dealing with the problems in various strong gravitational backgrounds.</description>
