      <title>Evaluation and optimization of deep learning models for enhanced detection of brain cancer using transmission optical microscopy of thin brain tissue samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical transmission spectroscopy is one method to understand brain tissue structural properties from brain tissue biopsy samples, yet manual interpretation is resource intensive and prone to inter observer variability. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer automated feature learning directly from raw brightfield images. Here, we evaluate ResNet50 and DenseNet121 on a curated dataset of 2,931 bright-field transmission optical microscopy images of thin brain tissue, split into 1,996 for training, 437 for validation, and 498 for testing. Our two stage transfer learning protocol involves initial training of a classifier head on frozen pretrained feature extractors, followed by fine tuning of deeper convolutional blocks with extensive data augmentation (rotations, flips, intensity jitter) and early stopping. DenseNet121 achieves 88.35 percent test accuracy, 0.9614 precision, 0.8667 recall, and 0.9116 F1 score the best performance compared to ResNet50 (82.12 percent, 0.9035, 0.8142, 0.8563). Detailed analysis of confusion matrices, training and validation curves, and classwise prediction distributions illustrates robust convergence and minimal bias. These findings demonstrate the superior generalization of dense connectivity on limited medical datasets and outline future directions for multi-class tumor grading and clinical translation.</description>

      <title>OpenPros: A Large-Scale Dataset for Limited View Prostate Ultrasound Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers among men, making its early detection critically important. Although ultrasound imaging offers greater accessibility and cost-effectiveness compared to MRI, traditional transrectal ultrasound methods suffer from low sensitivity, especially in detecting anteriorly located tumors. Ultrasound computed tomography provides quantitative tissue characterization, but its clinical implementation faces significant challenges, particularly under anatomically constrained limited-angle acquisition conditions specific to prostate imaging. To address these unmet needs, we introduce OpenPros, the first large-scale benchmark dataset explicitly developed for limited-view prostate USCT. Our dataset includes over 280,000 paired samples of realistic 2D speed-of-sound (SOS) phantoms and corresponding ultrasound full-waveform data, generated from anatomically accurate 3D digital prostate models derived from real clinical MRI/CT scans and ex vivo ultrasound measurements, annotated by medical experts. Simulations are conducted under clinically realistic configurations using advanced finite-difference time-domain and Runge-Kutta acoustic wave solvers, both provided as open-source components. Through comprehensive baseline experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep learning methods surpass traditional physics-based approaches in both inference efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Nevertheless, current deep learning models still fall short of delivering clinically acceptable high-resolution images with sufficient accuracy. By publicly releasing OpenPros, we aim to encourage the development of advanced machine learning algorithms capable of bridging this performance gap and producing clinically usable, high-resolution, and highly accurate prostate ultrasound images. The dataset is publicly accessible at https://open-pros.github.io/.</description>

      <title>A Reduced-Order CFD Approach for Intermediate grade Coronary Arterial Clinical Parameter Assessment A Reduced-Order CFD Approach for Intermediate grade Coronary Arterial Clinical Parameter Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a top reason of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a novel approach by integrating patient-specific Multi-slice CT scans into CAD models and employing a one-dimensional numerical framework to assess varying degrees of stenosis. The computational analysis encompasses the entire arterial tree, with a particular focus on stenosed coronary arteries modelled using an analytical equation. One-dimensional characteristic equations, utilizing forward and backward characteristic variables, are used to derive essential parameters such as area and velocity. A model based on resistance with reflection coefficient set to zero and realistic pressure waveform input is applied at the outflow and inflow respectively. Boundary conditions generated from the 1D model, capturing global characteristics, are subsequently used to simulate a 2D axisymmetric model, which captures local characteristics. The numerical solvers are validated against literature results, ensuring grid independence. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) are calculated using various non-Newtonian models across different severities for higher order model. Additionally, the role of lesion length in stenosed coronary arteries is investigated. Numerical simulations are performed over one cardiac cycle, covering both systole and diastole phases. The results demonstrate that FFR and iFR decrease with increasing stenosis severity. This method provides a reliable and non-invasive diagnostic tool for evaluating the functional severity of coronary artery stenosis in clinical settings, effectively capturing both global and local hemodynamic characteristics.</description>

      <title>SMURF: Scalable method for unsupervised reconstruction of flow in 4D flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SMURF, a scalable and unsupervised machine learning method for simultaneously segmenting vascular geometries and reconstructing velocity fields from 4D flow MRI data. SMURF models geometry and velocity fields using multilayer perceptron-based functions incorporating Fourier feature embeddings and random weight factorization to accelerate convergence. A measurement model connects these fields to the observed image magnitude and phase data. Maximum likelihood estimation and subsampling enable SMURF to process high-dimensional datasets efficiently. Evaluations on synthetic, in vitro, and in vivo datasets demonstrate SMURF's performance. On synthetic internal carotid artery aneurysm data derived from CFD, SMURF achieves a quarter-voxel segmentation accuracy across noise levels of up to 50%, outperforming the state-of-the-art segmentation method by up to double the accuracy. In an in vitro experiment on Poiseuille flow, SMURF reduces velocity reconstruction RMSE by approximately 34% compared to raw measurements. In in vivo internal carotid artery aneurysm data, SMURF attains nearly half-voxel segmentation accuracy relative to expert annotations and decreases median velocity divergence residuals by about 31%, with a 27% reduction in the interquartile range. These results indicate that SMURF is robust to noise, preserves flow structure, and identifies patient-specific morphological features. SMURF advances 4D flow MRI accuracy, potentially enhancing the diagnostic utility of 4D flow MRI in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>A flexible approach for fat-water separation with bipolar readouts and correction of gradient-induced phase and amplitude effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a fat-water separation approach that corrects bipolar readout gradient induced effects, without additional scans, that is compatible with any fat-water separation method. Theory and Methods: The proposed approach combines joint fat-water separation of the odd and even echoes of a bipolar multi-echo gradient echo acquisition with an inverse problem to find least-squares estimates for phase and amplitude corrections to eliminate bipolar-induced effects. Optimization of sequence parameter selection through the calculation of the number of signal averages (NSA) with Cram\'er-Rao Bound theory (CRB) is presented. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a graph cut optimization and further characterization of the accuracy was performed via Monte Carlo Simulations (MC). The proposed approach was tested in phantoms and in vivo. Proton density fat fraction maps (PDFF) were evaluated to quantify performance. Results: NSA calculations suggest short TE1 and {\Delta}TE=1.5 ms as optimal alternatives for fat-water separation. MC simulations demonstrated accurate estimation of fat and water complex signals, {\psi}, and R_2^* with mean relative error within 1%. In phantoms and in vivo, the proposed approach effectively eliminated effects induced by bipolar readout gradients, improving the outcome of the fat-water separation. Conclusion: We proposed an approach to correct bipolar readout-induced effects that are detrimental for fat-water separation. This approach can extend the use of existing fat-water separation techniques designed for data acquired using unipolar readout gradients to data collected with bipolar readout gradients.</description>

      <title>Output correction factors in a 1.5 T magnetic field determined at the central axis and at the lateral dose maximum for five detectors using alanine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent literature, the output correction factor in a 1.5T magnetic field, kB,Q,Clin, were determined only for the central axis (CAX), including our last work. At an MR-linac, the determination of the CAX position relies on e.g. MV-imaging and is at small field sizes located at the penumbra, whereas the maximum of the lateral profile (MAX) position is directly measurable. This study determined kB,Q,Ratio - the influence of the magnetic field on the output correction factor without a magnetic field, kQ,Clin - and kB,Q,Clin for both CAX and MAX fully experimentally for two MR-optimized ionization chambers, their conventional counterparts, and a solid-state detector. Additionally, the uncertainty due to intra-type variation for tabulated kB,Q,Clin was estimated. Measurements were conducted using an experimental setup consisting of a mobile electromagnet positioned in front of a standard clinical linac (6MV, 1.5T). Intra-type variation for the solid-state detector was assessed using 4 detectors. The change of absorbed dose to water was determined with alanine. Within the uncertainty, no difference in kB,Q,Ratio was observed between the MR-optimized chambers and their conventional counterparts. For the solid-state detector, no difference between CAX and MAX was observed. For all detectors, kB,Q,Clin remained constant down to a field size of 2.5x2.5cm2. At smaller field sizes, for MAX and for all detectors, kB,Q,Ratio decreased linearly. The maximum intra-type variation standard uncertainty was 0.009 for the smallest field size, with and without a magnetic field. In summary, kB,Q,Ratio and kB,Q,Clin, including its uncertainty, was successfully determined for five detectors at both CAX and MAX. For ionization chambers, kB,Q,Clin is lower at MAX, whereas for the solid-state detector, it remains the same. For the tabulated correction factors uncertainty, intra-type variation must be considered.</description>
