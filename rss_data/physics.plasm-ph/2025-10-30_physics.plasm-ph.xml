      <title>Cold atmospheric microplasma jet-water interactions: physicochemical analysis and growth effects in flowering plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are non-equilibrium plasmas, that are capable of producing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) at near-room temperature. Their interaction with water leads to the formation of plasma-activated water (PAW), whose chemical activity depends on discharge conditions. In this work, a helium-air (14:1) micro-plasma jet operated in a ring-to-ring electrode configuration is used to generate PAW and study its influence on the growth of Chrysanthemum saplings. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) confirms the presence of $N_2$ bands and He lines, with the He-air mixture providing more chemically active discharge (in terms of favoring the generation of nitrates in PAW) as compared to pure helium. The physicochemical characteristics of PAW such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and total dissolved solids (TDS) are analyzed as a function of plasma treatment time and water volume. The optimum condition for PAW generation is found to be 12 ml of de-ionized (DI) water treated for 40 minutes, which yields the highest ORP and nitrate concentration with a reduced pH. Comparative growth experiments over two weeks show that PAW-treated Chrysanthemum saplings exhibit significantly greater height (10.2 cm) and soil fertility (2580 $\mu$S/cm) than those watered with same amount of DI water or tap water. The results highlight the potential of PAW for sustainable enhancement of growth of flowering plants.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Line Chaos, Cantori, and Turnstiles in Toroidal Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although magnetic field line chaos, cantori, and turnstiles underlie the physics of tokamak disruptions, runaway electron damage, stellarator non-resonant divertors, and the most important electromagnetic correction to what are called electrostatic micro-instabilities, these concepts are not well known. These concepts will be defined and applications that illustrate their importance will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Robust direct laser acceleration of electrons with flying-focus laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct laser acceleration (DLA) offers a compact source of high-charge, energetic electrons for generating secondary radiation or neutrons. While DLA in high-density plasma optimizes the energy transfer from a laser pulse to electrons, it exacerbates nonlinear propagation effects, such as filamentation, that can disrupt the acceleration process. Here, we show that superluminal flying-focus pulses (FFPs) mitigate nonlinear propagation, thereby enhancing the number of high-energy electrons and resulting x-ray yield. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that, compared to a Gaussian pulse of equal energy (1 J) and intensity (2x10^20 W/cm^2), an FFP produces 80x more electrons above 100 MeV, increases the electron cutoff energy by 20%, triples the high-energy x-ray yield, and improves x-ray collimation. These results illustrate the ability of spatiotemporally structured laser pulses to provide additional control in the highly nonlinear, relativistic regime of laser-plasma interactions.</description>

      <title>Global Non-Axisymmetric Hall Instabilities in a Rotating Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-axisymmetric, flow-driven instabilities in the incompressible Hall-MHD model are studied in a differentially rotating cylindrical plasma. It is found that in the Hall-MHD regime, both whistler waves and ion-cyclotron waves can extract energy from the flow shear, resulting in two distinct branches of global instability. The non-axisymmetric whistler modes grow significantly faster than non-axisymmetric, ideal MHD modes. A discussion of the whistler instability mechanism is presented in the large-ion-skin-depth, `electron-MHD' limit. It is observed that the effect of the Hall term on the non-axisymmetric modes can be appreciable when $d_i$ is on the order of a few % of the width of the cylindrical annulus. Distinct global modes emerge in the Hall-MHD regime at significantly stronger magnetic fields than those required for unstable global MHD modes.</description>

      <title>Accurate Reporting of Ion Time-of-Flight during HiPIMS with Gated Front-End Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) deposited films can often improve through the effective use of metal-ion acceleration, requiring precise measurements of time-of-flight (ToF). These measurements are commonly done using time- and energy-resolved mass spectrometry but require careful consideration of the transit time of ions inside. The transit time is typically calculated by considering the travel length in various parts of the spectrometer (e.g. from orifice to detector), but errors associated with these estimations can lead to nonphysical values in a HiPIMS process (e.g. negative ToFs). Here we report a practical approach to determine ion ToF experimentally, using a bipolar HiPIMS power supply to synchronize a gating pulse to the front-end of a HIDEN Analytical EQP-300 mass spectrometer, placed at the working distance. The ToF is measured by applying a +70 V bias to repel ions, and a 5 us gating pulse of 0 V to accept them. To prevent interference with the HiPIMS plasma, a grounded shield is placed in front of the mass-spec head with a variable slit-opening (0.5-3 mm). The effectiveness of the shielding is verified by Langmuir probe measurements, noting negligible shifts in plasma potential for a DC sputter discharge. The gate is then synchronized to a HiPIMS pulse and data collected at 5 us intervals by adjusting the pulse delay. Measurements of the time-of-flights of Ar+, Al+, Sc+, Y+, and W+ ions are presented; Al+ and Ar+ ions were also compared to ToF calculated using mass spectrometry flight tube equations.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian Adaptive Rank (SLAR) Method for High-Dimensional Vlasov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a semi-Lagrangian adaptive rank (SLAR) integrator, in the finite difference framework for nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems, to the general high-order tensor setting. The proposed scheme retains the high-order accuracy of semi-Lagrangian methods, ensuring stability for large time steps and avoiding dimensional splitting errors. The primary contribution of this paper is the novel extension of the algorithm from the matrix to the high-dimensional tensor setting, which enables the simulation of Vlasov models in up to six dimensions. The key technical components include (1) a third-order high-dimensional polynomial reconstruction that scales as $O(d^2)$, providing a point-wise approximation of the solution at the foot of characteristics in a semi-Lagrangian scheme; (2) a recursive hierarchical adaptive cross approximation of high-order tensors in a hierarchical Tucker format, characterized by a tensor tree; (3) a low-complexity Poisson solver in the hierarchical Tucker format that leverages the FFT for efficiency. The computed adaptive rank kinetic solutions exhibit low-rank structures within branches of the tensor tree resulting in substantial computational savings in both storage and time. The resulting algorithm achieves a computational complexity of $O(d^4 N r^{3+\lceil\log_2d\rceil})$, where $N$ is the number of grid points per dimension, $d$ is the problem dimension, and $r$ is the maximum rank in the tensor tree, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Through extensive numerical tests, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and highlight its ability to capture complex solution structures while maintaining a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N$.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Relationship between Magnetic Anisotropy and Mode Composition in Low-$\beta$ Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this Letter, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using Cluster spacecraft measurements. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfv\'en and compressible modes, we reveal that the anisotropy is strongly mode dependent: quasi-parallel (`slab') energy contains both Alfv\'en and compressible modes, whereas quasi-perpendicular (`two-dimensional'; 2D) energy is almost purely Alfv\'enic, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. These findings elucidate the physical origin of the long-standing `slab+2D' empirical model and offer a new perspective on the turbulence cascade across the full three-dimensional wavevector space.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal control of laser intensity using differentiable programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical techniques for spatiotemporal control can produce laser pulses with custom amplitude, phase, or polarization structure. In nonlinear optics and plasma physics, the use of structured pulses typically follows a forward design approach, in which the efficacy of a known structure is analyzed for a particular application. Inverse approaches, in contrast, enable the discovery of new structures with the potential for superior performance. Here, an implementation of the unidirectional pulse propagation equation that supports automatic differentiation is combined with gradient-based optimization to design structured pulses with features that are advantageous for a range of nonlinear optical and plasma-based applications: (1) a longitudinally uniform intensity over an extended region, (2) a superluminal intensity peak that travels many Rayleigh ranges with constant duration, spot size, and amplitude, and (3) a laser pulse that ionizes a gas to form a uniform column of plasma. In the final case, optimizing the full spatiotemporal structure improves the performance by a factor of 15 compared to optimizing only spatial or only temporal structure, highlighting the advantage of spatiotemporal control.</description>

      <title>Effect of flow-aligned external magnetic fields on mushroom instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mushroom instability (MI) is a shear instability considered responsible for generating and amplifying magnetic fields in relativistic jets. While astrophysical jets are usually magnetized, how MI acts in magnetized jets remains poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a flow-aligned external magnetic field on MI, with both theoretical analyses and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In the limit of a cold and collisionless plasma, we derive a generalized dispersion relation for linear growth rates of the magnetized MIs. Numerical solutions of the dispersion relation reveal that the external magnetic field always suppresses the growth of MI, though MIs are much more robust against the external magnetic field than electron-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (ESKHIs). Analyses are also extended to instabilities with an arbitrary wavevector in the shear interface plane, where coupling effect is observed for sub-relativistic scenarios. Two-dimensional PIC simulations of single-mode MIs reach a good agreement with our analytical predictions, and we observe formation of a quasi-steady saturation structure in magnetized runs. In simulations with finite temperatures, we observe the competition and cooperation between MIs and a diffusion-induced DC magnetic field.</description>
