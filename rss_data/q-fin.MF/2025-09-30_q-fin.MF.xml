      <title>The Price of Liquidity: Implied Volatility of Automated Market Maker Fees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automated market maker (AMM) provides a method for creating a decentralized exchange on the blockchain. For this purpose, individual investors lend liquidity to the AMM pool in exchange for a stream of fees earned from its operations as a market maker. Within this work, we reinterpret the loss-versus-rebalancing as the implied fee stream generated by an AMM so that a risk-neutral investor is indifferent in the decision of providing liquidity. With this implied fee structure, we propose a novel fixed-for-floating swap on the fees generated by an AMM in order to quote the implied volatilities and implied correlations of digital assets. We apply this theory to realized fees in different markets to empirically validate the relevance of the deduced fee-based volatility.</description>

      <title>When risk defies order: On the limits of fractional stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on monotone additive statistics and questions regarding optimal risk sharing for return-based risk measures, we investigate the existence, structure, and applications of Meyer risk measures. Those are monetary risk measures consistent with fractional stochastic orders suggested by Meyer (1977a,b) as refinement of second-order stochastic dominance (SSD). These so-called $v$-SD orders are based on a threshold utility function $v$. The test utilities defining the associated order are those at least as risk averse in absolute terms as $v$. The generality of $v$ allows to subsume SSD and other examples from the literature. The structure of risk measures respecting the $v$-SD order is clarified by two types of representations. The existence of nontrivial examples is more subtle: for many choices of $v$ outside the exponential (CARA) class, they do not exist. Additional properties like convexity or positive homogeneity further restrict admissible examples, even within the CARA class. We present impossibility theorems that demonstrate a deeper link between the axiomatic structure of monetary risk measures and SSD than previously acknowledged. The study concludes with two applications: portfolio optimisation under a Meyer risk measure as objective, and risk assessment of financial time series data.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning for Asset-Liability Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic (LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning, we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without learning the environment.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector overlaps of sample covariance matrices with intersecting time periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute exactly the overlap between the eigenvectors of two large empirical covariance ma- trices computed over intersecting time intervals, generalizing the results obtained previously for non-intersecting intervals. Our method relies on a particular form of Girko linearisation and ex- tended local laws. We check our results numerically and apply them to financial data.</description>

      <title>Risk-indifference Pricing of American-style Contingent Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the pricing of contingent claims of American style, using indifference pricing by fully dynamic convex risk measures. We provide a general definition of risk-indifference prices for buyers and sellers in continuous time, in a setting where buyer and seller have potentially different information, and show that these definitions are consistent with no-arbitrage principles. Specifying to stochastic volatility models, we characterize indifference prices via solutions of Backward Stochastic Differential Equations reflected at Backward Stochastic Differential Equations and show that this characterization provides a basis for the implementation of numerical methods using deep learning.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and Law-of-large numbers for the Volterra Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Volterra Volterra Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process on $\mathbb{R}_+$ and its stationary version. Based on a fine asymptotic analysis of the corresponding Volterra Riccati equation combined with the affine transformation formula, we first show that the finite-dimensional distributions of this process are asymptotically independent. Afterwards, we prove a law-of-large numbers in $L^p$(\Omega)$ with $p \geq 2$ and show that the stationary process is ergodic. As an application, we prove the consistency of the method of moments and study the maximum-likelihood estimation for continuous and discrete high-frequency observations.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in Bitcoin Realised Volatility: Implications for Rough Volatility Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the applicability of rough volatility models to Bitcoin realized volatility using the normalised p-variation framework of Cont and Das (2024). Applying this model-free estimator to high-frequency Bitcoin data from 2017 to 2024 across multiple sampling resolutions, we find that the normalised statistic remains strictly negative, precluding the estimation of a valid roughness index. Stationarity tests and robustness checks reveal no significant evidence of non-stationarity or structural breaks as explanatory factors. Instead, convergent evidence from three complementary diagnostics, namely Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, log-log moment scaling, and wavelet leaders, reveals a multifractal structure in Bitcoin volatility. This behaviour violates the homogeneity assumptions underlying rough volatility estimation and accounts for the estimator's systematic failure. These findings suggest that while rough volatility models perform well in traditional markets, they are structurally misaligned with the empirical features of Bitcoin volatility.</description>
