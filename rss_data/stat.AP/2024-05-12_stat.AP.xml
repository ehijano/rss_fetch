      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Sample Entropy Hyperparameters for Short Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the complexity and irregularity of time series data is a primary pursuit across various data-scientific disciplines. Sample entropy (SampEn) is a widely adopted metric for this purpose, but its reliability is sensitive to the choice of its hyperparameters, the embedding dimension $(m)$ and the similarity radius $(r)$, especially for short-duration signals. This paper presents a novel methodology that addresses this challenge. We introduce a Bayesian optimization framework, integrated with a bootstrap-based variance estimator tailored for short signals, to simultaneously and optimally select the values of $m$ and $r$ for reliable SampEn estimation. Through validation on synthetic signal experiments, our approach outperformed existing benchmarks. It achieved a 60 to 90% reduction in relative error for estimating SampEn variance and a 22 to 45% decrease in relative mean squared error for SampEn estimation itself ($p \leq 0.043$). Applying our method to publicly available short-signal benchmarks yielded promising results. Unlike existing competitors, our approach was the only one to successfully identify known entropy differences across all signal sets ($p \leq 0.042$). Additionally, we introduce "EristroPy," an open-source Python package that implements our proposed optimization framework for SampEn hyperparameter selection. This work holds potential for applications where accurate estimation of entropy from short-duration signals is paramount.</description>

      <title>Inferring Skin-Brain-Skin Connections from Infodemiology Data using Dynamic Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between skin diseases and mental illnesses has been extensively studied using cross-sectional epidemiological data. Typically, such data can only measure association (rather than causation) and include only a subset of the diseases we may be interested in. In this paper, we complement the evidence from such analyses by learning an overarching causal network model over twelve health conditions from the Google Search Trends Symptoms public data set.
  We learned the causal network model using a dynamic Bayesian network, which can represent both cyclic and acyclic causal relationships, is easy to interpret and accounts for the spatio-temporal trends in the data in a probabilistically rigorous way. The causal network confirms a large number of cyclic relationships between the selected health conditions and the interplay between skin and mental diseases. For acne, we observe a cyclic relationship with anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and an indirect relationship with depression through sleep disorders. For dermatitis, we observe directed links to anxiety, depression and sleep disorders and a cyclic relationship with ADHD. We also observe a link between dermatitis and ADHD and a cyclic relationship between acne and ADHD. Furthermore, the network includes several direct connections between sleep disorders and other health conditions, highlighting the impact of the former on the overall health and well-being of the patient.
  Mapping disease interplay, indirect relationships, and the key role of mediators, such as sleep disorders, will allow healthcare professionals to address disease management holistically and more effectively. Even if we consider all skin and mental diseases jointly, each disease subnetwork is unique, allowing for more targeted interventions.</description>

      <title>Sampling the Swadesh List to Identify Similar Languages with Tree Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication plays a vital role in human interaction. Studying language is a worthwhile task and more recently has become quantitative in nature with developments of fields like quantitative comparative linguistics and lexicostatistics. With respect to the authors own native languages, the ancestry of the English language and the Latin alphabet are of the primary interest. The Indo-European Tree traces many modern languages back to the Proto-Indo-European root. Swadesh's cognates played a large role in developing that historical perspective where some of the primary branches are Germanic, Celtic, Italic, and Balto-Slavic. This paper will use data analysis on open books where the simplest singular space is the 3-spider - a union T3 of three rays with their endpoints glued at a point 0 - which can represent these tree spaces for language clustering. These trees are built using a single linkage method for clustering based on distances between samples from languages which use the Latin Script. Taking three languages at a time, the barycenter is determined. Some initial results have found both non-sticky and sticky sample means. If the mean exhibits non-sticky properties, then one language may come from a different ancestor than the other two. If the mean is considered sticky, then the languages may share a common ancestor or all languages may have different ancestry.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Acceleration of SN Ia Photometric Distance Estimation with BayeSN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standarizable candles whose observed light curves can be used to infer their distances, which can in turn be used in cosmological analyses. As the quantity of observed SNe Ia grows with current and upcoming surveys, increasingly scalable analyses are necessary to take full advantage of these new datasets for precise estimation of cosmological parameters. Bayesian inference methods enable fitting SN Ia light curves with robust uncertainty quantification, but traditional posterior sampling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is computationally expensive. We present an implementation of variational inference (VI) to accelerate the fitting of SN Ia light curves using the BayeSN hierarchical Bayesian model for time-varying SN Ia spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We demonstrate and evaluate its performance on both simulated light curves and data from the Foundation Supernova Survey with two different forms of surrogate posterior -- a multivariate normal and a custom multivariate zero-lower-truncated normal distribution -- and compare them with the Laplace Approximation and full MCMC analysis. To validate of our variational approximation, we calculate the pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) diagnostic, and perform variational simulation-based calibration (VSBC). The VI approximation achieves similar results to MCMC but with an order-of-magnitude speedup for the inference of the photometric distance moduli. Overall, we show that VI is a promising method for scalable parameter inference that enables analysis of larger datasets for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Residual Useful Lifetime Prediction for Assets with Uncertain Failure Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial prognostics focuses on utilizing degradation signals to forecast and continually update the residual useful life of complex engineering systems. However, existing prognostic models for systems with multiple failure modes face several challenges in real-world applications, including overlapping degradation signals from multiple components, the presence of unlabeled historical data, and the similarity of signals across different failure modes. To tackle these issues, this research introduces two prognostic models that integrate the mixture (log)-location-scale distribution with deep learning. This integration facilitates the modeling of overlapping degradation signals, eliminates the need for explicit failure mode identification, and utilizes deep learning to capture complex nonlinear relationships between degradation signals and residual useful lifetimes. Numerical studies validate the superior performance of these proposed models compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Separating States in Astronomical Sources Using Hidden Markov Models: With a Case Study of Flaring and Quiescence on EV Lac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to distinguish between different states (e.g., high and low, quiescent and flaring) in astronomical sources with count data. The method models the underlying physical process as latent variables following a continuous-space Markov chain that determines the expected Poisson counts in observed light curves in multiple passbands. For the underlying state process, we consider several autoregressive processes, yielding continuous-space hidden Markov models of varying complexity. Under these models, we can infer the state that the object is in at any given time. The state predictions from these models are then dichotomized with the help of a finite-mixture model to produce state classifications. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the active dMe flare star EV Lac, splitting the data into quiescent and flaring states. We find that a first-order vector autoregressive process efficiently separates flaring from quiescence: flaring occurs over 30-40% of the observation durations, a well-defined persistent quiescent state can be identified, and the flaring state is characterized by higher temperatures and emission measures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book chapter emphasizes the significance of categorical raster data in ecological studies, specifically land use or land cover (LULC) data, and highlights the pivotal role of landscape metrics and pattern-based spatial analysis in comprehending environmental patterns and their dynamics. It explores the usage of R packages, particularly landscapemetrics and motif, for quantifying and analyzing landscape patterns using LULC data from three distinct European regions. It showcases the computation, visualization, and comparison of landscape metrics, while also addressing additional features such as patch value extraction, sub-region sampling, and moving window computation. Furthermore, the chapter delves into the intricacies of pattern-based spatial analysis, explaining how spatial signatures are computed and how the motif package facilitates comparisons and clustering of landscape patterns. The chapter concludes by discussing the potential of customization and expansion of the presented tools.</description>

Abstract: The hot-hand theory posits that an athlete who has performed well in the recent past performs better in the present. We use multilevel logistic regression to test this theory for National Hockey League playoff goaltenders, controlling for a variety of shot-related and game-related characteristics. Our data consists of 48,431 shots for 93 goaltenders in the 2008-2016 playoffs. Using a wide range of shot-based windows to quantify recent save performance, we find no evidence for the hot-hand theory, and some evidence that good recent save performance negatively impacts the next-shot save probability. We use a permutation test to rule out a regression to the mean explanation for our findings.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Model Fit Evaluation in SEM: Practical Tips for Optimizing Chi-Square Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper underscores the vital role of the chi-square test within political science research utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM). The ongoing debate regarding the inclusion of chi-square test statistics alongside fit indices in result presentations has sparked controversy. Despite the recognized limitations of relying solely on the chi-square test, its judicious application can enhance its effectiveness in evaluating model fit and specification. To exemplify this, we present three common scenarios pertinent to political science research where fit indices may inadequately address goodness-of-fit concerns, while the chi-square statistic can be effectively harnessed. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we examine strategies for enhancing chi-square tests within these scenarios, showcasing the potential of appropriately employed chi-square tests to provide a comprehensive model fit assessment. Our recommendation is to report both the chi-square test and fit indices, with a priority on precise model specification to ensure the trustworthiness of model fit indicators.</description>

      <title>Forecasting high-dimensional functional time series with dual-factor structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dual-factor model for high-dimensional functional time series (HDFTS) that considers multiple populations. The HDFTS is first decomposed into a collection of functional time series (FTS) in a lower dimension and a group of population-specific basis functions. The system of basis functions describes cross-sectional heterogeneity, while the reduced-dimension FTS retains most of the information common to multiple populations. The low-dimensional FTS is further decomposed into a product of common functional loadings and a matrix-valued time series that contains the most temporal dynamics embedded in the original HDFTS. The proposed general-form dual-factor structure is connected to several commonly used functional factor models. We demonstrate the finite-sample performances of the proposed method in recovering cross-sectional basis functions and extracting common features using simulated HDFTS. An empirical study shows that the proposed model produces more accurate point and interval forecasts for subnational age-specific mortality rates in Japan. The financial benefits associated with the improved mortality forecasts are translated into a life annuity pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>A statistical reconstruction algorithm for positronium lifetime imaging using time-of-flight positron emission tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06463v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important modality for diagnosing diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease, capable of revealing the uptake of radiolabeled molecules that target specific pathological markers of the diseases. Recently, positronium lifetime imaging (PLI) that adds to traditional PET the ability to explore properties of the tissue microenvironment beyond tracer uptake has been demonstrated with time-of-flight (TOF) PET and the use of non-pure positron emitters. However, achieving accurate reconstruction of lifetime images from data acquired by systems having a finite TOF resolution still presents a challenge. This paper focuses on the two-dimensional PLI, introducing a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method that employs an exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) probability distribution that describes the positronium lifetime data produced by TOF PET. We evaluate the performance of our EMG-based MLE method against \st{traditional} approaches using exponential likelihood functions and penalized surrogate methods. Results from computer-simulated data reveal that the proposed EMG-MLE method can yield quantitatively accurate lifetime images. We also demonstrate that the proposed MLE formulation can be extended to handle PLI data containing multiple positron populations.</description>

      <title>When Respondents Don't Care Anymore: Identifying the Onset of Careless Responding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Questionnaires in the behavioral and organizational sciences tend to be lengthy: survey measures comprising hundreds of items are the norm rather than the exception. However, literature suggests that the longer a questionnaire takes, the higher the probability that participants lose interest and start responding carelessly. Consequently, in long surveys a large number of participants may engage in careless responding, posing a major threat to internal validity. We propose a novel method for identifying the onset of careless responding (or an absence thereof) for each participant. It is based on combined measurements of multiple dimensions in which carelessness may manifest, such as inconsistency and invariability. Since a structural break in either dimension is potentially indicative of carelessness, the proposed method searches for evidence for changepoints along the combined measurements. It is highly flexible, based on machine learning, and provides statistical guarantees on its performance. An empirical application on data from a seminal study on the incidence of careless responding reveals that the reported incidence has likely been substantially underestimated due to the presence of respondents that were careless for only parts of the questionnaire. In simulation experiments, we find that the proposed method achieves high reliability in correctly identifying carelessness onset, discriminates well between careless and attentive respondents, and captures a variety of careless response types, even when a large number of careless respondents are present. Furthermore, we provide freely available open source software to enhance accessibility and facilitate adoption by empirical researchers.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound with an Application to Covariance Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new performance bound for estimation problems where the parameter to estimate lies in a Riemannian manifold (a smooth manifold endowed with a Riemannian metric) and follows a given prior distribution. In this setup, the chosen Riemannian metric induces a geometry for the parameter manifold, as well as an intrinsic notion of the estimation error measure. Performance bound for such error measure were previously obtained in the non-Bayesian case (when the unknown parameter is assumed to deterministic), and referred to as \textit{intrinsic} Cram\'er-Rao bound. The presented result then appears either as: \textit{a}) an extension of the intrinsic Cram\'er-Rao bound to the Bayesian estimation framework; \textit{b}) a generalization of the Van-Trees inequality (Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound) that accounts for the aforementioned geometric structures. In a second part, we leverage this formalism to study the problem of covariance matrix estimation when the data follow a Gaussian distribution, and whose covariance matrix is drawn from an inverse Wishart distribution. Performance bounds for this problem are obtained for both the mean squared error (Euclidean metric) and the natural Riemannian distance for Hermitian positive definite matrices (affine invariant metric). Numerical simulation illustrate that assessing the error with the affine invariant metric is revealing of interesting properties of the maximum a posteriori and minimum mean square error estimator, which are not observed when using the Euclidean metric.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Active/Inactive Patterns in the NHANES Data using Generalized Multilevel Functional Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Between 2011 and 2014 NHANES collected objectively measured physical activity data using wrist-worn accelerometers for tens of thousands of individuals for up to seven days. Here we analyze the minute-level indicators of being active, which can be viewed as binary (because there is an active indicator at every minute), multilevel (because there are multiple days of data for each study participant), functional (because within-day data can be viewed as a function of time) data. To extract within- and between-participant directions of variation in the data, we introduce Generalized Multilevel Functional Principal Component Analysis (GM-FPCA), an approach based on the dimension reduction of the linear predictor. Scores associated with specific patterns of activity are shown to be strongly associated with time to death. Extensive simulation studies indicate that GM-FPCA provides accurate estimation of model parameters, is computationally stable, and is scalable in the number of study participants, visits, and observations within visits. R code for implementing the method is provided.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic-Geometrical Framework for Object Pose Estimation based on Mixture Models Avoiding the Correspondence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18107v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Pose estimation of rigid objects is a practical challenge in optical metrology and computer vision. This paper presents a novel stochastic-geometrical modeling framework for object pose estimation based on observing multiple feature points.
  Methods: This framework utilizes mixture models for feature point densities in object space and for interpreting real measurements. Advantages are the avoidance to resolve individual feature correspondences and to incorporate correct stochastic dependencies in multi-view applications. First, the general modeling framework is presented, second, a general algorithm for pose estimation is derived, and third, two example models (camera and lateration setup) are presented.
  Results: Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of this modeling and general algorithm by presenting four simulation scenarios for three observation systems, including the dependence on measurement resolution, object deformations and measurement noise. Probabilistic modeling utilizing mixture models shows the potential for accurate and robust pose estimations while avoiding the correspondence problem.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel Attentional Scale Sequence Fusion based You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework (ASF-YOLO) which combines spatial and scale features for accurate and fast cell instance segmentation. Built on the YOLO segmentation framework, we employ the Scale Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) module to enhance the multi-scale information extraction capability of the network, and the Triple Feature Encoder (TFE) module to fuse feature maps of different scales to increase detailed information. We further introduce a Channel and Position Attention Mechanism (CPAM) to integrate both the SSFF and TPE modules, which focus on informative channels and spatial position-related small objects for improved detection and segmentation performance. Experimental validations on two cell datasets show remarkable segmentation accuracy and speed of the proposed ASF-YOLO model. It achieves a box mAP of 0.91, mask mAP of 0.887, and an inference speed of 47.3 FPS on the 2018 Data Science Bowl dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Balancing Specialization and Adaptation in a Transforming Scientific Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14040</link>

Abstract: How do scientists navigate between the need to capitalize on their prior knowledge through specialization, and the urge to adapt to evolving research opportunities? Drawing from diverse perspectives on adaptation, including cultural evolution, this paper proposes an unsupervised Bayesian approach motivated by Optimal Transport of the evolution of scientists' research portfolios in response to transformations in their field. The model relies on $186,162$ scientific abstracts and authorship data to evaluate the influence of intellectual, social, and institutional resources on scientists' trajectories within a cohort of $2\,195$ high-energy physicists between 2000 and 2019. Using Inverse Optimal Transport, the reallocation of research efforts is shown to be shaped by learning costs, thus enhancing the utility of the scientific capital disseminated among scientists. Two dimensions of social capital, namely "diversity" and "power", have opposite associations with the magnitude of change in scientists' research interests: while "diversity" disrupts and expands research interests, "power" is associated with more stable research agendas. Social capital plays a more crucial role in shifts between cognitively distant research areas. More generally, this work suggests new approaches for understanding, measuring and modeling collective adaptation using Optimal Transport.</description>
