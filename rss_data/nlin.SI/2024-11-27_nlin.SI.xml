      <title>Concentric-ring patterns of higher-order lumps in the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili I equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-time patterns of general higher-order lump solutions in the KP-I equation are investigated. It is shown that when the index vector of the general lump solution is a sequence of consecutive odd integers starting from one, the large-time pattern in the spatial $(x, y)$ plane generically would comprise fundamental lumps uniformly distributed on concentric rings. For other index vectors, the large-time pattern would comprise fundamental lumps in the outer region as described analytically by the nonzero-root structure of the associated Wronskian-Hermit polynomial, together with possible fundamental lumps in the inner region that are uniformly distributed on concentric rings generically. Leading-order predictions of fundamental lumps in these solution patterns are also derived. The predicted patterns at large times are compared to true solutions, and good agreement is observed.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014412}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.064313}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N&gt;12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>On the affine invariant of hypersemitoric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypersemitoric systems are a class of integrable systems on $4$-dimensional symplectic manifolds which only have mildly degenerate singularities and where one of the integrals induces an effective Hamiltonian $S^1$-action and is proper. We introduce the affine invariant of hypersemitoric systems, which is a generalization of the Delzant polytope of toric systems and the polytope invariant of semitoric systems. Along the way, we compute and plot this invariant for meaningful and more and more complicated examples.</description>

      <title>Remarks on intersection numbers and integrable hierarchies. II. Tau-structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For systems of evolutionary partial differential equations the tau-structure is an important notion which originated from the deep relation between integrable systems and quantum field theories. We show that, under a certain non-degeneracy condition, existence of a tau-structure implies integrability. As an example, we apply this principle to provide a new proof of the integrability of the Drinfeld--Sokolov hierarchy associated to an arbitrary Kac--Moody algebra and a choice of a vertex of its Dynkin diagram.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation and aspects of integrability of generalised hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalised Hydrodynamics (GHD) describes the large-scale inhomogeneous dynamics of integrable (or close to integrable) systems in one dimension of space, based on a central equation for the fluid density or quasi-particle density: the GHD equation. We consider a new, general form of the GHD equation: we allow for spatially extended interaction kernels, generalising previous constructions. We show that the GHD equation, in our general form and hence also in its conventional form, is Hamiltonian. This holds also including force terms representing inhomogeneous external potentials coupled to conserved densities. To this end, we introduce a new Poisson bracket on functionals of the fluid density, which is seen as our dynamical field variable. The total energy is the Hamiltonian whose flow under this Poisson bracket generates the GHD equation. The fluid density depends on two (real and spectral) variables so the GHD equation can be seen as a $2+1$-dimensional classical field theory. In its $1+1$-dimensional reduction corresponding to the case without external forces, we further show the system admits an infinite set of conserved quantities that are in involution for our Poisson bracket, hinting at integrability of this field theory.</description>
