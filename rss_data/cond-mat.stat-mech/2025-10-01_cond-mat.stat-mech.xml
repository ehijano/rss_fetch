      <title>Diffusion with doubly stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion with stochastic resetting, instantaneous returns of a diffusing particle to a reference point, creates a stationary probability distribution. The paradigm is extended here to a doubly stochastic protocol in which the resetting rate itself fluctuates in time and relaxes on its own timescale. An exact steady-state solution reveals three spatial regimes: a fluctuation-dominated core near the origin, a power-law regime at intermediate distances, and a far-field exponential decay fixed by the rate-relaxation time. These results expose how the instantaneous rate, mean rate, and relaxation time come together to determine the non-equilibrium steady state.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations in SIS processes on regular random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In network-based SIS models of infectious disease transmission, infection can only occur between directly connected individuals. This constraint naturally gives rise to spatial correlations between the states of neighboring nodes, as the infection status of connected individuals becomes interdependent. Although mean-field approximations are commonly invoked to simplify disease forecasting on networks, they fail to account for these correlations by assuming that infectious individuals are well-mixed within a population, leading to inaccurate predictions of infection numbers over time. As such, the development of mathematical frameworks that account for spatially correlated infections is of great interest, as they offer a compromise between accurate disease forecasting and analytic tractability. Here, we use existing corrections to mean-field theory on the regular lattice to construct a more general framework for equivalent corrections on regular random graph topologies. We derive and simulate a system of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the spatial correlation function at various geodesic distances on random networks, and use solutions to this hierarchy of ordinary differential equations to predict the global infection density as a function of time, finding good agreement with corresponding numerical simulations. Our results constitute a substantial development on existing corrections to mean-field theory for infectious individuals in SIS processes and provide an in-depth characterization of how structural randomness in networks affects the dynamical trajectories of infectious diseases on networks.</description>

      <title>Scalable Boltzmann Generators for equilibrium sampling of large-scale materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian statistics of concentration fluctuations in free liquid diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the three-point skewness of concentration fluctuations is non-vanishing in free liquid diffusion, even in the limit of vanishingly small mean concentration gradients. We exploit a high-Schmidt reduction of nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz hydrodynamics for a binary fluid, both analytically and by a massively parallel Lagrangian Monte Carlo simulation. Non-Gaussian statistics result from nonlinear coupling of concentration fluctuations to thermal velocity fluctuations, analogous to the turbulent advection of a passive scalar. Concentration fluctuations obey no central limit theorem, counter to the predictions of macroscopic fluctuation theory for generic diffusive systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Thermodynamics Perspective into Nuclear Power Plant Heat Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear power plants are prominent examples of heat-to-work conversion systems, and optimizing their thermodynamic performance offers significant potential for enhancing energy efficiency. With a development history of less than a century, optimization trends in nuclear power plants indicate that classical thermodynamics alone may be insufficient, particularly when maximizing output power rather than efficiency becomes the primary focus. This paper re-examines nuclear power plant thermodynamic cycles through the lens of finite-time thermodynamics, an approach specifically developed to address the practical requirement of enhancing power output. Beginning with the simpler Brayton cycle without phase transitions, we obtain the famous Curzon-Ahlborn formula for efficiency at maximum power. Subsequently we analyze the more complex Rankine cycle, which incorporates phase transitions. By explicitly considering the working fluid undergoing phase transitions within the cycle, we uncover the inherent trade-off between output power and efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate that both the maximum attainable power and efficiency increase as latent heat rises. These findings shall provide insights and methodologies for future thermodynamic optimization of nuclear power plants and other Rankine-type cycle systems.</description>

      <title>Computing Large Deviations of First-Passage-Time Statistics in Open Quantum Systems: Two Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two methods for computing the large deviations of the first-passage-time statistics in general open quantum systems. The first method determines the region of convergence of the joint Laplace transform and the $z$-transform of the first-passage time distribution by solving an equation of poles with respect to the $z$-transform parameter. The scaled cumulant generating function is then obtained as the logarithm of the boundary values within this region. The theoretical basis lies in the facts that the dynamics of the open quantum systems can be unraveled into a piecewise deterministic process and there exists a tilted Liouville master equation in Hilbert space. The second method uses a simulation-based approach built on the wave function cloning algorithm. To validate both methods, we derive analytical expressions for the scaled cumulant generating functions in field-driven two-level and three-level systems. In addition, we present numerical results alongside cloning simulations for a field-driven system comprising two interacting two-level atoms.</description>

      <title>Classical Heisenberg and XY models on zigzag ladder lattices with nearest-neighbor bilinear-biquadratic exchange: Exact solution for the ground-state problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact and complete solution of the ground-state problem for the classical Heisenberg and XY models with nearest-neighbor bilinear-biquadratic exchange on two- and three-dimensional lattices composed of isosceles triangles is determined with the use of a cluster method. It is shown how the geometric frustration due to the presence of triangles as structural units leads to the emergence of a rich phase diagram with incommensurate spiral orderings and their collinear limits, as well as canted and noncoplanar (conical) structures. Surprisingly, there are two different spiral phases with both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions between them. One of these phases is degenerate on two-dimensional partially anisotropic triangular lattice. This degeneracy is lifted on three-dimensional lattices. Canted phase is highly degenerate and this degeneracy persists on three-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of Wavelet transform and Fourier domain filtering for medical image denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising of images is a crucial preprocessing step in medical imaging, essential for improving diagnostic clarity. While deep learning methods offer state-of-the-art performance, their computational complexity and data requirements can be prohibitive. In this study we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two classical, computationally efficient transform-domain techniques: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Fourier Cosine Transform (DFCT) filtering. We evaluated their efficacy in denoising medical images which corrupted by Gaussian, Uniform, Poisson, and Salt-and-Pepper noise. Contrary to the common hypothesis favoring wavelets for their multi-resolution capabilities, our results demonstrate that a block-based DFCT approach consistently and significantly outperforms a global DWT approach across all noise types and performance metrics (SNR, PSNR, IM). We attribute DFCT's superior performance to its localized processing strategy, which better preserves fine details by operating on small image blocks, effectively adapting to local statistics without introducing global artifacts. This finding underscores the importance of algorithmic selection based on processing methodology, not just transform properties, and positions DFCT as a highly effective and efficient denoising tool for practical medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As illustrated by Wigner, all symmetries forming a group structure (and hence invertible) must be either unitary or antiunitary. Relinquishing this assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Krylov Winding and Emergent Coherence in Operator Growth Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operator wavefunction provides a fine-grained description of quantum chaos and of the irreversible growth of simple operators into increasingly complex ones. Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a phase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called $\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a holographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator remains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body system. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related concept of $\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a phase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding is a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding under two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and size bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and (ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$ (with $\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\alpha$ the growth rate), which ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not saturate this bound, with $h = \lambda_L / 2\alpha &lt;1$, the winding with Pauli size $\ell$ becomes $\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\ell^{1/h}$. We illustrate these results with two microscopic models: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and a disordered $k$-local spin model.</description>

      <title>Limit shapes for Domain-Wall (colored) vertex models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study partition functions with domain-wall like boundary conditions for path models issued from colored vertex models. These models display an arctic phenomenon, as attested by numerical simulations. We show that the colored vertex model is equivalent to a certain single-color ``colorblind" vertex model. In a special case of the weights for the colorblind touching paths, we derive the arctic curve using a bijective sliding map to non-intersecting paths, for which arctic curves were previously derived using the tangent method. The resulting arctic curves are only piecewise analytic, as in the known non-free fermion cases of Six vertex model with domain-wall boundaries and its relatives. We also prove a shear phenomenon, that some portions of the arctic curve are sheared versions of the analytic continuation of other portions, as already observed in the uniformly weighted Six and Twenty vertex models.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Bosonic Systems at Thermal Equilibrium: Computational Complexity and Clustering of Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range systems, characterized by couplings that decay as a power law $r^{-\alpha}$, are of fundamental importance and attract widespread interest across diverse physical phenomena. Among these, bosonic systems are particularly significant due to their theoretical importance and experimental relevance. In this Letter, we propose a classical algorithm with a quasipolynomial runtime to efficiently approximate the partition function of long-range bosonic systems at high temperatures. For finite-range systems, the complexity improves to almost polynomial time. We also present a rigorous proof for the power-law decay of correlation functions. This property, known as clustering of correlation, is well-established for finite-range spin models. However, in sharp contrast, has remained largely unexplored for long-range bosonic systems. The results presented here address two long-standing gaps concerning the computational complexity and correlation clustering in such systems. The methodology we introduce provides new tools for future studies of challenging problems in statistical and quantum many-body physics concerning bosonic system and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Tracer diffusion coefficients in a sheared granular gas. Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26115v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of tracer particles immersed in a granular gas under uniform shear flow (USF) is analyzed within the framework of the inelastic Boltzmann equation. Two different but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results. First, we maintain the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator but consider inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). Using IMM allows us to compute the collisional moments of the Boltzmann operator without knowing the velocity distribution functions of the granular binary mixture explicitly. Second, we consider a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres (IHS). This kinetic model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of IHS. We solve the Boltzmann--Lorentz kinetic equation for tracer particles using a generalized Chapman--Enskog--like expansion around the shear flow distribution. This reference distribution retains all hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. The mass flux is obtained to first order in the deviations of the concentration, pressure, and temperature from their values in the reference state. Due to the velocity space anisotropy induced by the shear flow, the mass flux is expressed in terms of tensorial quantities rather than the conventional scalar diffusion coefficients. The exact results derived here are compared with those previously obtained for IHS by using different approximations [JSTAT P02012 (2007)]. The comparison generally shows reasonable quantitative agreement, especially for IMM results. Finally, we study segregation by thermal diffusion as an application of the theory. The phase diagrams illustrating segregation are shown and compared with IHS results, demonstrating qualitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration in a fast scrambling system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration -- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (cSYK) model with a conserved U(1) charge. Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity, identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism. These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path Integral for the Active Brownian Particle in a Harmonic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we develop and apply a path integral formulation for the microscopic degrees of freedom obeying stochastic differential equations to an active Brownian particle (ABP) trapped in a harmonic potential. The formalism allows to derive exact analytic expressions for the time-dependent moments, like the mean position and the mean square displacement, including full dependence on initial conditions. In addition, the probability distribution of the particle's position can be evaluated systematically as a series expansion in the propulsion speed. Compared to previous methods relying on eigenfunction expansions of the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation, our method is easier to generalize to more complex situations: it does not rely on eigenfunctions but on a reference state that can be solved analytically, which in our case is the passive Brownian particle in a harmonic potential. We exemplify this versatility by also briefly treating an ABP with an active torque (Brownian circle swimmer, BCS) in a harmonic potential.</description>

Abstract: Active matter has thrived in recent years, driven both by the insight that it underlies fundamental processes in nature, and by its vast potential for applications. This allows for innovation both inspired by experimental observations, and by construction of novel systems with desired properties. In this paper, we develop a novel system in the search for a new kind of pattern formation: microstructural motifs with orthogonal alignment. Taking a simple active Brownian particle (ABP) model applied to dumbbell-shaped particles, we add a quadrupolar interaction by positioning two antiparallel magnetic dipolar moments on each particle. We find that the phase behavior is determined by the competition between active motion and the orthogonal alignment favored by quadrupolar attraction. By varying these quantities, we are able to tune both the internal structure of the aggregates, and find a surprising stability of triangular aggregates, to the point of clusters of size $N=3$ being strongly overrepresented. Although none of the component particles are chiral, the resulting structures spin in a random, fixed direction due to combination of the polarity of the active motion. This results in an ensemble of windmilling (randomly spinning in a circular motion) aggregates with windmill-like shape (due to the three- or four core component dumbbells). Ultimately, this simple model shows an interesting range of microstructural motifs, with great potential for experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Long-range minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlocal conformal field theories in two dimensions which are obtained as deformations of the Virasoro minimal models. The construction proceeds by coupling a relevant primary operator $\phi_{r,s}$ of the $m$-th minimal model to a generalized free field, in such a way that the interaction term has scaling dimension $2-\delta$. Flowing to the infrared, we reach a new class of CFTs that we call long-range minimal models. In the case $r=s=2$, the resulting line of fixed points, parametrized by $\delta$, can be studied using two perturbative expansions with different regimes of validity, one near the mean-field theory end, and one close to the long-range to short-range crossover. This is due to a straightforward generalization of an infrared duality which was proposed for the long-range Ising model ($m = 3$) in 2017. We find that the large-$m$ limit is problematic in both perturbative regimes, hence nonperturbative methods will be required in the intermediate range for all values of $m$. For the models based on $\phi_{1,2}$, the situation is rather different. In this case, only one perturbative expansion is known but it is well behaved at large $m$. We confirm this with a computation of infinitely many anomalous dimensions at two loops. Their large-$m$ limits are obtained from both numerical extrapolations and a method we develop which carries out conformal perturbation theory using Mellin amplitudes. For minimal models, these can be accessed from the Coulomb gas representations of the correlators. This method reveals analytic expressions for some integrals in conformal perturbation theory which were previously only known numerically.</description>

      <title>Closures of moment expansion of anisotropic active Brownian particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of anisotropic active Brownian particles (ABPs), and more precisely their intermediate scattering function (ISF). To this end, we develop a systematic closure scheme for the moment expansion of their Fokker-Planck equation. Starting from the coupled evolution of translational and orientational degrees of freedom, we derive equations for the density, polarization, and nematic tensor fields, which naturally generate an infinite hierarchy of higher-order moments. To obtain explicit solutions, we investigate truncation strategies and analyze closures at different orders. While the closure at lowest order yields Gaussian dynamics with an effective translational diffusion, closures at higher orders incorporate orientational correlations and reproduce non-Gaussian features in the ISF. By confronting these approximations with exact solutions based on spheroidal wave functions and with Brownian dynamics simulations, we identify their range of validity in terms of P\'eclet number, wavenumber, and observation timescales. An advantage of this method is its ability to yield approximate yet explicit expressions not only for the ISF but also for polarization and nematic fields, which are often neglected but relevant in scattering experiments and theoretical modeling. Beyond providing a practical guide to select the appropriate closure according to the spatiotemporal regime, our framework highlights the efficiency of moment-based approaches compared to exact yet implicit formulations. This strategy can be systematically extended to more complex situations, such as propulsion switching, confinement, or external fields, where functional bases for exact solutions are generally unavailable.</description>

Abstract: Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, can manifest intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior, typical of frustrated non-ergodic states with high-dimensional energy landscapes. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain observed KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating our model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying a fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.</description>

Abstract: We investigates the dynamics of an open quantum system comprising a two-level electronic system coupled to local boson mode and a bosonic bath. The system is described by four distinct states, including the ground and excited electronic states, each with its corresponding zero- and one-boson vibrational levels. The dissipative dynamics arising from interactions with an external environment are modeled using two distinct theoretical frameworks: the standard Lindblad master equation and a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian approach. We derive the full Liouvillian superoperator for both formalisms, revealing a crucial distinction: while the Lindblad equation accounts for both state decay and repopulation via quantum jumps, the non-Hermitian formalism only captures the decay, leading to non-conservation of the total system probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a theoretical framework known as {\it ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory} has been developed to study large-scale fluctuations and correlations in many-body systems exhibiting ballistic transport. In this paper, we review this theory in the context of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods. The initial configurations of the rods are sampled from a probability distribution characterised by slowly varying conserved density profiles across space. Beginning from a microscopic description, we first formulate the macroscopic fluctuation theory in terms of the phase-space density of quasiparticles. In the second part, we apply this framework to compute the two-point, two-time correlation functions of the conserved densities in the Euler scaling limit. We derive an explicit expression for the correlation function which not only reveals its inherent symmetries, but is also straightforward to evaluate numerically for a given initial state. Our results also recover known expressions for space-time correlations in equilibrium for the hard-rod gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present some considerations about the parallel implementations of the kinetic (Monte Carlo) version of the Ising model. In some cases the equilibrium distribution of the parallel version does not present the symmetry breaking phenomenon in the low-temperature phase, i.e., the stochastic trajectory originated by the Monte Carlo simulation can jump between the distributions corresponding to both kinds of magnetization, or the lattice can break into two disjoint sublattices, each of which goes into a different asymptotic distribution (phase). In this latter case, by introducing a small asynchronism (dilution), we can have a transition between the homogeneous and the checkerboard phases, with metastable transients.</description>

      <title>Active-Passive Brownian Particle in Two Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.14155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a two-dimensional model for active particles whose self-propulsion speed is not fixed, but varies in time, and whose motion is subject to both translational and rotational diffusion. In the conventional treatment of active Brownian motion, the self-propulsion speed is taken to be constant - an assumption convenient for analysis but poorly matched to many real systems. Here we relax that assumption, allowing the speed $v(t)$ to fluctuate stochastically between two values: $v=0$ (a passive state) and $v=s$ (an active state). Transitions between these states are taken to follow a random telegraph process. This ``active-passive Brownian particle'' inherits limiting behaviors from both the purely active and purely passive Brownian cases. Analytical expressions for the first two displacement moments, and for the resulting effective diffusion coefficient, make this dual character explicit. Moreover, by an appropriate identification of parameters, a run-and-tumble particle - such as a motile bacterium - can be mapped onto this model in such a way that their large-scale diffusivities coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose {the Triadic Perceptron Model (TPM)} that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we formulate the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to extract triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to climate.</description>

Abstract: Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to holography, a black hole is dual to a thermal state in a strongly coupled quantum system. One of the best-known examples of holography is the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Despite extensive work on holographic thermodynamics, heat engines for CFT thermal states have not been explored. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles. The efficiency of most heat engines can be derived from the CFT equation of state, which follows from scale invariance, and we compare them to the efficiencies for an ideal gas. However, the Stirling efficiency for a generic CFT is uniquely determined in terms of its characteristic temperature and volume only in the high-temperature or large-volume regime. We derive an exact expression for the Stirling efficiency for CFT states dual to AdS-Schwarzschild black holes and compare the subleading corrections in the high-temperature regime with those in a generic CFT.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20457v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In statistical physics, the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism is used to derive an integro-differential equation for observables in a Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. However, the well-posedness of the abstract Cauchy problem for the orthogonal dynamics remains an open problem. Moreover, it is rarely discussed under which assumptions the Dyson identity, which is used to derive the GLE, holds. In this article, we address this issue for rank-one projections (Mori's projection). For the Mori projection, the orthogonal dynamics is obtained from the bounded perturbation theorem. The variation of constants formula for strongly continuous semigroups then yields the GLE and the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT). We show that the variation of constants can be replaced by a limiting process in order to give a general proof of the GLE and 2FDT that does not require the differentiability of the fluctuating forces. In addition, we offer an alternative approach that does not require the bounded perturbation theorem. Our starting point is the observation that the GLE and 2FDT uniquely determine the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. Furthermore, the orbit maps for the orthogonal dynamics can be directly defined via solutions of linear Volterra equations. All desired properties of the orthogonal dynamics are then proven directly from this definition. In particular, the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}\mathcal{Q}=\mathcal{QLQ}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup.</description>

      <title>How does the entanglement entropy of a many-body quantum system change after a single measurement?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For one-dimensional non-interacting complex fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after saturation, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurements protocols. In the thermodynamic limit, the system is in the area-law phase for any monitoring strength, however we can also study the distribution in the critical phase characterized by a logarithmic scaling of the EE with system size by considering a sufficiently weak monitoring strength. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero, likely a precursor of Zeno effect, that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength. Intriguingly, the distribution is spatially inhomogeneous. For sites around the boundary separating the subsystems defining the EE, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. As the monitoring strength increases, the full distribution is controlled by the boundary sites. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, where the change in EE is defined between two consecutive time steps, the distribution, Gaussian for weak monitoring, gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. For strong monitoring, the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect.</description>

      <title>Beyond Entanglement: Diagnosing quantum mediator dynamics in gravitationally mediated experiments</title>

Abstract: No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion near a soft surface</title>

Abstract: Brownian motion near soft surfaces is a situation widely encountered in nanoscale and biological physics. However, a complete theoretical description is lacking to date. Here, we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a two-dimensional colloid in an arbitrary external potential and near a soft surface. The latter is minimally modelled by a Winkler's foundation, and we restrict the study to the colloidal motion in the direction perpendicular to the surface. We start from deterministic hydrodynamic considerations, by invoking the already-established leading-order soft-lubrication forces acting on the particle. Importantly, a negative softness-induced and position-dependent added mass is identified. We then incorporate thermal fluctuations in the description. In particular, an effective Hamiltonian formulation is introduced and a temperature-dependent generalized potential is constructed in order to ensure equilibrium properties for the colloidal position. From these considerations and the Fokker-Planck equation, we then derive the relevant Langevin equation, which self-consistently allows to recover the deterministic equation of motion at zero temperature. Interestingly, besides an expected multiplicative-noise feature, the noise correlator appears to be modified by the surface softness. Moreover, a softness-induced temperature-dependent spurious drift term has to be incorporated within the Ito prescription. Finally, using numerical simulations with various initial conditions and parameter values, we statistically analyze the trajectories of the particle when placed within a harmonic trap and in presence of the soft surface. This allows us to: i) quantify further the influence of surface softness, through the added mass, which enhances the velocity fluctuations; and ii) show that intermediate-time diffusion is unaffected by softness, within the assumptions of the model.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the periodic Fredkin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fredkin chain is a spin-$1/2$ model with interaction of three nearest neighbors. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, the ground state is degenerate and can be described in terms of equivalence classes of Dyck paths. We introduce two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting on the ground states. These operators generate the $B$- or $C$-type Lie algebras, depending on whether the number of sites $N$ is odd or even, respectively, with rank $n=\lceil N/2\rceil$. The third component of the total spin operator can be represented as a sum of the Cartan subalgebra elements and some central element. In the $C$-type Lie algebra case (even number of sites), this representation coincides with a similar formula previously conjectured for spin-$1$ operators, in the context of the periodic Motzkin chain.</description>
