      <title>Majorana constellations for scalar beams and light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore Majorana stellar representation on the Riemann sphere for optical scalar beams and vector fields, leveraging the spin and orbital angular momentum of light. For scalar beams, the star constellations for the Laguerre-Gaussian beam basis reside at the poles of the sphere. For vector fields, these constellations represent well-defined circular polarization. The underlying $su(2)$ symmetry of angular momenta enables populating the sphere through generalized unitary rotations of the basis elements, resulting in optical analogues of Bloch and generalized $su(2)$ coherent states for both scalar beams and vector fields. Constellations for scalar Hermite-Gaussian beams and vector Hermite-Gaussian partial Poincar\'e fields, restricted to linear polarization, occupy the equator of the sphere as a result of these rotations. Additionally, we investigate scalar and vector analogues of cat codes and kings of quantumness, providing insights into the visualization and characterization of complex optical beams and fields with potential applications in optical communications.</description>

      <title>Modeling Atomistically Assembled Diffractive Optics in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model describing long-range atom-atom interactions in a two-dimensional periodic or aperiodic lattice of optical centers inside a solid-state host material. We consider realistic environmental and technical conditions such as frequency and position broadening. Even when considering a significant frequency broadening in the ensemble (approximately 300 GHz), we observe up to a three-fold increase in directional scattering from the resonant lattice in a system. The model can be used to scalably design quantum optical elements, e.g. a quantum lens, harnessing atomistic engineering (e.g. via ion implantation) of collective interactions in materials to enhance quantum properties.</description>

      <title>Observation of broadband super-absorption of electromagnetic waves through space-time symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using time as an additional design parameter in electromagnetism, photonics, and wave physics is attracting significant research interest, motivated by the possibility to explore physical phenomena and engineering opportunities beyond the physical limits of time-invariant systems. However, despite significant theoretical promise, the practical realization and observation of many new effects and capabilities leveraging such temporal degrees of freedom have remained elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of enhanced absorption of electromagnetic waves in a continuously modulated time-varying system, exceeding one of the key theoretical limits of linear time-invariant absorbers. This is achieved by harnessing the frequency-wavevector transitions and enhanced interference effects enabled by breaking both continuous space- and time-translation symmetries in a periodically time-modulated absorbing structure operating at radio-frequencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate broadband coherent wave absorption using a secondary control wave, observing a nearly perfect, reconfigurable, anti-reflection effect over a broad continuous bandwidth. Our findings provide new insights to challenge existing paradigms on the limits of wave absorption and may pave the way to the development of devices that operate in a regime fundamentally beyond the reach of any linear time-invariant system.</description>

      <title>In situ fully vectorial tomography and pupil function retrieval of tightly focused fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tightly focused optical fields are essential in nano-optics, but their applications have been limited by the challenges of accurate yet efficient characterization. In this article, we develop an in situ method for reconstructing the fully vectorial information of tightly focused fields in three-dimensional (3D) space, while simultaneously retrieving the pupil functions. Our approach encodes these fields using phase-modulated focusing and polarization-split detection, followed by decoding through an algorithm based on least-sampling matrix-based Fourier transform and analytically derived gradient. We further employ a focus scanning strategy. When combined with our decoding algorithm, this strategy mitigates the imperfections in the detection path. This approach requires only 10 frames of 2D measurements to realize approximate 90% accuracy in tomography and pupil function retrieval within 10s. Thus, it serves as a robust and convenient tool for the precise characterization and optimization of light at the nanoscale. We apply this technique to fully vectorial field manipulation, adaptive-optics-assisted nanoscopy, and addressing mixed-state problems.</description>

      <title>Molecular saturation determines distinct plasmonic enhancement scenarios for two-photon absorption signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon absorption in molecules, of significance for high-resolution imaging applications, is typically characterised with low cross sections. To enhance the TPA signal, one effective approach exploits plasmonic enhancement. For this method to be efficient, it must meet several criteria, including broadband operational capability and a high fluorescence rate to ensure effective signal detection. In this context, we introduce a novel plus-shaped silver nanostructure designed to exploit the coupling of bright and dark plasmonic modes. This configuration considerably improves both the absorption and fluorescence of molecules across near-infrared and visible spectra. By fine-tuning the geometrical parameters of the nanostructure, we align the plasmonic resonances with the optical properties of specific TPA-active dyes, i.e., ATTO 700, Rhodamine 6G, and ATTO 610.
  The expected TPA signal enhancement is evaluated using classical estimations based on the assumption of independent enhancement of absorption and fluorescence. These results are then compared with outcomes obtained in a quantum-mechanical approach to evaluate the stationary photon emission rate. Our findings reveal the important role of molecular saturation determining the regimes where either absorption or fluorescence enhancement leads to an improved TPA signal intensity, considerably below the classical predictions.
  The proposed nanostructure design not only addresses these findings, but also might serve for their experimental verification, allowing for active polarization tuning of the plasmonic response targeting the absorption, fluorescence, or both. The insight into quantum-mechanical mechanisms of plasmonic signal enhancement provided in our work is a step forward in the more effective control of light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Optical Routing via High Efficiency Composite Acoustic Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acousto-optical modulation (AOM) is a powerful and widely used technique for rapidly controlling the frequency, phase, intensity, and direction of light. Based on Bragg diffraction, AOMs typically exhibit moderate diffraction efficiency, often less than 90\% even for collimated inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that this efficiency can be significantly improved using a composite (CP) setup comprising a pair of 4-F-linked AOMs, enabling 2-by-2 beamsplitting with fully tunable splitting amplitude and phase. The efficiency enhancement arises from two effects, termed "momentum echo" and "high-order rephasing," which can be simultaneously optimized by adjusting the relative distance between the two AOMs. This method is resource-efficient, does not require ultra-collimation, and maintains control bandwidth. Experimentally, we achieved a diffraction efficiency exceeding 99\% (excluding insertion loss) and a 35 dB single-mode suppression of the 0th-order beam, demonstrating a full-contrast optical router with a switching time of less than 100~nanoseconds. Theoretically, we formulate the dynamics of CP-AOM in terms of multi-mode quantum control and discuss extensions beyond the $N=2$ configuration presented in this work. The substantially enhanced performance of CP-AOMs, coupled with reduced acoustic amplitude requirements, may significantly advance our ability to accurately control light at high speeds with low-loss acousto-optics.</description>

      <title>Fast thermo-optic switching on silicon nitride platform through parity-time symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a fast thermo-optic switching mechanism on silicon nitride on insulator platform leveraging parity-time symmetry breaking. The cladding-free design enables low-loss optical propagation in a partially metal-covered waveguide, with the same metal layer serving as an integrated heater for rapid phase tuning. The fabricated device exhibits an 8.5 {\mu}s rise time for a {\pi} phase shift, despite the weak thermo-optic coefficient in silicon nitride. Additionally, the impact of thermal cross-talk is investigated and an insertion loss as low as 0.39 dB for a 100-{\mu}m-long heater-waveguide section is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Theory of High-Temperature Superfluorescence in Hybrid Perovskite Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films has opened new possibilities for harnessing macroscopic quantum phenomena in nanotechnology. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism that enables high-temperature superfluorescence in these systems. The proposed model describes a quasi-2D Wannier exciton in a thin film that interacts with phonons via the longitudinal optical phonon-exciton Frohlich interaction. We show that the superradiant properties of the coherent state in hybrid perovskites are stable against perturbations caused by the longitudinal optical phonon-exciton Frohlich interaction. Using the multiconfiguration Hartree approach, we derive semiclassical equations of motion for a single-exciton wavefunction, where the vibrational degrees of freedom interact with the Wannier exciton through a mean-field Hartree term. Superradiance is effectively described by a non-Hermitian term in the Hamiltonian. The analysis was then extended to multiple excited states using the semiclassical Hamiltonian as the basic model. We demonstrate that the ground state of the model exciton Hamiltonian with long-range interactions is a symmetric Dicke superradiant state, where the Frohlich interaction is nullified. The additional density matrix-based consideration draws an analogy between this system and stable systems, where the conservation laws determine the nullification of the constant (momentum-independent) decay rate part. In the exciton-phonon system, nullification is associated with the absence of a momentum-independent component in the Wannier exciton-phonon interaction coupling function.</description>

      <title>All-optical damping forces enhanced by metasurfaces for stable relativistic lightsail propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightsails are a promising spacecraft concept that can reach relativistic speeds via propulsion by laser light, allowing travel to nearby stars within a human lifetime. The success of a lightsail mission requires that any motion in the plane transverse to the propagation direction is bounded and damped for the entire acceleration phase. Here, we demonstrate that a previously unappreciated relativistic force, which generalizes the Poynting-Robertson effect, can passively damp this transverse motion. We show that this purely optical effect can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to plane mirror sails by judicious design of the scattering response. We thus demonstrate that exploiting relativistic effects may be a practical means to control the motion of lightsails.</description>

      <title>Molecular Entanglement Witness by Absorption Spectroscopy in Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Producing and maintaining molecular entanglement at room temperature and detecting multipartite entanglement features of macroscopic molecular systems remain key challenges for understanding inter-molecular quantum effects in chemistry. Here, we study the quantum Fisher information, a central concept in quantum metrology, as a multipartite entanglement witness. We generalize the entanglement witness functional related to quantum Fisher information regarding non-identical local response operators. We show that it is a good inter-molecular entanglement witness for ultrastrong light-matter coupling in cavity quantum electrodynamics, including near the superradiant phase transition. We further connect quantum Fisher information to the dipole correlator, which suggests that this entanglement could be detected by absorption spectroscopy. Our work proposes a general protocol to detect inter-molecular entanglement in chemical systems at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear electronic dispersion relation of graphene endows the atomically thin carbon layer with a large intrinsic optical nonlinearity, with regard to both parametric and photothermal processes. While plasmons in graphene nanostructures can further enhance nonlinear optical phenomena, boosting resonances to the technologically relevant mid- and near-infrared (IR) spectral regime necessitates patterning on $\sim10$ nm length scales, for which quantum finite-size effects play a crucial role. Here we show that thermoplasmons in narrow graphene nanoribbons can be activated at mid- and near-IR frequencies with moderate absorbed energy density, and furthermore can drive substantial third-harmonic generation and optical Kerr nonlinearities. Our findings suggest that photothermal excitation by ultrashort optical pulses offers a promising approach to enable nonlinear plasmonic phenomena in nanostructured graphene that avoids potentially invasive electrical gating schemes and excessive charge carrier doping levels.</description>

      <title>In-Lab High Resolution Mid-infrared Up-conversion Stellar Interferometer Based on Synthetic Long Base-Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting mid-infrared (MIR) radiation has significant astronomical applications, although limited by unsatisfactory MIR detectors. Here we reported on the realization of a MIR up-conversion interferometer based on synthetic long base-line (SLBL) in the laboratory. The experimental system consisted of an interferometer and subsequent up-conversion detection part of mid-infrared signal, which streamlined the structure and enhanced the reliability of the system. By using a tungsten filament lamp as an imitated star, we not only achieved the single target angle resolution of 1.10 times 10^(-4) rad, but also obtained the field angle resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-4) rad of double star targets. The angular resolution is in inverse proportion to the length of baseline. The maximum length of simulated baseline in the laboratory is about 3cm. In a Keck Interferometer (KI) liked program, the base line can reach up to 85m leading to a corresponding angular resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-9) rad (about 1.8mas). The study will offer potential benefits in extending the usage of mid-infrared light in astronomical exploration.</description>

      <title>Low-cost demonstration of the Zeeman effect: From qualitative observation to quantitative experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zeeman effect, a fundamental quantum phenomenon, demonstrates the interaction between magnetic fields and atomic systems. While precise spectroscopic measurements of this effect have advanced significantly, there remains a lack of simple, visually accessible demonstrations for educational purposes. Here, we present a low-cost experiment that allows for direct visual observation of the Zeeman effect. Our setup involves a flame containing sodium (from table salt) placed in front of a sodium vapor lamp. When a magnetic field is applied to the flame, the shadow cast by the flame noticeably lightens, providing a clear, naked-eye demonstration of the Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we conduct two quantitative experiments using this setup, examining the effects of varying magnetic field strength and sodium concentration. This innovative approach not only enriches the experimental demonstration for teaching atomic physics at undergraduate and high school levels but also provides an open platform for students to explore the Zeeman effect through hands-on experience.</description>

      <title>Transverse Recoil Imprinted on Free-Electron Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phenomena of free-electron X-ray radiation are treated almost exclusively with classical electrodynamics, despite the intrinsic interaction being that of quantum electrodynamics. The lack of quantumness arises from the vast disparity between the electron energy and the much smaller photon energy, resulting in a small cross-section that makes quantum effects negligible. Here we identify a fundamentally distinct phenomenon of electron radiation that bypasses this energy disparity, and thus displays extremely strong quantum features. This phenomenon arises when free-electron transverse scattering occurs during the radiation process, creating entanglement between each transversely recoiled electron and the photons it emitted. This phenomenon profoundly modifies the characteristics of free-electron radiation mediated by crystals, compared to conventional classical analysis and even previous quantum analysis. We also analyze conditions to detect this phenomenon using low-emittance electron beams and high-resolution X-ray spectrometers. These quantum radiation features could guide the development of compact coherent X-ray sources facilitated by nanophotonics and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Supercontinua from integrated gallium nitride waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supercontinua are broadband spectra that are essential to optical spectroscopy, sensing, imaging, and metrology. They are generated from ultrashort laser pulses through nonlinear frequency conversion in fibers, bulk media, and chip-integrated waveguides. For any generating platform, balancing the competing criteria of strong nonlinearity, transparency, and absence of multiphoton absorption is a key challenge. Here, we explore supercontinuum generation in integrated gallium nitride (GaN) waveguides, which combine a high Kerr-nonlinearity, mid-infrared transparency, and a large bandgap that prevents two- and three-photon absorption in the technologically important telecom C-band, where compact erbium-based pump lasers exist. Using this type of laser, we demonstrate tunable dispersive waves and gap-free spectra extending to almost 4 micron in wavelength, relevant to functional group chemical sensing. Additionally, leveraging the material's second-order nonlinearity, we implement on-chip f-2f interferometry to detect the pump laser's carrier-envelope offset frequency, which enables precision metrology. These results demonstrate the versatility of GaN-on-sapphire as a new platform for broadband nonlinear photonics.</description>

Abstract: The interconnection of lasers is pivotal across various research domains, from generating high-power lasers to studying out-of-equilibrium coupled systems. This paper explores our investigation into Hermitian coupling between lasers in an array, with the aim of achieving arbitrary coupling and creating artificial gauge fields that can break time-reversal symmetry. For that, we investigated Hermitian coupling within three laser array geometries: a square array of 100 lasers, a triangular array of 130 lasers, and a ring array of 8 lasers. In the square array, we implemented arbitrary laser coupling with a precision of $2\pi/120$ radians, enabling the attainment of any desired phase-locking state. In the triangular array, we controlled the chirality of the lasers with 99% purity. In the ring array, the introduction of an artificial gauge field revealed discrete quantized first-order transitions between distinct topological phase-locking states. This arbitrary coupling, with control over both the strength and phase, paves the way for exploring spin systems and configurations characterized by exotic, non-conventional coupling.</description>

      <title>Realisation of a Coherent and Efficient One-Dimensional Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum emitter interacting with photons in a single optical-mode constitutes a one-dimensional atom. A coherent and efficiently coupled one-dimensional atom provides a large nonlinearity, enabling photonic quantum gates. Achieving a high coupling efficiency ($\beta$-factor) and low dephasing is challenging. Here, we use a semiconductor quantum dot in an open microcavity as an implementation of a one-dimensional atom. With a weak laser input, we achieve an extinction of $99.2\%$ in transmission and a concomitant bunching in the photon statistics of $g^{(2)}(0) = 587$, showcasing the reflection of the single-photon component and the transmission of the multi-photon components of the coherent input. The tunable nature of the microcavity allows $\beta$ to be adjusted and gives control over the photon statistics -- from strong bunching to anti-bunching -- and the phase of the transmitted photons. We obtain excellent agreement between experiment and theory by going beyond the single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model. Our results pave the way towards the creation of exotic photonic states and two-photon phase gates.</description>

      <title>Adaptive resolution of fine scales in modes of microstructured optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An adaptive algorithm for computing eigenmodes and propagation constants of optical fibers is proposed. The algorithm is built using a dual-weighted residual error estimator. The residuals are based on the eigensystem for leaky hybrid modes obtained from Maxwell equations truncated to a finite domain after a transformation by a perfectly matched layer. The adaptive algorithm is then applied to compute practically interesting modes for multiple fiber microstructures. Emerging microstructured optical fibers are characterized by complex geometrical features in their transverse cross-section. Their leaky modes, useful for confining and propagating light in their cores, often exhibit fine scale features. The adaptive algorithm automatically captures these features without any expert input. The results also show that confinement losses of these modes are captured accurately on the adaptively found meshes.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the fundamental limit of quantum transduction via intraband entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Edge-based OPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical proximity correction (OPC) is crucial for pushing the boundaries of semiconductor manufacturing and enabling the continued scaling of integrated circuits. While pixel-based OPC, termed as inverse lithography technology (ILT), has gained research interest due to its flexibility and precision. Its complexity and intricate features can lead to challenges in mask writing, increased defects, and higher costs, hence hindering widespread industrial adoption. In this paper, we propose DiffOPC, a differentiable OPC framework that enjoys the virtue of both edge-based OPC and ILT. By employing a mask rule-aware gradient-based optimization approach, DiffOPC efficiently guides mask edge segment movement during mask optimization, minimizing wafer error by propagating true gradients from the cost function back to the mask edges. Our approach achieves lower edge placement error while reducing manufacturing cost by half compared to state-of-the-art OPC techniques, bridging the gap between the high accuracy of pixel-based OPC and the practicality required for industrial adoption, thus offering a promising solution for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.</description>
