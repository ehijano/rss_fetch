      <title>Continuous Algebra: Algebraic Semantics for Continuous Propositional Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous logic extends classical logic to systems with infinitely varying truth values, enabling the study of graded truth systems. This work introduces continuous algebra as the algebraic semantics for Continuous Propositional Logic (CPL), a generalization of \L ukasiewicz logic with added operators and axioms for continuity. Continuous algebras extend MV-algebras by incorporating a unary operator $\kappa$, corresponding to the unary connective $\frac{1}{2}$ in CPL. We establish structural results, including the subdirect representation theorem, and introduce $\ell u^*$-groups to connect continuous algebras with algebraic representations. Leveraging these results, we prove the weak completeness of CPL, providing a robust algebraic framework for its study.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Induced Subgraphs for Bounded Shrub-Depth and the Expressive Power of MSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph parameter shrub-depth is a dense analog of tree-depth. We characterize classes of bounded shrub-depth by forbidden induced subgraphs. The obstructions are well-controlled flips of large half-graphs and of disjoint unions of many long paths. Applying this characterization, we show that on every hereditary class of unbounded shrub-depth, MSO is more expressive than FO. This confirms a conjecture of [Gajarsk\'y and Hlin\v{e}n\'y; LMCS 2015] who proved that on classes of bounded shrub-depth FO and MSO have the same expressive power. Combined, the two results fully characterize the hereditary classes on which FO and MSO coincide, answering an open question by [Elberfeld, Grohe, and Tantau; LICS 2012].
  Our work is inspired by the notion of stability from model theory. A graph class C is MSO-stable, if no MSO-formula can define arbitrarily long linear orders in graphs from C. We show that a hereditary graph class is MSO-stable if and only if it has bounded shrub-depth. As a key ingredient, we prove that every hereditary class of unbounded shrub-depth FO-interprets the class of all paths. This improves upon a result of [Ossona de Mendez, Pilipczuk, and Siebertz; Eur. J. Comb. 2025] who showed the same statement for FO-transductions instead of FO-interpretations.</description>

      <title>Monotone $T$-convex $T$-differential fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a complete, model complete o-minimal theory extending the theory of real closed ordered fields and assume that $T$ is power bounded. Let $K$ be a model of $T$ equipped with a $T$-convex valuation ring $\mathcal{O}$ and a $T$-derivation $\partial$ such that $\partial$ is monotone, i.e., weakly contractive with respect to the valuation induced by $\mathcal{O}$. We show that the theory of monotone $T$-convex $T$-differential fields, i.e., the common theory of such $K$, has a model completion, which is complete and distal. Among the axioms of this model completion, we isolate an analogue of henselianity that we call $T^{\partial}$-henselianity. We establish an Ax--Kochen/Ershov theorem and further results for monotone $T$-convex $T$-differential fields that are $T^{\partial}$-henselian.</description>

      <title>Full Generalized Effective Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the concept of effective reducibility between statements of set theory with ordinal Turing machines (OTMs) explored in earlier work for $\Pi_{2}$-statements to statements of arbitrary quantifier complexity in prenex normal form and use this to compare various fundamental set-theoretical principles, including the power set axiom, the separation scheme, the collection scheme and the replacement scheme, with respect to effective reducibility. This notion of reducibility is both different from (i.e., strictly weaker than) classical truth and from the OTM-realizability of the corresponding implications. Along the way, we obtain a computational characterization of HOD as the class of sets that are OTM-computable relative to every effectivizer of $\Sigma_{2}$-separation.</description>

      <title>A Note on Power-OTMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the computational strength of Power-OTMs, i.e., ordinal Turing machines equipped with a power set operator, and study a notion of realizability based on these machines. When parameters are allowed, these machines are equivalent to the Set Register Machines defined by Robert Passmann in \cite{Passmann}, and most of the results on Power-OTMs with parameters are analogous to results obtained by Passmann. New are the results about the strength of power-OTMs without parameters.</description>

      <title>Boolean basis, formula size, and number of modal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is it possible to write significantly smaller formulae when using Boolean operators other than those of the De Morgan basis (and, or, not, and the constants)? For propositional logic, a negative answer was given by Pratt: formulae over one set of operators can always be translated into an equivalent formula over any other complete set of operators with only polynomial increase in size. Surprisingly, for modal logic the picture is different: we show that elimination of bi-implication is only possible at the cost of an exponential number of occurrences of the modal operator $\lozenge$ and therefore of an exponential increase in formula size, i.e., the De Morgan basis and its extension by bi-implication differ in succinctness. Moreover, we prove that any complete set of Boolean operators agrees in succinctness with the De Morgan basis or with its extension by bi-implication. More precisely, these results are shown for the modal logic $\mathrm{T}$ (and therefore for $\mathrm{K}$). We complement them showing that the modal logic $\mathrm{S5}$ behaves as propositional logic: the choice of Boolean operators has no significant impact on the size of formulae.</description>
