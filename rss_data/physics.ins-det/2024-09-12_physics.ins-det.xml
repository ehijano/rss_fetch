      <title>Development of ion-beam sputtered silicon nitride thin films for low-noise mirror coatings of gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian thermal noise of thin-film coatings is a fundamental limit for high-precision experiments based on optical resonators such as gravitational-wave interferometers. Here we present the results of a research activity aiming to develop lower-noise ion-beam sputtered silicon nitride thin films compliant with the very stringent requirements on optical loss of gravitational-wave interferometers.
  In order to test the hypothesis of a correlation between the synthesis conditions of the films and their elemental composition and optical and mechanical properties, we varied the voltage, current intensity and composition of the sputtering ion beam, and we performed a broad campaign of characterizations. While the refractive index was found to monotonically depend on the beam voltage and linearly vary with the N/Si ratio, the optical absorption appeared to be strongly sensitive to other factors, as yet unidentified. However, by systematically varying the deposition parameters, an optimal working point was found. Thus we show that the loss angle and extinction coefficient of our thin films can be as low as $(1.0 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-4}$ rad at $\sim$2.8 kHz and $(6.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-6}$ at 1064 nm, respectively, after thermal treatment at 900 $^{\circ}$C. Such loss angle value is the lowest ever measured on this class of thin films.
  We then used our silicon nitride thin films to design and produce a multi-material mirror coating showing a thermal noise amplitude of $(10.3 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-18}$ m Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 100 Hz, which is 25\% lower than in current mirror coatings of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo interferometers, and an optical absorption as low as $(1.9 \pm 0.2)$ parts per million at 1064 nm.</description>

      <title>A general method for calibration of active scanning thermal probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) is a scanning probe technique aimed at quantitative characterization of local thermal properties at the length scale down to tens of nanometers. With many probe designs and approaches to interpretation of probe responses, there is a need for a universal framework, which would allow probe calibration and comparison of probe performance. Here, we have developed a calibration framework based on an abstracted, formal, probe model for active SThM probes. The calibration can be accomplished through measurements with two or three calibration samples. Requirements to calibration samples are described with examples of structures of suitable samples identified in published literature. A link to a published experimental work indirectly verifying the proposed procedure is provided. The calibration does not require knowledge of internal probe properties and yields a small and universal set of parameters that can be used to quantify thermal resistance presented to the probe by samples as well as to characterize active-mode SThM probes of any type and at any measurement frequency. We have illustrated how the probe calibration parameters can be used to guide probe design. We have also analyzed when the calibration approach can be used directly to measure thermal conductivity of unknown samples.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Novel Indium Phosphide Pad Detectors with Focused X-ray Beams and Laboratory Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future tracking systems in High Energy Physics experiments will require large instrumented areas with low radiation length. Crystalline silicon sensors have been used in tracking systems for decades, but are difficult to manufacture and costly to produce for large areas. We are exploring alternative sensor materials that are amenable to fast fabrication techniques used for thin film devices. Indium Phosphide pad sensors were fabricated at Argonne National Lab using commercially available InP:Fe 2-inch mono-crystal substrates. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characterizations were performed to study the basic operating characteristics of a group of sensors. Micro-focused X-ray beams at Canadian Light Source and Diamond Light Source were used to study the response to ionizing radiation, and characterize the uniformity of the response for several devices. The results show a high degree of performance uniformity in our evaluations, both within a device and between the 48 tested devices. This motivates further studies into thin film devices for future tracking detectors.</description>

      <title>TCAD modeling of radiation-induced defects in 4H-SiC diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) has several advantageous properties compared to Silicon (Si) that make it an appealing detector material, such as a larger charge carrier saturation velocity, bandgap, and thermal conductivity. While the current understanding of material and model parameters suffices to simulate unirradiated 4H-SiC devices using technical computer-aided design (TCAD), configurations to accurately predict performance degradation after high levels of irradiation due to induced defects acting as traps and recombination centers do not exist. Despite increasing efforts to characterize the introduction and nature of such defects in 4H-SiC, published results are often contradictory. This work presents a bulk radiation damage model for TCAD simulations based on measurements on 50 $\mu m$ 4H-SiC pad diodes, neutron-irradiated at various fluxes ranging from $5\times 10^{14}$ $n_{eq}/cm^2$ to $1\times 10^{16}$ $n_{eq}/cm^2$. The model accurately predicts internal electric shifts, such as flattening of the detector capacitance, degradation in charge collection efficiency (CCE), and signal detection capabilities under forward bias conditions up to high bias. It further introduces the EH$_4$ defect cluster as major lifetime killer and reinforces the assumption of the EH$_{6,7}$ deep-level defect to be of donor type.</description>

      <title>Latest activities and results from T2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The T2K neutrino oscillation experiment has gone through a period of renewal over the last couple of years, with several upgrades designed to improve sensitivity to leptonic CP violation. The change that most affects future analyses is the ND280 upgrade, which will constrain interaction models in new ways. At the same time the analysis continues to be developed, both by combining with the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric measurements and with refinements to the T2K-only analysis. This proceedings describes the highlights of these analyses, and the status of the various T2K upgrades.</description>
