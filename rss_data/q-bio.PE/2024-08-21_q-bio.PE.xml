      <title>A reassessment of the "hard-steps" model for the evolution of intelligent life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the "hard-steps" model, the origin of humanity required "successful passage through a number of intermediate steps" (so-called "hard" or "critical" steps) that were intrinsically improbable with respect to the total time available for biological evolution on Earth. This model similarly predicts that technological life analogous to human life on Earth is "exceedingly rare" in the universe. Here, we critically reevaluate the core assumptions of the hard-steps model in light of recent advances in the Earth and life sciences. Specifically, we advance a potential alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary novelties (or singularities) required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth's surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps in human evolution (e.g., the origin of eukaryotic cells, multicellular animals), then the "delay" in the appearance of humans can be best explained through the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history, with humanity arising relatively quickly once the right conditions were established. In this co-evolutionary (or geobiological) scenario, humans did not evolve "early" or "late" with respect to the total lifespan of the biosphere, but "on time."</description>

      <title>A Wild Sheep Chase Through an Orchard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orchards are a biologically relevant class of phylogenetic networks as they can describe treelike evolutionary histories augmented with horizontal transfer events. Moreover, the class has attractive mathematical characterizations that can be exploited algorithmically. On the other hand, undirected orchard networks have hardly been studied yet. Here, we prove that deciding whether an undirected, binary phylogenetic network is an orchard -- or equivalently, whether it has an orientation that makes it a rooted orchard -- is NP-hard. For this, we introduce a new characterization of undirected orchards which could be useful for proving positive results.</description>

      <title>A Review of Lagrangian Formalism in Biology: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrangian formalism has attracted the attention of mathematicians and physicists for more than 250 years and has played significant roles in establishing modern theoretical physics. The history of the Lagrangian formalism in biology is much shorter, spanning only the last 50 years. In this paper, a broad review of the Lagrangian formalism in biology is presented in the context of both its historical and modern developments. Detailed descriptions of different methods to derive Lagrangians for five selected population dynamics models are given and the resulting Lagrangians are presented and discussed. The procedure to use the obtained Lagrangians to gain new biological insights into the evolution of the populations without solving the equations of motion is described and applied to the models. Finally, perspectives of the Lagrangian formalism in biology are discussed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic decoupling of population growth rate and cell size distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rate at which individual bacterial cells grow depends on the concentrations of cellular components such as ribosomes and proteins. These concentrations continuously fluctuate over time and are inherited from mother to daughter cells, leading to correlations between the growth rates of cells across generations. Division sizes of cells are also stochastic and correlated across generations due to a phenomenon known as cell size regulation. Fluctuations and correlations from both growth and division processes affect the population dynamics of an exponentially growing culture. Here, we provide analytic solutions for the population dynamics of cells with continuously fluctuating growth rates coupled with a generic model of cell-size regulation. We show that in balanced growth, the effects of growth and division processes decouple; the population growth rate only depends on the single-cell growth rate process, and the population cell size distribution only depends on the model of division and cell size regulation. The population growth rate is always higher than the average single-cell growth rate, and the difference increases with growth rate variability and its correlation time. This difference also sets the timescale for the population to reach its steady state. We provide analytical solutions for oscillations in population growth rate and traveling waves in size distribution during this approach to the steady state.</description>

      <title>International Vaccine Allocation: An Optimization Framework</title>

Abstract: As observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, high-income countries, such as the U.S., may exhibit vaccine nationalism during a pandemic: stockpiling doses of vaccine for their own citizens and being reluctant to distribute doses of the vaccine to lower-income countries. While many cite moral objections to vaccine nationalism, vaccine inequity during a pandemic could possibly worsen the global effects of the pandemic, including in the high-income countries themselves, through the evolution of new variants of the virus. This paper uses the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study to identify scenarios under which it might be in a high-income nation's own interest to donate vaccine doses to another country before its own population has been fully vaccinated. We develop an extended SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) epidemiological model embedded in an optimization framework and examine scenarios involving a single donor and multiple recipient (nondonor) geographic areas. We find that policies other than donor-first can delay the emergence of a more-contagious variant compared to donor-first, sometimes reducing donor-country deaths in addition to total deaths. Thus, vaccine distribution is not a zero-sum game between donor and nondonor countries: an optimization approach can achieve a dramatic reduction in total deaths with only a small increase in donor-country deaths. The iterative linear programming approximation approach we develop can help confirm those instances when a priority policy is optimal and, when not optimal, can identify superior policies. This optimization framework can be used to guide equitable vaccine distribution in future pandemics.</description>

      <title>Survival of the flattest in the quasispecies model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viruses present an amazing genetic variability. An ensemble of infecting viruses, also called a viral quasispecies, is a cloud of mutants centered around a specific genotype. The simplest model of evolution, whose equilibrium state is described by the quasispecies equation, is the Moran--Kingman model. For the sharp peak landscape, we perform several exact computations and we derive several exact formulas. We obtain also an exact formula for the quasispecies distribution, involving a series and the mean fitness. A very simple formula for the mean Hamming distance is derived, which is exact and which do not require a specific asymptotic expansion (like sending the length of the macromolecules to $\infty$ or the mutation probability to $0$). We try also to extend these formulas to a general fitness landscape. We obtain an equation involving the covariance of the fitness and the Hamming class number in the quasispecies distribution. With the help of these formulas, we discuss the phenomenon of the error threshold and the notion of quasispecies. We recover the limiting quasipecies distribution in the long chain regime. We go beyond the sharp peak landscape and we consider fitness landscapes having finitely many peaks and a plateau--type landscape. We finally prove rigorously within this framework the possible occurrence of the survival of the flattest, a phenomenon which has been previously discovered by Wilke, Wang, Ofria, Lenski and Adami and which has been investigated in several works.</description>

      <title>Impact of a block structure on the Lotka-Volterra model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model is a simple, robust, and versatile model used to describe large interacting systems such as food webs or microbiomes. The model consists of $n$ coupled differential equations linking the abundances of $n$ different species. We consider a large random interaction matrix with independent entries and a block variance profile. The $i$th diagonal block represents the intra-community interaction in community $i$, while the off-diagonal blocks represent the inter-community interactions. The variance remains constant within each block, but may vary across blocks.
  We investigate the important case of two communities of interacting species, study how interactions affect their respective equilibrium. We also describe equilibrium with feasibility (i.e., whether there exists an equilibrium with all species at non-zero abundances) and the existence of an attrition phenomenon (some species may vanish) within each community.
  Information about the general case of $b$ communities ($b&gt; 2$) is provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Tree balance in phylogenetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree shape statistics, particularly measures of tree (im)balance, play an important role in the analysis of the shape of phylogenetic trees. With applications ranging from testing evolutionary models to studying the impact of fertility inheritance and selection, or tumor development and language evolution, the assessment of measures of tree balance is important. Currently, a multitude of at least 30 (im)balance indices can be found in the literature, alongside numerous other tree shape statistics.
  This diversity prompts essential questions: How can we assist researchers to choose only a small number of indices to mitigate the challenges of multiple testing? Is there a preeminent balance index tailored to specific tasks?
  This research expands previous studies on the examination of index power, encompassing almost all established indices and a broader array of alternative models, such as a variety of trait-based models. Our investigation reveals distinct groups of balance indices better suited for different tree models, suggesting that decisions on balance index selection can be enhanced with prior knowledge. Furthermore, we present the \textsf{R} software package \textsf{poweRbal} which allows the inclusion of new indices and models, thus facilitating future research on the power of tree shape statistics.</description>

      <title>Preserving system activity while controlling epidemic spreading in adaptive temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human behaviour strongly influences the spread of infectious diseases: understanding the interplay between epidemic dynamics and adaptive behaviours is essential to improve response strategies to epidemics, with the goal of containing the epidemic while preserving a sufficient level of operativeness in the population. Through activity-driven temporal networks, we formulate a general framework which models a wide range of adaptive behaviours and mitigation strategies, observed in real populations. We analytically derive the conditions for a widespread diffusion of epidemics in the presence of arbitrary adaptive behaviours, highlighting the crucial role of correlations between agents behaviour in the infected and in the susceptible state. We focus on the effects of sick-leave, comparing the effectiveness of different strategies in reducing the impact of the epidemic and preserving the system operativeness. We show the critical relevance of heterogeneity in individual behavior: in homogeneous networks, all sick-leave strategies are equivalent and poorly effective, while in heterogeneous networks, strategies targeting the most vulnerable nodes are able to effectively mitigate the epidemic, also avoiding a deterioration in system activity and maintaining a low level of absenteeism. Interestingly, with targeted strategies both the minimum of population activity and the maximum of absenteeism anticipate the infection peak, which is effectively flattened and delayed, so that full operativeness is almost restored when the infection peak arrives. We also provide realistic estimates of the model parameters for influenza-like illness, thereby suggesting strategies for managing epidemics and absenteeism in realistic populations.</description>
