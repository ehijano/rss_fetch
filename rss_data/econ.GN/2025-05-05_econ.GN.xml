      <title>Mapping the Intersection of Research and Policy in Centers for Medicare National Coverage Decision Memos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence is a crucial component of federal policy, but the interactions between the various stakeholders involved in funding, producing, and using the results of scientific research, an important class of evidence, for federal policy are poorly understood. The national coverage determination process used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to make significant policies on healthcare coverage is an ideal candidate for studying the interactions between stakeholders producing and utilizing scientific research for policy. Memos produced during the national coverage determination process contain information that identifies the organizations funding and producing research articles cited by CMS policy staff. I use these data to map scientific articles and their funding sources to discrete federal policies with substantial economic and health impacts. My analysis highlights that information derived from policy documents can facilitate transparency among the stakeholders involved in funding, producing, and using evidence for federal policy.</description>

      <title>Simulating Tertiary Educational Decision Dynamics: An Agent-Based Model for the Netherlands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs agent-based modelling to explore the factors driving the high rate of tertiary education completion in the Netherlands. We examine the interplay of economic motivations, such as expected wages and financial constraints, alongside sociological and psychological influences, including peer effects, student disposition, personality, and geographic accessibility. Through simulations, we analyse the sustainability of these trends and evaluate the impact of educational policies, such as student grants and loans, on enrollment and borrowing behaviour among students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, further considering implications for the Dutch labour market.</description>

      <title>DebtStreamness: An Ecological Approach to Credit Flows in Inter-Firm Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how credit flows through inter-firm networks is critical for assessing financial stability and systemic risk. In this study, we introduce DebtStreamness, a novel metric inspired by trophic levels in ecological food webs, to quantify the position of firms within credit chains. By viewing credit as the ``primary energy source'' of the economy, we measure how far credit travels through inter-firm relationships before reaching its final borrowers. Applying this framework to Uruguay's inter-firm credit network, using survey data from the Central Bank, we find that credit chains are generally short, with a tiered structure in which some firms act as intermediaries, lending to others further along the chain. We also find that local network motifs such as loops can substantially increase a firm's DebtStreamness, even when its direct borrowing from banks remains the same. Comparing our results with standard economic classifications based on input-output linkages, we find that DebtStreamness captures distinct financial structures not visible through production data. We further validate our approach using two maximum-entropy network reconstruction methods, demonstrating the robustness of DebtStreamness in capturing systemic credit structures. These results suggest that DebtStreamness offers a complementary ecological perspective on systemic credit risk and highlights the role of hidden financial intermediation in firm networks.</description>

      <title>Location matters: Exploring the effects of regional geographical and political characteristics on hydrogen pipeline costs globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transporting hydrogen using pipelines is becoming increasingly relevant in the energy system, yet current cost estimates typically rely on simplistic approaches that overlook region-specific characteristics, leading to potential underestimations of costs. This paper examines hydrogen pipeline costs by incorporating regional geographical factors, such as land use, topography and existing infrastructure, together with political-economic factors represented through country-specific weighted average costs of capital. Using a GIS-based model, we demonstrate that the regional levelized cost of transportation can vary by up to a factor of three. Comparing our approach with conventional ones based on uniform detour factors in an existing European energy system analysis framework shows substantial deviations in trade flows and highlights the relevance of this work. We provide cost and route data for 4,900 potential global pipeline routes. Our findings yield valuable insights for further research and stakeholders when assessing the economic viability of hydrogen as a competitive energy carrier.</description>

      <title>Product-level value chains from firm data: mapping trophic levels into economic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct a product-level input-output network based on firm-level import-export data of Italian firms. We show that the network has a statistically significant, yet nuanced trophic structure, which is evident at the product level but is lost when the classification is coarse-grained. This detailed value chain allows us to characterize the trophic distance between inputs and outputs of single firms, and to derive a coherent picture at the sector level, finding that sectors such as weapons and vehicles are the ones with the largest increase in downstreamness between their inputs and their outputs. Our measure of downstreamness at the product level can be used to derive country-level indicators that characterize industrial strategies and capabilities and act as predictors of economic growth. With respect to the standard input/output analysis, we show that the fine-grained structure is qualitatively different from what can be observed using sector-level data. We finally prove that, even if we leverage exclusively data from Italian firms, the metrics that we derive are predictive at the country level and capture a significant description of the input-output relations of global value chains.</description>

      <title>Multi-level emission impacts of electrification and coal pathways in China's netzero transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decarbonizing China's energy system requires both greening the power supply and electrifying end-use sectors. However, concerns exist that electrification may increase emissions while coal power dominates. Using a global climate model, we explore electrification scenarios with varying coal phase-out timelines and assess their climate impact on China's sectors. A ten-year delay in coal phase-out could increase global peak temperature by about 0.02{\deg}C. However, on a sectoral level, there is no evidence of significant additional emissions from electrification, even with a slower coal phase-out. This challenges the sequential ``order of abatement'' view, showing electrification can start before the power sector is fully decarbonized. As long as power emission intensity drops below 150 gCO2/kWh by 2040, electrification can substantially reduce the carbon footprint of buildings, steel, and transport services, and along with energy efficiency measures, it can avoid approximately 0.035{\deg}C of additional global warming by 2060.</description>
