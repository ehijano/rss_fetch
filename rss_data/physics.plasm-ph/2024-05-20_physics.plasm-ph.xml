      <title>Development of a plasma simulation tool for accelerating cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma processing of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities has shown an improvement in accelerating gradient by reducing the radiation due to field emission and multipacting. Plasma processing is a common technique where the free oxygen produced by the plasma breaks down and removes hydrocarbons from surfaces. This increases the work function and reduces the secondary emission coefficient. The hydrocarbon fragments of H2, CO, CO2, and H2O are removed from the system with the process gas which is flowing through the system. Here, we present COMSOL for the first time to simulate the plasma processing of an SRF cavity. In this work, we use Jefferson Lab's C75 SRF cavities design as our case study. Using simulation, we predict the condition of plasma ignition inside the SRF cavity. The simulation provides information about the optimal rf coupling to the cavity, mode for plasma ignition, choice of gas concentration, power, and pressure.</description>

      <title>Energetic particles transport in constants of motion space due to collisions in tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatio-temporal evolution of the energetic particles in the transport time scale in tokamak plasmas is a key issue of the plasmas confinement, especially in burning plasmas. In order to include sources and sinks and collisional slowing down processes, a new solver, ATEP-3D was implemented to simulate the evolution of the EP distribution in the three-dimensional constants of motion (CoM) space. The Fokker-Planck collision operator represented in the CoM space is derived and numerically calculated. The collision coefficients are averaged over the unperturbed orbits to capture the fundamental properties of EPs. ATEP-3D is fully embedded in ITER IMAS framework and combined with the LIGKA/HAGIS codes. The finite volume method and the implicit Crank-Nicholson scheme are adopted due to their optimal numerical properties for transport time scale studies. ATEP-3D allows the analysis of the particle and power balance with the source and sink during the transport process to evaluate the EP confinement properties.</description>

      <title>Linear gyrokinetic simulation of kinetic infernal mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic infernal mode (KIM) is an electromagnetic instability driven by thermal ions in weak magnetic shear region with a frequency similar to the kinetic ballooning mode (KBM). Gyrokinetic simulations of KIM using Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC) found that the electromagnetic instability shows a smooth transition from KBM to KIM in both frequency and growth rate when magnetic shear varies from strong to weak, which suggests that KIM and KBM may belong to the same mode physically. The mode structure analysis reveals that the mode transition is induced by the change in distance between adjacent mode rational surfaces. The magnetic shear and driving source effects are investigated in detail. The simulation results show that KIM prefers to grow on the mode rational surface nearest to the minimum magnetic shear, i.e., where the shear stabilizing effect is weakest, instead of at the maximum of density gradient or temperature gradient. However, the magnitude of the growth rate is determined by magnetic shear and temperature gradient simultaneously. These findings suggest that KIM can be effectively regulated by modifying the strength and position of magnetic shear, as well as pressure gradients.</description>

      <title>The JET hybrid H-mode scenario from a pedestal turbulence perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent transport is a decisive factor in determining the pedestal structure of H-modes. Here, we present the first comprehensive characterization of gyrokinetic turbulent transport in a JET hybrid H-mode pedestal. Local, linear simulations are performed to identify instabilities and global, nonlinear electromagnetic simulations reveal the turbulent heat and particle flux structure of the pedestal. Our analysis focuses on the Deuterium reference discharge \#97781 performed in the scenario development for the Deuterium-Tritium campaign. We find the pedestal top transport to be dominated by ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes. In the pedestal center turbulent ion transport is suppressed and electron transport is driven by multi-faceted electron temperature gradient (ETG) modes, which extend down to ion-gyroradius scales. A strong impact of $E\times B$ shear on the absolute turbulence level is confirmed by the global, nonlinear simulations. Furthermore, impurities are shown to reduce the main ion transport. Dedicated density and ion temperature profile variations test the sensitivity of the results and do not find strong differences in the turbulent transport in more reactor-like conditions.</description>

      <title>Identifying L-H transition in HL-2A through deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the operation of tokamak devices, addressing the thermal load issues caused by Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) eruption is crucial. Ideally, mitigation and suppression measures for ELMs should be promptly initiated as soon as the first low-to-high confinement (L-H) transition occurs, which necessitates the real-time monitoring and accurate identification of the L-H transition process. Motivated by this, and by recent deep learning boom, we propose a deep learning-based L-H transition identification algorithm on HL-2A tokamak. In this work, we have constructed a neural network comprising layers of Residual Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Unlike previous work based on recognition for ELMs by slice, this method implements recognition on L-H transition process before the first ELMs crash. Therefore the mitigation techniques can be triggered in time to suppress the initial ELMs bursts. In order to further explain the effectiveness of the algorithm, we developed a series of evaluation indicators by shots, and the results show that this algorithm can provide necessary reference for the mitigation and suppression system.</description>

      <title>First principles simulations of dense hydrogen</title>

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the properties of hydrogen at high compression is crucial for astrophysics (e.g. planetary and stellar interiors, brown dwarfs, atmosphere of compact stars) and laboratory experiments, including inertial confinement fusion. There exists experimental data for the equation of state, conductivity, and Thomson scattering spectra. However, the analysis of the measurements at extreme pressures and temperatures typically involves additional model assumptions, which makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the experimental data. rigorously. On the other hand, theory and modeling have produced extensive collections of data. They originate from a very large variety of models and simulations including path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations, density functional theory (DFT), chemical models, machine-learned models, and combinations thereof. At the same time, each of these methods has fundamental limitations (fermion sign problem in PIMC, approximate exchange-correlation functionals of DFT, inconsistent interaction energy contributions in chemical models, etc.), so for some parameter ranges accurate predictions are difficult. Recently, a number of breakthroughs in first principle PIMC and DFT simulations were achieved which are discussed in this review. Here we use these results to benchmark different simulation methods. We present an update of the hydrogen phase diagram at high pressures, the expected phase transitions, and thermodynamic properties including the equation of state and momentum distribution. Furthermore, we discuss available dynamic results for warm dense hydrogen, including the conductivity, dynamic structure factor, plasmon dispersion, imaginary-time structure, and density response functions. We conclude by outlining strategies to combine different simulations to achieve accurate theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>From eruption to post-flare rain: a 2.5D MHD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of the MFRs in the pre-flare stage, and how this leads to coronal rain in a post-eruption magnetic loop is not fully understood. We explore the formation, and eruption of MFRs, followed by the appearance of coronal rain in the post-flare loops, to understand the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of eruptive events and their multi-thermal aspects in the solar atmosphere. We perform a resistive-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation with the open-source code \texttt{MPI-AMRVAC} to explore the evolution of sheared magnetic arcades that can lead to flux rope eruptions. The system is in mechanical imbalance at the initial state, and evolves self-consistently in a non-adiabatic atmosphere under the influence of radiative losses, thermal conduction, and background heating. We use an additional level of adaptive mesh refinement to achieve the smallest cell size of $\approx 32.7$ km in each direction to reveal the fine structures in the system. The system achieves a semi-equilibrium state after a short transient evolution from its initial mechanically imbalanced condition. A series of erupting MFRs is formed due to spontaneous magnetic reconnection, across current sheets created underneath the erupting flux ropes. Gradual development of thermal imbalance is noticed at a loop top in the post-eruption phase, which leads to catastrophic cooling and formation of condensations. We obtain plasma blobs which fall down along the magnetic loop in the form of coronal rain. The dynamical and thermodynamic properties of these cool-condensations are in good agreement with observations of post-flare coronal rain. The presented simulation supports the development and eruption of multiple MFRs, and the formation of coronal rain in post-flare loops, which is one of the key aspects to reveal the coronal heating mystery in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Three-dimensional Simulation of Surface Charging on Rotating Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface charging phenomenon of asteroids, mainly resulting from solar wind plasma and solar radiation, has been studied extensively. However, the influence of asteroid's rotation on surface charging has yet to be fully understood. Here neural network is established to replace numerical integration, improving the efficiency of dynamic three-dimensional simulation. We implement simulation of rotating asteroids and surrounding plasma environment under different conditions, including quiet solar wind and solar storms, various minerals on asteroid's surface also be considered. Results show that under typical solar wind, the maximum and minimum potential of asteroids will gradually decrease with their increasing periods, especially when solar wind is obliquely incident. For asteroid has period longer than one week, this decreasing trend will become extremely slow. During solar storm passing, solar wind plasma changes sharply, the susceptibility of asteroid's surface potential to rotation is greatly pronounced. Minerals on surface also count, plagioclase is the most sensitive mineral among those we explored, while ilmenite seems indifferent to changes in rotation periods. Understanding the surface charging of asteroid under various rotation periods or angles, is crucial for further research into solar wind plasma and asteroid's surface dust motion, providing a reference for safe landing exploration of asteroids.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Accurate Surrogates for Simulations of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly used to build computationally inexpensive surrogates for complex physical models. The predictive capability of these surrogates suffers when data are noisy, sparse, or time-dependent. As we are interested in finding a surrogate that provides valid predictions of any potential future model evaluations, we introduce an online learning method empowered by optimizer-driven sampling. The method has two advantages over current approaches. First, it ensures that all turning points on the model response surface are included in the training data. Second, after any new model evaluations, surrogates are tested and "retrained" (updated) if the "score" drops below a validity threshold. Tests on benchmark functions reveal that optimizer-directed sampling generally outperforms traditional sampling methods in terms of accuracy around local extrema, even when the scoring metric favors overall accuracy. We apply our method to simulations of nuclear matter to demonstrate that highly accurate surrogates for the nuclear equation of state can be reliably auto-generated from expensive calculations using a few model evaluations.</description>
