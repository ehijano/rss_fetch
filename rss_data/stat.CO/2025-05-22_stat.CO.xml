      <title>Restricted Spectral Gap Decomposition for Simulated Tempering Targeting Mixture Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulated tempering is a widely used strategy for sampling from multimodal distributions. In this paper, we consider simulated tempering combined with an arbitrary local Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and present a new decomposition theorem that provides a lower bound on the restricted spectral gap of the algorithm for sampling from mixture distributions. By working with the restricted spectral gap, the applicability of our results is extended to broader settings such as when the usual spectral gap is difficult to bound or becomes degenerate. We demonstrate the application of our theoretical results by analyzing simulated tempering combined with random walk Metropolis--Hastings for sampling from mixtures of Gaussian distributions. We show that in fixed-dimensional settings, the algorithm's complexity scales polynomially with the separation between modes and logarithmically with $1/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy in total variation distance.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Ensembling: Insights from Online Optimization and Empirical Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of Bayesian ensembles and address the challenge of learning optimal combinations of Bayesian models in an online, continual learning setting. To this end, we reinterpret existing approaches such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and Bayesian stacking through a novel empirical Bayes lens, shedding new light on the limitations and pathologies of BMA. Further motivated by insights from online optimization, we propose Online Bayesian Stacking (OBS), a method that optimizes the log-score over predictive distributions to adaptively combine Bayesian models. A key contribution of our work is establishing a novel connection between OBS and portfolio selection, bridging Bayesian ensemble learning with a rich, well-studied theoretical framework that offers efficient algorithms and extensive regret analysis. We further clarify the relationship between OBS and online BMA, showing that they optimize related but distinct cost functions. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we identify scenarios where OBS outperforms online BMA and provide principled guidance on when practitioners should prefer one approach over the other.</description>

      <title>AutoStep: Locally adaptive involutive MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many common Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernels can be formulated using a deterministic involutive proposal with a step size parameter. Selecting an appropriate step size is often a challenging task in practice; and for complex multiscale targets, there may not be one choice of step size that works well globally. In this work, we address this problem with a novel class of involutive MCMC methods -- AutoStep MCMC -- that selects an appropriate step size at each iteration adapted to the local geometry of the target distribution. We prove that under mild conditions AutoStep MCMC is $\pi$-invariant, irreducible, and aperiodic, and obtain bounds on expected energy jump distance and cost per iteration. Empirical results examine the robustness and efficacy of our proposed step size selection procedure, and show that AutoStep MCMC is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of effective sample size per unit cost on a range of challenging target distributions.</description>

      <title>hmmTMB: hidden Markov models with flexible covariate effects in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely applied in studies where a discrete-valued process of interest is observed indirectly. They have for example been used to model behaviour from human and animal tracking data, disease status from medical data, and financial market volatility from stock prices. The model has two main sets of parameters: transition probabilities, which drive the latent state process, and observation parameters, which characterise the state-dependent distributions of observed variables. One particularly useful extension of HMMs is the inclusion of covariates on those parameters, to investigate the drivers of state transitions or to implement Markov-switching regression models. We present the new R package hmmTMB for HMM analyses, with flexible covariate models in both the hidden state and observation parameters. In particular, non-linear effects are implemented using penalised splines, including multiple univariate and multivariate splines, with automatic smoothness selection. The package allows for various random effect formulations (including random intercepts and slopes), to capture between-group heterogeneity. hmmTMB can be applied to multivariate observations, and it accommodates various types of response data, including continuous (bounded or not), discrete, and binary variables. Parameter constraints can be used to implement non-standard dependence structures, such as semi-Markov, higher-order Markov, and autoregressive models. Here, we summarise the relevant statistical methodology, we describe the structure of the package, and we present an example analysis of animal tracking data to showcase the workflow of the package.</description>

      <title>BlockingPy: approximate nearest neighbours for blocking of records for entity resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entity resolution (probabilistic record linkage, deduplication) is a key step in scientific analysis and data science pipelines involving multiple data sources. The objective of entity resolution is to link records without common unique identifiers that refer to the same entity (e.g., person, company). However, without identifiers, researchers need to specify which records to compare in order to calculate matching probability and reduce computational complexity. One solution is to deterministically block records based on some common variables, such as names, dates of birth or sex or use phonetic algorithms. However, this approach assumes that these variables are free of errors and completely observed, which is often not the case. To address this challenge, we have developed a Python package, BlockingPy, which uses blocking via modern approximate nearest neighbour search and graph algorithms to reduce the number of comparisons. In this paper, we present the design of the package, its functionalities and two case studies related to official statistics. The presented software will be useful for researchers interested in linking data from various sources.</description>
