      <title>Contemporary Reaction to Gibbs's Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J. Willard Gibbs published a book in 1902 on statistical mechanics that quickly received significant attention from his contemporaries because of the reputation that he had secured with his prior work on thermodynamics. People reading Gibbs's book were often familiar with Ludwig Boltzmann's work on the kinetic theory of gases. This article looks at the published response to Gibbs's book in the decade following its publication. What did these readers get from reading Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics? How did they put that to use? Was it fruitful? Samuel H. Burbury had been strongly critical of the assumptions on which Boltzmann's theory was built and had expressed a need for a theory without them. Burbury was pleased with the foundation and rigor of Gibbs's approach, since in his first three chapters he had built on analytical mechanics in the Hamiltonian formulation, a many-body dynamical system. Others found Gibbs hard to understand and some were critical. Hendrik A. Lorentz began teaching Gibbs's dynamical theory and supervised a thesis by Leonard Ornstein in which Orenstein developed applications built on grand canonical ensembles and correlations, which were contrary to Boltzmann's molecular disorder. Ornstein and Zernike expanded on material in that thesis to develop a theory of critical opalescence without infinities.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Locality from Electromagnetism to Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetism is the paradigm case of a theory that satisfies relativistic locality. This can be proven by demonstrating that, once the theory's laws are imposed, what is happening within a region fixes what will happen in the contracting light-cone with that region as its base. The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations meet the same standard. We show that this standard can also be applied to quantum field theory (without collapse), examining two different ways of assigning reduced density matrix states to regions of space. Our preferred method begins from field wave functionals and judges quantum field theory to be local. Another method begins from particle wave functions (states in Fock space) and leads to either non-locality or an inability to assign states to regions, depending on the choice of creation operators. We take this analysis of quantum field theory (without collapse) to show that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics is local at the fundamental level. We argue that this fundamental locality is compatible with either local or global accounts of the non-fundamental branching of worlds, countering an objection that has been raised to the Sebens-Carroll derivation of the Born Rule from self-locating uncertainty.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Idealization Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stephen Hawking's derivation of Hawking radiation relied on one particular spacetime model, that of a star collapsing into a black hole which then remains in existence forever. He then argued that Hawking radiation implies this model should be thrown away in favour of a different model, that of an evaporating black hole. This aspect of Hawking's argument is an example of an idealization that is pervasive in the literature on black hole thermodynamics, but which has not yet been widely discussed by philosophers. The aim of this paper is to clarify the nature of Hawking's idealization, and to show a sense in which it leads to a paradox. After identifying this idealization paradox in classic derivations of Hawking radiation, I go on to show how various research programmes in black hole thermodynamics can be viewed as possible resolutions to the paradox. I give an initial analysis of the prospects for success of these various resolutions, and show how they shed light on both the philosophical foundations of both Hawking radiation on the nature of idealizations in physics.</description>

      <title>A Revision for the Draconic Gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, the eclipse events of Saros spiral and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words completion of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.</description>
