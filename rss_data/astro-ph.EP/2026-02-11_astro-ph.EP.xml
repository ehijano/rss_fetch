      <title>Limits on the Post-eclipse Emission Spectrum of HD 80606 b From High-Resolution Spectroscop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Keck/NIRSPEC $K$-band observations of HD 80606 b, one of the most eccentric known exoplanets. HD 80606 b was observed after secondary eclipse, close to periastron, when the planet passes within 0.03 AU of HD 80606 and the rapid heating of the atmosphere may lead to extreme chemical changes and a temporary thermal inversion. The rapid change in the planetary radial velocity near periastron is sufficient to enable high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) analysis, which produces a tentative detection ($\rm SNR\sim4$) of HD 80606 b. Injection-recovery tests appear to reject strong thermal inversions near periastron, consistent with recent results from JWST. We also perform atmospheric retrievals with free parameters for the Pressure-Temperature ($P-T$) profile and with a profile matched to the JWST results, which suggest the presence of absorption features from CH$_4$ and CO. While HD 80606 b is not definitively detected in these data, these results are consistent with JWST observations, which found the post-eclipse atmosphere of HD 80606 b shows weak absorption features from these species. Future observations with higher spectral resolution and/or wider wavelength coverage are needed for a confident atmospheric detection of HD 80606 b via high-resolution spectroscopy alone, but such observations are a challenge to schedule due to the 111-day orbital period.</description>

      <title>Origin of Hyperion and Saturn's Rings in A Two-Stage Saturnian System Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The age of the rings and some of the moons of Saturn is an open question, and multiple lines of evidence point to a recent (few hundred Myr ago) cataclysm involving disruption of past moons. The main driver of the evolution of the Saturnian system is the relatively rapid tidal expansion of its largest moon, Titan, which is likely driven by resonant tides within Saturn. The obliquity of Saturn and the orbit of the small moon Hyperion both serve as a record of the past orbital evolution of Titan. Saturn's obliquity was likely generated by a secular spin-orbit resonance with the planets, while Hyperion is caught in a mean-motion resonance with Titan, with both phenomena driven by Titan's orbital expansion. We propose that the breaking of Saturn's spin resonance was also the event in which Hyperion formed, when an outer mid-sized satellite (``Proto-Hyperion'') was destabilized and collided with Titan, with some of the debris accreting into Hyperion. During the instability Proto-Hyperion's perturbations produced the observed orbital inclination of Iapetus. The same event also excited the eccentricity of Titan, which then, through Titan's resonant interaction with the inner moons, led to destabilization, collisional disruption and re-accretion of the inner moon system, including the rings. We present numerical integrations that show that this chain of events has a relatively high probability, and discuss how it fits within our knowledge of the Saturnian system.</description>

      <title>The compositions of the HR 8799 planets reflect accretion of both solids and metal-enriched gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With four giant planets ($m\sim5-10~M_{\rm Jup}$, $T_\rm{eff}\sim900-1200$ K) orbiting between 15-70 au, HR 8799 provides an unparalleled testbed for studying giant planet formation and probing compositional trends across the protoplanetary disk. We present new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations ($2.85-5.3~\mu$m, $R\approx2700$) that now include the spectrum of HR 8799 b, and higher S/N spectra for HR 8799 c, d, and e compared to that in Ruffio &amp; Xuan et al. 2026. We detect CO, CH$_4$, H$_2$O, H$_2$S, CO$_2$, and for planet b, NH$_3$. We combine the NIRSpec spectra with $1-5 \mu$m photometry to perform atmospheric retrievals that account for disequilibrium chemistry and clouds, and allow C/H, O/H, N/H, and S/H to scale independently. While the four planets are similarly enriched in carbon and oxygen, with C/H and O/H between $3-5\times$ stellar, we observe a tentative trend of increasing S/H - a tracer of refractory solids - from $2-5 \times$ stellar with increasing orbital distance. From HR 8799 b's NH$_3$ abundance, we estimate $\rm N/H=21.2^{+16.2}_{-8.8}\times$ stellar, suggesting the outer planet accreted significant amounts of N-rich gas. Overall, the elemental abundance patterns we observe are consistent with a picture where planet b formed between the CO snowline and the more-distant N$_2$ snowline, while the inner planets accreted $3 \times$ stellar CO-enriched disk gas within the CO snowline. The excess volatile mass from pebble drift and evaporation implies an integrated pebble flux of $750 \pm 200~M_{\oplus}$. The increase in the planets' S/H with orbital distance implies more solid accretion further out, which is quantitatively compatible with expectations from both pebble and planetesimal accretion ($2 \times$ Minimum Mass Solar Nebula) paradigms.</description>

      <title>A Narrowband Technosignature Search Toward the Hycean Candidate K2-18b Using the VLA and MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K2-18b, a sub-Neptune exoplanet located in the habitable zone of its host star, has emerged as an important target for atmospheric characterization and assessments of potential habitability. Motivated by recent interpretations of JWST observations suggesting a hydrogen-rich atmosphere consistent with Hycean-world scenarios, we conducted a coordinated, multi-epoch search for narrowband radio technosignatures using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array equipped with the COSMIC backend and the MeerKAT telescope with the BLUSE backend. Our observations span frequencies from 544MHz to 9.8GHz and include multiple epochs that cover at least one full orbital period of the planet. In this work, we outline, create, and apply a comprehensive post-processing framework that incorporates observatory-informed RFI masking, drift-rate filtering based on the expected dynamics of the K2-18 system, multibeam spatial discrimination, primary and secondary transit filtering (when applicable), and SNR-based excision of weak and strong spurious signals. Across all bands and epochs, no signals consistent with an astrophysical or artificial origin were identified at a limit of 10^12 to 10^13W. These non-detections allow us to place upper limits on the presence of persistent, isotropic narrowband transmitters within the K2-18 system, providing the first interferometric technosignature constraints for a Hycean-planet candidate. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of coordinated multiepoch interferometric searches and establish a methodological framework for future technosignature studies of nearby potentially habitable exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3's Dust Trail as a Source of Pickup Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is a short-period comet that has undergone multiple fragmentation events in the last few decades. During May-June 2006, while passing near Earth, multiple fragments of comet 73P passed sunward of Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1, while cometary pickup ions were detected concurrently by instruments on both the ACE and Wind spacecraft, implying the crossing of one or more ion tail. Additionally, during August 2011, a fragment of 73P passed directly sunward of spacecraft STEREO-B. A detection of cometary ions is shown to originate at fragment 73P-AM. Solar wind velocity measurements are used to extrapolate the flow of the solar wind in 3 dimensions and, when compared with the positions of known comets and cometary fragments, estimate the separation between the cometary ion tail and the spacecraft. Using this technique, it is shown that the alignment of the major cometary fragments with the spacecraft was poor for the transport of cometary ions via the solar wind, but the encounter was near enough for immersion in the diffuse ion tail surrounding an extended dust trail within which the nucleus fragments reside. This implies that, at this distance, the extended trail of cometary debris was a significant source of cometary ions in the case of comet 73P.</description>

      <title>NIAC project report: Solar system-scale VLBI to dramatically improve cosmological distance measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility and scientific potential of the Cosmic Positioning System (CPS), a space mission concept enabling purely geometric distance measurements to sources at hundreds of megaparsecs by directly detecting electromagnetic wavefront curvature. CPS consists of a constellation of radio antennas distributed across the outer Solar System, operating on baselines of tens of astronomical units. By precisely timing the arrival of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), CPS infers source distances via trilateration -- analogous to global navigation satellite systems such as GPS but on cosmological scales.
  We show that CPS distance measurements could result in sub-percent constraints on the Hubble constant with even a handful of detections, whereas we predict that 10-100 FRB sources are likely visible. We evaluate dominant sources of uncertainty -- wavefront timing precision, interstellar refractive delays, spacecraft positional knowledge, and onboard clock stability -- finding these controllable at required levels using near-term technologies. Our nominal design employs five spacecraft with 8 m deployable antennas, 3-6 GHz receivers with sub-30 K system temperatures, and space-qualified atomic clocks similar to those on GPS satellites, supported by a ground network for ranging calibration and FRB alerts.
  Beyond cosmic expansion, CPS may enable frontier measurements in astrophysics and fundamental physics, including constraints on small-scale dark matter structure, microhertz gravitational waves (bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA), and the outer Solar System mass distribution. The most significant viability issue concerns FRB properties at several-GHz frequencies; we recommend observational campaigns to characterize repeating FRBs in this band.</description>

      <title>The Y Dwarf Population with HST: unlocking the secrets of our coolest neighbours -- III. Near-Infrared Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Y dwarfs represent the coldest class of brown dwarfs, with effective temperatures below 500K, and provide unique analogues to cold giant exoplanets. We present a large compilation of uniform near-infrared photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope for 21 Y dwarfs across multiple WFC3/IR filters, including the F105W, F125W and F160W bands. We employed refined PSF-fitting and calibration procedures to reach photometric uncertainties at the 0.02-0.05 mag level for most targets. Combined with precise parallax measurements, our data reveal well-defined Y-dwarf sequences in near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams, observed with a markedly improved tightness. Known photometric trends emerge with minimal scatter, including the continuous redward progression in F125W-F160W with decreasing temperature, and the blueward trend in F105W-F125W with possible hints of a reversal around 350K. Comparisons to the ATMO, Sonora Elf Owl, and Lacy &amp; Burrows atmospheric models highlight systematic discrepancies, in particular F105W-F125W and F105W-F160W colours predicted to be too red. Low-metallicity grids provide the best fits to the global Y-dwarf population, although closer inspection across wavelengths shows that these preferences likely reflect compensating effects in missing or incomplete physics rather than true population-level abundances. While some atmospheric diversity is expected among Y dwarfs, their tight observational sequences and systematic offsets from model predictions reveal that key physical and chemical processes remain inadequately captured in current grids. Our results underscore the importance of high-precision, internally consistent datasets in robustly tracing the Y-dwarf cooling sequence and providing the empirical constraints needed to advance theoretical models at the lowest temperatures.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of starspot structure and differential rotation of Kepler-411</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09224v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starspots and their movements on stellar surfaces enable investigating the mechanisms of stellar magnetic activity. Information on the spot distribution and differential rotation provide important constraints for the behaviour of stellar magnetic dynamos. We analyse the Kepler photometry of Kepler-411, a known exoplanet host, to determine the distribution and properties of star spots on the stellar surface with two independent and complementary methods: modelling the photometric effect of rotation of spots on the stellar surface and mapping of spots by transiting planets. By constructing a spot model accounting for geometry, differential rotation and spot evolution, we model the spots of the stellar surface giving rise to the observed brightness variations. We also search for evidence for occultations of starspots in high-cadence photometry. Our spot models reproduce the observed photometric variations well and we are able to obtain information on the distribution and movement of spots on the stellar surface. We do not obtain evidence for differential rotation -- the rotational profile is consistent with rigid-body rotation with a period of 10.52$\pm$0.34 days. We detect three occultations of spots by planet c. The positions of these spots coincide well with the positions of larger spot structures identified by our modelling of the rotational modulation of the light curve.</description>

      <title>Operational Mass Measurement for Flyby Reconnaissance Missions of Potentially Hazardous Asteroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates a technique for determining the mass of a potentially hazardous asteroid from a high-speed flyby in the context of a rapid reconnaissance planetary defense scenario. We consider a host spacecraft that dispenses a small CubeSat, which acts as a test-mass. Both spacecraft perform approach maneuvers to target their flyby locations, with the host targeting a close proximity flyby and the CubeSat targeting a distant flyby. By incorporating short-range intersatellite measurements between the host and the CubeSat, the mass measurement sensitivity is substantially improved. We evaluate a set of proposed host and CubeSat hardware options against the 2023 and 2025 Planetary Defense Conference hypothetical threats, as well as a hypothetical flyby of 2024 YR4. These scenarios differ predominantly in their flyby speeds, which span from 1.7 to 22 km/s. Based on these scenarios, we demonstrate that a typical radio-frequency intersatellite measurement is ineffective for asteroids with diameters relevant to planetary defense (i.e., 50 - 500 m). However, we find that augmenting the system with a laser-based intersatellite ranging system or a high-precision Doppler system can enable mass measurements of asteroids as small as 100 m across all cases, and as small as 50 m for the slower (&lt; 8 km/s) cases. The results are very sensitive to the timing of the final maneuver, which is used to target the low-altitude flyby point. This presents an operational challenge for the smallest objects, where optical detection times are comparatively late and the optical navigation targeting knowledge converges too slowly.</description>

      <title>GEMS JWST: Transmission spectroscopy of TOI-5205b reveals significant stellar contamination and a metal-poor atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of transiting giant exoplanets around M dwarfs (GEMS) present an opportunity to investigate their atmospheric compositions and explore how such massive planets can form around low-mass stars contrary to canonical formation models. Here, we present the first transmission spectra of TOI-5205b, a short-period ($P=1.63~\mathrm{days}$) Jupiter-like planet ($M_p=1.08~\mathrm{M_J}$ and $R_p=0.94~\mathrm{R_J}$) orbiting an M4 dwarf. We obtained three transits using the PRISM mode of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spanning $0.6-5.3$ um. Our data reveal significant stellar contamination that is evident in the light curves as spot-crossing events and in the transmission spectra as a larger transit depth at bluer wavelengths. Atmospheric retrievals demonstrate that stellar contamination from unocculted star spots is the dominant component of the transmission spectrum at wavelengths $\lambda\lesssim3.0$ um, which reduced the sensitivity to the presence of clouds or hazes in our models. The degree of stellar contamination also prevented the definitive detection of any $\mathrm{H_2O}$, which has primary absorption features at these shorter wavelengths. The broad wavelength coverage of NIRSpec PRISM enabled a robust detection of $\mathrm{CH_4}$ and $\mathrm{H_2S}$, which have detectable molecular features between $3.0-5.0$ um. Our gridded and Bayesian retrievals consistently favored an atmosphere with both sub-solar metallicity ($\log\mathrm{[M/H]}\sim-2$ for a clear atmosphere) and super-solar C/O ratio ($\log\mathrm{[C/O]}\sim3$ for a clear or cloudy atmosphere). This contrasts with estimates from planetary interior models that predict a bulk metallicity of 10--20%, which is $\sim100\times$ the atmospheric metallicity, and suggests that the planetary interior for TOI-5205b is decoupled from its atmosphere and not well mixed.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Release of A databaSe of millimeTeR ObservatioNs of Asteroids Using acT (ASTRONAUT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present A databaSe of millimeTeR ObservatioNs of Asteroids Using acT (ASTRONAUT) hosted on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) in the form of a public Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. This bucket is an Amazon cloud storage database containing flux measurements for a group of asteroids at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. These measurements were collected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021 in frequency bands centered near 90, 150, and 220 GHz. The ASTRONAUT database contains observation times, normalized flux values, and associated error bars for 170 asteroids above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 for a single frequency band over the stacked co-added maps. We provide an example in generating light curves with this database. We also present a Jupyter notebook to serve as a reference guide when using the S3 bucket. The container and notebook are publicly available in a GitHub repository.</description>

Abstract: I present ExoIris, a user-friendly Python package for exoplanet transmission and emission spectroscopy. Unlike existing tools, ExoIris models two-dimensional spectrophotometric transit time series directly and supports the joint analysis of multiple datasets obtained with different instruments and at different epochs, as well as modeling stellar spot crossings and the influence of unocculted heterogeneities (the transit light source effect). These features enable a self-consistent estimation of both wavelength-independent and wavelength-dependent parameters. They offer a more robust workflow than the commonly used two-step approach, in which a "white" light curve is fitted first, and the transmission spectrum is then derived from independent fits constrained by the white-light solution. Despite its increased flexibility and robustness, ExoIris remains computationally efficient. A low-resolution transmission spectrum can be estimated from a single JWST NIRISS transit observation in ~5 minutes assuming white noise, and in ~15 minutes when accounting for time-correlated systematics using a Gaussian process noise model, on a standard desktop computer.</description>

      <title>NovaMoon: A Strategic Lunar Reference Station for Positioning, Timing, and Largely Enhanced Science in the Earth-Moon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity.</description>

      <title>RedDots: Multiplanet system around M dwarf GJ 887 in the solar neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GJ 887 is a bright M dwarf in the solar neighborhood with two currently reported nontransiting exoplanets with periods of $9~\mathrm{d}$ and $21~\mathrm{d,}$ along with an additional unconfirmed signal at $50~\mathrm{d}$. We reanalyzed the system with 101 new HARPS and 12 new ESPRESSO radial velocities (RVs) secured with a cadence to confirm or refute the origin of the $50~\mathrm{d}$ signal. To do so, we searched for signals related to stellar activity in photometric data and spectroscopic indicators. We modeled the stellar activity in the RVs with Gaussian processes (GPs). With the Bayesian analysis, we confirmed a four-planet model, including the two previously known planets at periods of $9.2619\pm0.0005~\mathrm{d}$ and $21.784\pm0.004~\mathrm{d,}$ as well as two newly confirmed exoplanets: an Earth-mass planet, with a $4.42490\pm0.00014~\mathrm{d}$ period and a sub-meter-per-second amplitude, and a super-Earth with a $50.77\pm0.05~\mathrm{d}$ period located in the habitable zone (HZ). This super-Earth is the second closest planet in the HZ, after Proxima Cen b. We found an additional signal in a 2:1 resonance with the $4.4~\mathrm{d}$ planet at $2.21661\pm0.00010~\mathrm{d}$ with an amplitude of $0.37\pm0.09~\mathrm{m/s}$, which could be related to an additional planet. However, other explanations of its origin are also plausible. This signal remains a candidate, as further investigation is required to confirm its true nature. If the signal is caused by a planet, its minimum mass would be half that of Earth. We measured the stellar rotation period with the characteristic periodic timescale of the GP. We found a period of $38.7\pm0.5~\mathrm{d}$, which is consistent with the rotation period determined from photometry and other activity indices.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength ALMA view of gas and dust in binary protoplanetary system AS 205: Evidence of dust asymmetric distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of multi-wavelength dust emissions at 3.1 and 1.3 mm; along with molecular line emissions of CO(2-1), CO(3-2), $^{13}$CO(3-2), and C$^{18}$O(3-2) at spatial resolutions of 7-45 AU towards the protoplanetary system AS 205. The dust emissions exhibit two distinct components of AS 205 N and AS 205 S, separated by 1.3 arcsec. While gas kinematics within the dust disk regions are dominated by Keplerian rotation, the more extended gas emission displays complex morphology and kinematics strongly affected by the binary gravitational interaction in the outer regions. The stellar masses of AS 205 N and AS 205 S are estimated at $0.78\pm0.19$ and $1.93\pm0.86$ M$_\odot$, respectively. Azimuthal variation is observed in the spectral index distribution of both disks. In AS 205 N, the spectral index minimum in the southwest is coincident with the peaks of CO($2-1$), CO($3-2$), and $^{13}$CO($3-2$) integrated intensity and the relative position of its southern counterpart. On the other hand, the spectral index distribution in AS 205 S exhibits two prominent maxima, with the one in the northeast aligning with the peak of $^{13}$CO($3-2$), and the peak in the south coinciding with local maxima in CO($2-1$) and CO($3-2$) azimuthal profiles. These results suggest a correlation between dust grain size and/or optical depth with the gas distributions. Dust trapping along the spiral arms possibly contributes to the spectral index minima in AS 205 N; however, the observed asymmetry across both disks suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms.</description>
