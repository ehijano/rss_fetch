      <title>Quantum Advantage for Multi-option Portfolio Pricing and Valuation Adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A critical problem in the financial world deals with the management of risk, from regulatory risk to portfolio risk. Many such problems involve the analysis of securities modelled by complex dynamics that cannot be captured analytically, and hence rely on numerical techniques that simulate the stochastic nature of the underlying variables. These techniques may be computationally difficult or demanding. Hence, improving these methods offers a variety of opportunities for quantum algorithms. In this work, we study the problem of Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) which has significant importance in the valuation of derivative portfolios. As a variant, we also consider the problem of pricing a portfolio of many different financial options. We propose quantum algorithms that accelerate statistical sampling processes to approximate the price of the multi-option portfolio and the CVA under different measures of dispersion. Technically, our algorithms are based on enhancing the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms by Montanaro with an unbiased version of quantum amplitude estimation. We analyse the conditions under which we may employ these techniques and demonstrate the application of QMC techniques on CVA approximation when particular bounds for the variance of CVA are known.</description>

      <title>Open-FinLLMs: Open Multimodal Large Language Models for Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial LLMs hold promise for advancing financial tasks and domain-specific applications. However, they are limited by scarce corpora, weak multimodal capabilities, and narrow evaluations, making them less suited for real-world application. To address this, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, the first open-source multimodal financial LLMs designed to handle diverse tasks across text, tabular, time-series, and chart data, excelling in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The suite includes FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a comprehensive 52-billion-token corpus; FinLLaMA-Instruct, fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions; and FinLLaVA, enhanced with 1.43M multimodal tuning pairs for strong cross-modal reasoning. We comprehensively evaluate Open-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new multimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms afvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP, decision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle real-world challenges. To foster innovation and collaboration across academia and industry, we release all codes (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIXIU2-0D70/B1D7/LICENSE) and models under OSI-approved licenses.</description>
