      <title>Flexible constraint satisfiability and a problem in semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.03127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine some flexible notions of constraint satisfaction, observing some relationships between model theoretic notions of universal Horn class membership and robust satisfiability. We show the \texttt{NP}-completeness of $2$-robust monotone 1-in-3 3SAT in order to give very small examples of finite algebras with \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. In particular we give a $3$-element algebra with this property, and solve a widely stated problem by showing that the $6$-element Brandt monoid has \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. These are the smallest possible sizes for a general algebra and a semigroup to exhibit \texttt{NP}-hardness for the membership problem of finite algebras in finitely generated varieties.</description>

      <title>Saccharinity with ccc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:1610.02706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using creature technology, we construct families of Suslin ccc non-sweet forcing notions $\mathbb Q$ such that $ZFC$ is equiconsistent with $ZF+$"every set of reals equals a Borel set modulo the $(\leq \aleph_1)$-closure of the null ideal associated with $\mathbb Q$"+"there is an $\omega_1$-sequence of distinct reals". This answers a question of the second author and Kellner. As an application of independent interest, we also show how our forcing adds a new $\Pi^1_2$ singleton over $L$ without relying on $L$-combinatorics.</description>

      <title>The prime spectrum of an $L$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the lattice of ideals of an arbitrary $L$-algebra is distributive. As a consequence, a spectral theory applies with no restriction. We also study the spectrum (i.e. the set of prime ideals) of $L$-algebras and characterize prime ideals in topological terms.</description>

      <title>Elementary first-order model checking for sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that for subgraph-closed graph classes the first-order model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if the class is nowhere dense [Grohe, Kreutzer, Siebertz, STOC 2014]. However, the dependency on the formula size is non-elementary, and in fact, this is unavoidable even for the class of all trees [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002]. On the other hand, it is known that the dependency is elementary for classes of bounded degree [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002] as well as for classes of bounded pathwidth [Lampis, ICALP 2023]. In this paper we generalise these results and almost completely characterise subgraph-closed graph classes for which the model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size. Those are the graph classes for which there exists a number $d$ such that for every $r$, some tree of depth $d$ and size bounded by an elementary function of $r$ is avoided as an $({\leq} r)$-subdivision in all graphs in the class. In particular, this implies that if the class in question excludes a fixed tree as a topological minor, then first-order model checking for graphs in the class is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size.</description>

      <title>Faithful Logic Embeddings in HOL -- Deep and Shallow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep and shallow embeddings of non-classical logics in classical higher-order logic have been explored, implemented, and used in various reasoning tools in recent years. This paper presents a method for the simultaneous deployment of deep and shallow embeddings of various degrees in classical higher-order logic. This enables flexible, interactive and automated theorem proving and counterexample finding at meta and object level, as well as automated faithfulness proofs between these logic embeddings. The method is beneficial for logic education, research and application and is illustrated here using a simple propositional modal logic. However, this approach is conceptual in nature and not limited to this simple logical context.</description>

      <title>Domains, Information Frames, Rough Sets: An Equivalence of Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalization of Scott's information systems~\cite{sco82} is presented that captures exactly all continuous domains. The global consistency predicate in Scott's definition is relativized. Now, for every atomic statement, there is a consistency predicate that states which finite sets of statements express information that is consistent with the given statement. The category of information frames is shown to be equivalent to the category of domains. Moreover, the relationship with CF-approximation spaces introduced by Wu and Xu~\cite{wx23} is studied. The corresponding category is also shown to be equivalent with the category of information frames. This research achieves a refinement of the equivalence result of Wu and Xu of the category of CF-approximation spaces with the category of domains.</description>

      <title>From learnable objects to learnable random objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between learnability of a "base class" of functions on a set $X$, and learnability of a class of statistical functions derived from the base class. For example, we refine results showing that learnability of a family $h_p: p \in Y$ of functions implies learnability of the family of functions $h_\mu=\lambda p: Y. E_\mu(h_p)$, where $E_\mu$ is the expectation with respect to $\mu$, and $\mu$ ranges over probability distributions on $X$. We will look at both Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, where example inputs and outputs are chosen at random, and online learning, where the examples are chosen adversarily. For agnostic learning, we establish improved bounds on the sample complexity of learning for statistical classes, stated in terms of combinatorial dimensions of the base class. We connect these problems to techniques introduced in model theory for "randomizing a structure". We also provide counterexamples for realizable learning, in both the PAC and online settings.</description>
