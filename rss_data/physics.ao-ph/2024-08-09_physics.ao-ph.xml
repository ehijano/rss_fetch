      <title>Quantifying intra-regime weather variability for energy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather regimes describe the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the mid-latitudes in terms of a few circulation states that modulate regional surface weather. Subseasonal forecasts of prevailing weather regimes have proven skillful and valuable to energy applications. Previous studies have mainly focused on the mean surface weather associated with a regime. However, we show in this paper that variability of surface weather within a regime cannot be ignored. These intra-regime variations, caused by different `subflavors' of the same regime, can be captured by continuous regime indices and allow a refined application of weather regimes. Here we discuss wintertime temperature and wind speed regime anomalies for four selected countries, and provide guidance on the operational use and interpretation of regime forecasts. In an accompanying supplementary dataset we provide similar analysis for all European countries, seasons and key energy variables, useful as an applied reference.</description>

      <title>Next-order balanced model captures submesoscale physics and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using nonlinear simulations in two settings, we demonstrate that QG$^\mathrm{+1}$, a potential-vorticity (PV) based next-order-in-Rossby balanced model, captures several aspects of ocean submesoscale physics. In forced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type background states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long cyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts. Despite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed scaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by $O(f)$ vorticity and convergence, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale flows. Simulations of QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced frontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a finite time blow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic equations. The inversions in the QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward elliptic problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the PV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. Together, these results suggest QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ as a useful tool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Fireball Luminous Efficiency Models using Acoustic Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The total energy of a fireball is commonly obtained from optical measurements with an assumed value for luminous efficiency. Acoustic energy measurements offer an independent means of energy estimation. Here we combine optical and acoustic methods to validate the luminous efficiency model of Borovi\v{c}ka et al. (2020). Our goal is to compare these models with acoustic measurements of meteoroid energy deposition. Employing theoretical blast scaling laws following the approach of McFadden et al. (2021), we determine explosive yields for both fireball fragmentation events and cylindrical shocks for four different bright fireballs. We model fireballs using the MetSim software (Vida et al., 2023) and find that the Borovi\v{c}ka et al. (2020) model produces agreement better than a factor of two for our three chondritic fireball case studies. The major exception is an iron meteorite-producing fireball where the luminous efficiency is an order of magnitude higher than model predictions calibrated with stony fireballs. We suggest that large disparities between optical and acoustic energies could be a signature of iron fireballs and hence useful as a discriminant of that population.</description>

      <title>In-situ data extraction for pathway analysis in an idealized atmosphere configuration of E3SM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach for characterizing source-impact pathways, the interactions of a set of variables in space-time due to an external forcing, in climate models using in-situ analyses that circumvent computationally expensive read/write operations. This approach makes use of a lightweight open-source software library we developed known as CLDERA-Tools. We describe how CLDERA-Tools is linked with the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) in a minimally invasive way for in-situ extraction of quantities of interested and associated statistics. Subsequently, these quantities are used to represent source-impact pathways with time-dependent directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The utility of CLDERA-Tools is demonstrated by using the data it extracts in-situ to compute a spatially resolved DAG from an idealized configuration of the atmosphere with a parameterized representation of a volcanic eruption known as HSW-V.</description>

      <title>Robust and accurate simulations of flows over orography using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically validate the static local mesh refinement capabilities of a recently proposed IMEX-DG scheme implemented in the framework of the deal.II library. Non-conforming meshes are employed in atmospheric flow simulations to increase the resolution around complex orography. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks with idealized as well as real orography profiles demonstrate that simulations with the refined mesh are stable for long lead times and no spurious effects arise at the interfaces of mesh regions with different resolutions. Moreover, correct values of the momentum flux are retrieved and the correct large-scale orographic response is established. Hence, large-scale orography-driven flow features can be simulated without loss of accuracy using a much lower total amount of degrees of freedom. In a context of spatial resolutions approaching the hectometric scale in numerical weather prediction models, these results support the use of locally refined, non-conforming meshes as a reliable and effective tool to greatly reduce the dependence of atmospheric models on orographic wave drag parametrizations.</description>
