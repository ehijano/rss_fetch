      <title>Maxwell Strata in the sub-Riemannian problem on solvable, nonnilpotent regular three-dimensional Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the sub-Riemannian problem associated with contact structures on connected, simply connected, solvable, non-nilpotent, regular three-dimensional Lie groups. For these groups, the vertical component of the Hamiltonian system takes the form of a perturbed pendulum. A qualitative phase-space analysis allows us to prove that this vertical component exhibits nontrivial symmetries. In particular, we are able to fully characterize the Maxwell set corresponding to these symmetries, and show that its first Maxwell time coincides with the period of the pendulum for almost all geodesics. This result yields an explicit upper bound for the cut time in terms of the period of the pendulum.</description>

      <title>A note on diffusive solutions of the Lyapunov and Riccati inequalities for quasi-monotone (QM) mappings on cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider three key properties of Metzler and nonnegative matrices and extensions of these to classes of self-dual proper convex cones. Specifically, we study mappings that are quasi-monotone (QM) with respect to a cone $K$ and discuss results extending D-stability, diagonal Lyapunov stability, and diagonal Riccati stability to this setting. Mappings that act diffusively with respect to the cone are used as generalisations of diagonal matrices. Relationships with recent results for symmetric cones obtained using Jordan algebraic methods are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Refinement in \v{C}ech Cohomology of Coron's Necessary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coron established a homological obstruction to continuous feedback stabilization of nonlinear control systems $\dot{x}=f(x,u)$ with $f \in C(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $f(0,0)=0$, showing that local asymptotic stabilizability implies the induced homomorphism $f_*$ satisfies $f_*\big(H_{n-1}(\Sigma_\epsilon)\big)=H_{n-1}(S^{n-1})$, where $\Sigma_\epsilon:=\Big(\big(\mathbb{B}_\epsilon^{\mathbb{R}^n}(0)\times\mathbb{B}_\epsilon^{\mathbb{R}^m}(0)\big)\cap \Omega\Big)\setminus f^{-1}(0)$. In this paper, we refine Coron's necessary condition using \v{C}ech cohomology and the Vietoris-Begle mapping theorem. Specifically, we prove that the closed version of $\Sigma_\epsilon$ must be a \v{C}ech cohomology $(n-1)$-sphere and that the restriction of $f$ to this subset induces an isomorphism on its \v{C}ech cohomology groups in all degrees. This strengthens Coron's condition from a constraint on the top class to a full cohomological rigidity statement.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems by Gain-Limited Feedback Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study local stabilization of nonlinear control systems under explicit gain constraints on the feedback law. Using a quantitative refinement of Brockett's openness condition, we introduce the notion of a maximal continuous openness rate for the system vector field near equilibrium. Combining this with a local-section characterization of stabilizability, we derive a general necessary condition for the existence of gain-limited stabilizing feedback. This condition yields sharp no-go results for broad classes of nonlinear systems, including systems that are stabilizable only by nonsmooth feedback. Several examples illustrate how openness rates impose fundamental lower bounds on stabilizing feedback growth near an equilibrium point.</description>

      <title>Improved Analysis of Restarted Accelerated Gradient and Augmented Lagrangian Methods via Inexact Proximal Point Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of double-loop (inner-outer) algorithms for convex composite optimization. For unconstrained problems, we develop a restarted accelerated composite gradient method that attains the optimal first-order complexity in both the convex and strongly convex settings. For linearly constrained problems, we introduce inexact augmented Lagrangian methods, including a basic method and an outer-accelerated variant, and establish near-optimal first-order complexity for both methods. The established complexity bounds follow from a unified analysis based on new inexact proximal point frameworks that accommodate relative and absolute inexactness, acceleration, and strongly convex objectives. Numerical experiments on LASSO and linearly constrained quadratic programs demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>The mean-field control problem for heterogeneous forward-backward systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of mean-field control when the state dynamics are given by general systems of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with heterogeneous mean-field interactions. Firstly, we introduce a novel methodology for reducing the well-posedness of such systems to that of a single randomized mean-field FBSDE. As a consequence, we show that, in the fully coupled case, smallness conditions yield existence and uniqueness for both the system itself and the associated variational and adjoint systems. Secondly, we derive a stochastic maximum principle and a verification for the mean-field control problem. This provides necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent path-planning in a moving medium via Wasserstein Hamiltonian Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite dimensional variational model for multi-agent path-planning in which a group of agents traverses from initial positions to a target distribution in a moving medium. The model is derived using the agent-based formulation of the Wasserstein Hamiltonian flows that transport between probability distributions while optimizing a running cost. The objective is the mismatch between their final positions and the target distribution. The constraints are a system of Hamiltonian equations that provide the trajectories of the agents. The free variables on which the optimization is defined form a finite vector of the initial velocities for the agents. The model is solved numerically by the L-BFGS method in conjunction with a shooting strategy. Several simulation examples, including a time-dependent moving medium, are presented to illustrate the performance of the model.</description>

      <title>Exploiting block triangular submatrices in KKT systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems that exploits block triangular submatrices by first using a Schur complement decomposition to isolate the block triangular submatrices then performing a block backsolve where only diagonal blocks of the block triangular form need to be factorized. We show that factorizing reducible symmetric-indefinite matrices with standard 1$\times$1 or 2$\times$2 pivots yields fill-in outside the diagonal blocks of the block triangular form, in contrast to our proposed method. While exploiting a block triangular submatrix has limited fill-in, unsymmetric matrix factorization methods do not reveal inertia, which is required by interior point methods for nonconvex optimization. We show that our target matrix has inertia that is known \textit{a priori}, letting us compute inertia of the KKT matrix by Sylvester's law. Finally, we demonstrate the computational advantage of this method on KKT systems from optimization problems with neural network surrogates in their constraints. Our method achieves up to 15$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art symmetric indefinite matrix factorization methods MA57 and MA86 in a constant-hardware comparison.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Algorithms in Average-Reward Multichain MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there is an extensive body of research analyzing policy gradient methods for discounted cumulative-reward MDPs, prior work on policy gradient methods for average-reward MDPs has been limited, with most existing results restricted to ergodic or unichain settings. In this work, we first establish a policy gradient theorem for average-reward multichain MDPs based on the invariance of the classification of recurrent and transient states. Building on this foundation, we develop refined analyses and obtain a collection of convergence and sample-complexity results that advance the understanding of this setting. In particular, we show that the proposed $\alpha$-clipped policy mirror ascent algorithm attains an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to positive policies.</description>

      <title>On the $q$-integrability of $p$-Wasserstein barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $L^q$-regularity of the density of barycenters of $N$ probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to the $p$-Wasserstein metric ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$). According to a previous result by the first author and collaborators, if one marginal is absolutely continuous, so is the $W_p$-barycenter. The next natural question is whether the $L^q$- regularity on the marginals is also preserved for any $q &gt; 1$, as in the classical case ($p=2$) of Agueh--Carlier, or for $W_p$-geodesics ($N=2$). Here we prove that this is the case if one marginal belongs to $L^q$ and the supports of all the marginals satisfy suitable geometric assumptions. However, we show that, as soon as $N&gt;2$, it is possible to find examples of $W_p$-barycenters which are not $q$-integrable, even if one marginal is compactly supported and bounded, thus highlighting the role played by the geometry of the supports. Furthermore, we provide a general estimate of the $L^q$-norm, including a detailed study of the sources of singularities, and a characterization of the $W_p$-barycenters \`a la Agueh--Carlier in terms of the associated Kantorovich potentials. Finally, we explicitly compute the $W_p$-barycenters of measures obtained as push-forward of special affine transformations. In this case, regularity holds without any additional requirement on the supports.</description>

      <title>Joint Parameter and State-Space Bayesian Optimization: Using Process Expertise to Accelerate Manufacturing Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box manufacturing processes, but its performance is often limited when dealing with high-dimensional multi-stage systems, where we can observe intermediate outputs. Standard BO models the process as a black box and ignores the intermediate observations and the underlying process structure. Partially Observable Gaussian Process Networks (POGPN) model the process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, using intermediate observations is challenging when the observations are high-dimensional state-space time series. Process-expert knowledge can be used to extract low-dimensional latent features from the high-dimensional state-space data. We propose POGPN-JPSS, a framework that combines POGPN with Joint Parameter and State-Space (JPSS) modeling to use intermediate extracted information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POGPN-JPSS on a challenging, high-dimensional simulation of a multi-stage bioethanol production process. Our results show that POGPN-JPSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the desired performance threshold twice as fast and with greater reliability. The fast optimization directly translates to substantial savings in time and resources. This highlights the importance of combining expert knowledge with structured probabilistic models for rapid process maturation.</description>

      <title>Variational optimization approach for reconstruction of dielectric permittivity and conductivity functions using partial boundary measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a variational optimization approach for the solution of a coefficient inverse problem of simultaneous reconstruction of the dielectric permittivity and conductivity functions in time-dependent Maxwell's system using limited boundary observations of the electric field.
  The variational optimization approach is based on constructing a weak form of a Lagrangian which allows to use finite element based reconstruction algorithms.
  The optimality conditions for the Lagrangian and stability estimate for the adjoint problem are derived, as well as Frech\'et differentiability of it and of the regularized Tikhonov functional are also presented. Two- and three-dimensional numerical studies confirm our theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Methods for Initial Orbit Determination and Orbit Determination in Cislunar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In orbital mechanics, Gauss's method for orbit determination (OD) is a popular, minimal assumption solution for obtaining the initial state estimate of a passing resident space object (RSO). Since much of the cislunar domain relies on three-body dynamics, a key assumption of Gauss's method is rendered incompatible, creating a need for a new, minimal assumption method for initial orbit determination (IOD). In this work, we present a framework for short and long term probabilistic target tracking in cislunar space which produces an initial state estimate with as few assumptions as possible. Specifically, we propose an IOD method involving the kinematic fitting of several series of noisy, consecutive ground-based observations. Once a probabilistic initial state estimate in the form of a particle cloud is formed, we apply the powerful Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) Filter to reduce the uncertainty of our state estimate over time. This combined IOD/OD framework is demonstrated for several classes of trajectories in cislunar space and compared to better-known filtering frameworks.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Online Resource Allocation: Learning from a Single Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online resource allocation under non-stationary demand with a minimum offline data requirement. In this problem, a decision-maker must allocate multiple types of resources to sequentially arriving queries over a finite horizon. Each query belongs to a finite set of types with fixed resource consumption and a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown, type-specific distribution. Critically, the environment exhibits arbitrary non-stationarity -- arrival distributions may shift unpredictably-while the algorithm requires only one historical sample per period to operate effectively. We distinguish two settings based on sample informativeness: (i) reward-observed samples containing both query type and reward realization, and (ii) the more challenging type-only samples revealing only query type information.
  We propose a novel type-dependent quantile-based meta-policy that decouples the problem into modular components: reward distribution estimation, optimization of target service probabilities via fluid relaxation, and real-time decisions through dynamic acceptance thresholds. For reward-observed samples, our static threshold policy achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For type-only samples, we first establish that sublinear regret is impossible without additional structure; under a mild minimum-arrival-probability assumption, we design both a partially adaptive policy attaining the same $\tilde{O}({T})$ bound and, more significantly, a fully adaptive resolving policy with careful rounding that achieves the first poly-logarithmic regret guarantee of $O((\log T)^3)$ for non-stationary multi-resource allocation. Our framework advances prior work by operating with minimal offline data (one sample per period), handling arbitrary non-stationarity without variation-budget assumptions, and supporting multiple resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Time consistent portfolio strategies for a general utility function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Merton portfolio management problem within a complete market, non constant time discount rate and general utility framework. The non constant discount rate introduces time inconsistency which can be solved by introducing sub game perfect strategies. Under some asymptotic assumptions on the utility function, we show that the subgame perfect strategy is the same as the optimal strategy, provided the discount rate is replaced by the utility weighted discount rate $\rho(t,x)$ that depends on the time $t$ and wealth level $x$. A fixed point iteration is used to find $\rho$. The consumption to wealth ratio and the investment to wealth ratio are given in feedback form as functions of the value function.</description>

      <title>Unifying Formal Explanations: A Complexity-Theoretic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work has explored the computational complexity of deriving two fundamental types of explanations for ML model predictions: (1) *sufficient reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when fixed, determine a prediction, and (2) *contrastive reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when modified, alter a prediction. Prior studies have examined these explanations in different contexts, such as non-probabilistic versus probabilistic frameworks and local versus global settings. In this study, we introduce a unified framework for analyzing these explanations, demonstrating that they can all be characterized through the minimization of a unified probabilistic value function. We then prove that the complexity of these computations is influenced by three key properties of the value function: (1) *monotonicity*, (2) *submodularity*, and (3) *supermodularity* - which are three fundamental properties in *combinatorial optimization*. Our findings uncover some counterintuitive results regarding the nature of these properties within the explanation settings examined. For instance, although the *local* value functions do not exhibit monotonicity or submodularity/supermodularity whatsoever, we demonstrate that the *global* value functions do possess these properties. This distinction enables us to prove a series of novel polynomial-time results for computing various explanations with provable guarantees in the global explainability setting, across a range of ML models that span the interpretability spectrum, such as neural networks, decision trees, and tree ensembles. In contrast, we show that even highly simplified versions of these explanations become NP-hard to compute in the corresponding local explainability setting.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Control of ADT Switched Linear Systems subject to Actuator Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid output-feedback control framework for average dwell-time (ADT) switched linear systems subject to actuator saturation. The considered subsystems may be exponentially unstable, and the saturation nonlinearity is explicitly handled through a deadzone-based representation. The proposed hybrid controller combines mode-dependent full-order dynamic output-feedback controllers with a supervisory reset mechanism that updates controller states at switching instants. By incorporating the reset rule directly into the synthesis conditions, switching boundary constraints and performance requirements are addressed in a unified convex formulation. Sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to guarantee exponential stability under ADT switching and a prescribed weighted ${\cal L}_2$-gain disturbance attenuation level for energy-bounded disturbances. An explicit controller construction algorithm is provided based on feasible LMI solutions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and computational tractability of the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over existing output-feedback saturation control methods.</description>

      <title>Incremental Input-to-State Stability and Equilibrium Tracking for Stochastic Contracting Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the contractivity of nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by deterministic inputs and Brownian motions. Given a weighted $\ell_2$-norm for the state space, we show that an SDE is incrementally noise- and input-to-state stable if its vector field is uniformly contracting in the state and uniformly Lipschitz in the input. This result is applied to error estimation for time-varying equilibrium tracking in the presence of noise affecting both the system dynamics and the input signals. We consider both Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes modeling unbounded noise and Jacobi diffusion processes modeling bounded noise. Finally, we turn our attention to the associated Fokker-Planck equation of an SDE. For this context, we prove incremental input-to-state stability with respect to an arbitrary $p$-Wasserstein metric when the drift vector field is uniformly contracting in the state and uniformly Lipschitz in the input with respect to an arbitrary norm.</description>

      <title>Convex Block-Cholesky Approach to Risk-Constrained Low-thrust Trajectory Design under Operational Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing robust trajectories under uncertainties is an emerging technology that may represent a key paradigm shift in space mission design. As we pursue more ambitious scientific goals (e.g., multi-moon tours, missions with extensive components of autonomy), it becomes more crucial that missions are designed with navigation (Nav) processes in mind. The effect of Nav processes is statistical by nature, as they consist of orbit determination (OD) and flight-path control (FPC). Thus, this mission design paradigm calls for techniques that appropriately quantify statistical effects of Nav, evaluate associated risks, and design missions that ensure sufficiently low risk while minimizing a statistical performance metric; a common metric is Delta-V99: worst-case (99%-quantile) Delta-V expenditure including statistical FPC efforts. In response to the need, this paper develops an algorithm for risk-constrained trajectory optimization under operational uncertainties due to initial state dispersion, navigation error, maneuver execution error, and imperfect dynamics modeling. We formulate it as a nonlinear stochastic optimal control problem and develop a computationally tractable algorithm that combines optimal covariance steering and sequential convex programming (SCP). Specifically, the proposed algorithm takes a block-Cholesky approach for convex formulation of optimal covariance steering, and leverages a recent SCP algorithm, SCvx*, for reliable numerical convergence. We apply the developed algorithm to risk-constrained, statistical trajectory optimization for exploration of dwarf planet Ceres with a Mars gravity assist, and demonstrate the robustness of the statistically-optimal trajectory and FPC policies via nonlinear Monte Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Polytopes of alternating sign matrices with dihedral-subgroup symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convex hulls of the eight dihedral symmetry classes of $n \times n$ alternating sign matrices, i.e., ASMs invariant under a subgroup of the symmetry group of the square. Extending the prefix-sum description of the ASM polytope, we develop a uniform core--assembly framework: each symmetry class is encoded by a set of core positions and an affine assembly map that reconstructs the full matrix from its core. This reduction transfers polyhedral questions to lower-dimensional core polytopes, which are better suited to the tool set of polyhedral combinatorics, while retaining complete information about the original symmetry class. For the vertical, vertical--horizontal, half-turn, diagonal, diagonal--antidiagonal, and total symmetry classes, we give explicit polynomial-size linear inequality descriptions of the associated polytopes. In these cases, we also determine the dimension and provide facet descriptions. The quarter-turn symmetry class behaves differently: the natural relaxation admits fractional vertices, and we need to extend the system with a structured family of parity-type Chv\'atal--Gomory inequalities to obtain the quarter-turn symmetric ASM polytope. Our framework leads to efficient algorithms for computing minimum-cost ASMs in each symmetry class and provides a direct link between the combinatorics of symmetric ASMs and tools from polyhedral combinatorics and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>PhiBE: A PDE-based Bellman Equation for Continuous Time Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study policy evaluation in continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL), where the state follows an unknown stochastic differential equation (SDE), but only discrete-time data are available. We first highlight that the discrete-time Bellman equation (BE) is not always a reliable approximation to the true value function because it ignores the underlying continuous-time structure. We then introduce a new Bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a continuous-time PDE formulation. By leveraging the smooth structure of the underlying dynamics, PhiBE provides a provably more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly or the reward oscillates. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations.
  We further develop a model-free algorithm for PhiBE under linear function approximation and establish its convergence under model misspecification, together with finite-sample guarantees. In contrast to existing continuous-time RL analyses, where the model misspecification error diverges as the sampling interval $\Delta t\to 0$ and the sample complexity typically scales as $O(\Delta t^{-4})$, our misspecification error is independent of $\Delta t$ and the resulting sample complexity improves to $O(\Delta t^{-1})$ by exploiting the smoothness of the underlying dynamics. Moreover, we identify a fundamental trade-off between discretization error and sample error that is intrinsic to continuous-time policy evaluation: finer time discretization reduces bias but amplifies variance, so excessively frequent sampling does not necessarily improve performance. This is an insight that does not arise in classical discrete-time RL analyses. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical guarantees we propose.</description>

      <title>Stochastic versus Deterministic in Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for a structured minimization problem involving a finite-sum function with its gradient being stochastically approximated, and an independent term with its gradient being deterministically computed. We focus on the stochastic versus deterministic behavior of the mini-batch SGD for this setting. A convergence analysis is provided that captures the different roles of these two parts. Linear convergence of the algorithm to a neighborhood of the minimizer is established under some smoothness and convexity assumptions. The step size, the convergence rate, and the radius of the convergence region depend asymmetrically on the characteristics of the two components, which shows the distinct impacts of stochastic approximation versus deterministic computation in the mini-batch SGD. Moreover, a better convergence rate can be obtained when the independent term endows the objective function with sufficient strong convexity. Also, the convergence rate of our algorithm in expectation approaches that of the classic gradient descent when the batch size increases. Numerical experiments are conducted to support the theoretical analysis as well.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a convex function over a closed convex set in a real Hilbert space. For linear functions, we show that a single orthogonal projection suffices to obtain an approximate solution. For continuous convex functions over convex sets, we show that projected subgradient ascent converges to a first-order stationary point when using arbitrarily large step sizes. Taking the step sizes to infinity leads to a deterministic variant of the conditional gradient algorithm, and iterated linear optimization as a special case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of linear control systems, a commonly-held intuition is that negative and positive feedback cannot both be stability enhancing. The canonical linear prototype is the scalar system $\dot x=u$ which, under negative linear feedback $u=-kx$ ($k &gt;0$) is exponentially stable for all $k &gt;0 $, whereas the lack of exponential instability of the (marginally stable) uncontrolled system is amplified by positive feedback $u=kx$ ($k &gt;0)$. By contrast, for nonlinear systems it is shown, by example, that this intuitive dichotomy may fail to hold.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Electricity Market Clearing Mechanisms via Reinforcement Learning: Prices, Remuneration and Competitive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pay-as-Clear (PaC) mechanism currently used in the European electricity market can generate significant submarginal profits for renewable sources when the clearing price is determined by the marginal offers of gas-fired generation units and the cost of natural gas exceeds certain levels. This exposes consumers to high price volatility related to the cost of natural gas. This report analyzes the recently proposed Segmented Pay-as-Clear (SPaC) mechanism as a market alternative, evaluating its system cost-effectiveness through simulations based on Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) to model the strategic behavior of operators. Three market models are compared, the two classic Pay-as-Clear (PaC) and Pay-as-Bid (PaB) along with SPaC, under two scenarios: a simplified one based on the 2030 NECP objectives and one built on the portfolios of ten operators obtained from the GME's 2024 public offers. The results show that the SPaC market clearing mechanism reduces intramarginal profits and price volatility compared to PaC, while maintaining fair participation incentives for all operators, and is more robust than PaB to the exercise of market power in oligopolistic contexts. The developed framework can serve as a support tool for regulators and policymakers in the evaluation of proposals for market design reforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish explicit convergence rates for the stochastic smooth approximations of infimal convolutions introduced and developed in \cite{MR4581306,MR4923371}. In particular, we quantify the convergence of the associated barycentric estimators toward proximal mappings and metric projections. We prove a dimension-explicit $\sqrt{\delta}$ bound, with explicit constants for the proximal mapping, in the $\rho$-weakly convex (possibly nonsmooth) setting, and we also obtain a dimension-explicit $\sqrt{\delta}$ rate for the metric projection onto an arbitrary convex set with nonempty interior. Under additional regularity, namely $C^{2}$ smoothness with globally Lipschitz Hessian, we derive an improved linear $O(\delta)$ rate with explicit constants, and we obtain refined projection estimates for convex sets with local $C^{2,1}$ boundary. Examples demonstrate that these rates are optimal.</description>

      <title>On the Necessity of Two-Stage Estimation for Learning Dynamical Systems under Both Noise and Node-Wise Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The least-squares estimator has achieved considerable success in learning linear dynamical systems from a single trajectory of length $T$. While it attains an optimal error of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ under independent zero-mean noise, it lacks robustness and is particularly susceptible to adversarial corruption. In this paper, we consider the identification of a networked system in which every node is subject to both noise and adversarial attacks. We assume that every node is independently corrupted with probability smaller than $0.5$ at each time, placing the overall system under almost-persistent local attack. We first show that no convex one-stage estimator can achieve a consistent estimate as $T$ grows under both noise and attacks. This motivates the development of a two-stage estimation method applied across nodes. In Stage I, we leverage the $\ell_1$-norm estimator and derive an estimation error bound proportional to the noise level $\sigma_w$. This bound is subsequently used to detect and filter out attacks, producing a clean dataset for each node, to which we apply the least-squares estimator in Stage II. The resulting estimation error is on the order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ plus the product of $\sigma_w$ and the number of misclassifications. In the event of perfect separability between attack and non-attack data, which occurs when injected attacks are sufficiently large relative to the noise scale, our two-stage estimator is consistent for the true system.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence of Stochastic Approximation: An Interplay of Noise and Step Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence of the Stochastic Approximation algorithm to the fixed point $x^\star$ of a nonlinear operator under a negative drift condition and a general noise sequence with finite $p$-th moment for some $p &gt; 1$. Classical almost sure convergence results of Stochastic Approximation are mostly analyzed for the square-integrable noise setting, and it is shown that any non-summable but square-summable step size sequence is sufficient to obtain almost sure convergence. However, such a limitation prevents wider algorithmic application. In particular, many applications in Machine Learning and Operations Research admit heavy-tailed noise with infinite variance, rendering such guarantees inapplicable. On the other hand, when a stronger condition on the noise is available, such guarantees on the step size would be too conservative, as practitioners would like to pick a larger step size for a more preferable convergence behavior. To this end, we show that any non-summable but $p$-th power summable step size sequence is sufficient to guarantee almost sure convergence, covering the gap in the literature.
  Our guarantees are obtained using a universal Lyapunov drift argument. For the regime $p \in (1, 2)$, we show that using the Lyapunov function $\norm{x-x^\star}^p$ and applying a Taylor-like bound suffice. For $p &gt; 2$, such an approach is no longer applicable, and therefore, we introduce a novel iterate projection technique to control the nonlinear terms produced by high-moment bounds and multiplicative noise. We believe our proof techniques and their implications could be of independent interest and pave the way for finite-time analysis of Stochastic Approximation under a general noise condition.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the transportation problem under a Monge cost structure and derive compact formulas for optimal dual solutions based on the northwest-corner rule. As an application illustrating how these formulas yield structural insight while enhancing computational performance, we consider a broad class of facility location problems. In particular, the expressions are used within a Benders decomposition framework to derive novel formulations for the Discrete Ordered Median Problem with non-increasing weights. Numerical experiments validate that the resulting formulations achieve state-of-the-art performance and exhibit strong robustness across a wide range of instances.</description>

      <title>Convergence of gradient descent for deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16462v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple local Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) criterion that guarantees linear (exponential) convergence of gradient flow and gradient descent to a zero-loss solution of a nonnegative objective. We then verify this criterion for the squared training loss of a feedforward neural network with smooth, strictly increasing activation functions, in a regime that is complementary to the usual over-parameterized analyses: the network width and depth are fixed, while the input data vectors are assumed to be linearly independent (in particular, the ambient input dimension is at least the number of data points). A notable feature of the verification is that it is constructive: it leads to a simple "positive" initialization (zero first-layer weights, strictly positive hidden-layer weights, and sufficiently large output-layer weights) under which gradient descent provably converges to an interpolating global minimizer of the training loss. We also discuss a probabilistic corollary for random initializations, clarify its dependence on the probability of the required initialization event, and provide numerical experiments showing that this theory-guided initialization can substantially accelerate optimization relative to standard random initializations at the same width.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Analyzing Meta-algorithms in Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08621v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the problem of online convex optimization in different settings, including different feedback types (full-information/semi-bandit/bandit/etc) in either stochastic or non-stochastic setting and different notions of regret (static adversarial regret/dynamic regret/adaptive regret). This is done through a framework which allows us to systematically propose and analyze meta-algorithms for the various settings described above. We show that any algorithm for online linear optimization with deterministic gradient feedback against fully adaptive adversaries is an algorithm for online convex optimization. We also show that any such algorithm that requires full-information feedback may be transformed to an algorithm with semi-bandit feedback with comparable regret bound. We further show that algorithms that are designed for fully adaptive adversaries using deterministic semi-bandit feedback can obtain similar bounds using only stochastic semi-bandit feedback when facing oblivious adversaries. We use this to describe general meta-algorithms to convert first order algorithms to zeroth order algorithms with comparable regret bounds. Our framework allows us to analyze online optimization in various settings, recovers several results in the literature with a simplified proof technique, and provides new results.</description>

      <title>Robust Output Tracking for Induced Seismicity Mitigation in Underground Reservoirs Governed by a Nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust output-feedback controller for induced seismicity mitigation in geological reservoirs described by a coupled 3D PDE-ODE model. The controller is a MIMO Super-Twisting design, producing a continuous control signal and requiring minimal model information, while accommodating parameter uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity. Two operational outputs are regulated simultaneously: regional pressures and seismicity rates computed over reservoir sub-regions. Closed-loop properties are established via explicit bounds on the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional dynamics and the nonlinear ODE system, yielding finite-time or exponential convergence of the tracking errors. The method is evaluated on a Groningen gas-field case study in two scenarios: gas production while not exceeding the intrinsic seismicity of the region, and combined production with CO$_2$ injection toward net-zero operation. Simulations demonstrate accurate tracking of pressure and seismicity targets across regions under significant parameter uncertainty, supporting safer reservoir operation without sacrificing production objectives.</description>

      <title>A uniform rate of convergence for the entropic potentials in the quadratic Euclidean setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We bound the rate of uniform convergence in compact sets for both entropic potentials and their gradients towards the Brenier potential and its gradient, respectively. Both results hold in the quadratic Euclidean setting for absolutely continuous measures satisfying some convexity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Sign-SGD via Parameter-Free Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved major advances across domains, yet training them remains extremely resource-intensive. We revisit Sign-SGD, which serves both as a memory-efficient optimizer for single-node training and as a gradient compression mechanism for distributed learning. This paper addresses a central limitation: the effective stepsize cannot be determined a priori because it relies on unknown, problem-specific quantities. We present a parameter-free Sign-SGD that removes manual stepsize selection. We analyze the deterministic single-node case, and extend the method to stochastic single-node training and multi-node settings. We also incorporate the momentum technique into our algorithms and propose a memory-efficient variant that stores only gradient signs instead of full gradients. We evaluate our methods on pre-training LLaMA models (130M and 350M) and fine-tuning a Swin Transformer (28M). Across considered tasks, the proposed methods match the performance of tuned Sign-SGD and AdamW (grid-searched stepsizes with a cosine schedule), while avoiding tuning overhead. Employing parameter-free training yields approximately $1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to runs with grid-searched stepsizes.</description>

      <title>New perturbation bounds for low rank approximation of matrices: Beyond Eckard-Young-Mirsky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with rank $r$ and spectral decomposition $A = \sum _{i=1}^r \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top, $ where $\sigma_i$ are its singular values, ordered decreasingly, and $u_i, v_i$ are the corresponding left and right singular vectors. For a parameter $1 \le p \le r$, $A_p := \sum_{i=1}^p \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading to the commonly used phrase "low-rank approximation". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. This error plays a critical role in estimating the accuracy of the output of any process involving a low-rank approximation of noisy input. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$, exploiting new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$. In many settings, we obtain notable quantitative improvements compared to classical approaches (using the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem or the Davis-Kahan theorem). This leads to a more accurate error estimate and better guarantee in the analysis of many algorithmic tasks.</description>

      <title>Adam Improves Muon: Adaptive Moment Estimation with Orthogonalized Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient stochastic optimization typically integrates an update direction that performs well in the deterministic regime with a mechanism adapting to stochastic perturbations. While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum, showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.</description>
