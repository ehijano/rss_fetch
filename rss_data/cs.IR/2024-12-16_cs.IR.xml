      <title>Combining knowledge graphs and LLMs for hazardous chemical information management and reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human health is increasingly threatened by exposure to hazardous substances, particularly persistent and toxic chemicals. The link between these substances, often encountered in complex mixtures, and various diseases are demonstrated in scientific studies. However, this information is scattered across several sources and hardly accessible by humans and machines. This paper evaluates current practices for publishing/accessing information on hazardous chemicals and proposes a novel platform designed to facilitate retrieval of critical chemical data in urgent situations. The platform aggregates information from multiple sources and organizes it into a structured knowledge graph. Users can access this information through a visual interface such as Neo4J Bloom and dashboards, or via natural language queries using a Chatbot. Our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in the time and effort required to access vital chemical information when datasets follow FAIR principles. Furthermore, we discuss the lessons learned from the development and implementation of this platform and provide recommendations for data owners and publishers to enhance data reuse and interoperability. This work aims to improve the accessibility and usability of chemical information by healthcare professionals, thereby supporting better health outcomes and informed decision-making in the face of patients exposed to chemical intoxication risks.</description>

      <title>Hesitation and Tolerance in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User interactions in recommender systems are inherently complex, often involving behaviors that go beyond simple acceptance or rejection. One particularly common behavior is hesitation, where users deliberate over recommended items, signaling uncertainty. Our large-scale surveys, with 6,644 and 3,864 responses respectively, confirm that hesitation is not only widespread but also has a profound impact on user experiences. When users spend additional time engaging with content they are ultimately uninterested in, this can lead to negative emotions, a phenomenon we term as tolerance. The surveys reveal that such tolerance behaviors often arise after hesitation and can erode trust, satisfaction, and long-term loyalty to the platform. For instance, a click might reflect a need for more information rather than genuine interest, and prolonged exposure to unsuitable content amplifies frustration. This misalignment between user intent and system interpretation introduces noise into recommendation training, resulting in suggestions that increase uncertainty and disengagement. To address these issues, we identified signals indicative of tolerance behavior and analyzed datasets from both e-commerce and short-video platforms. The analysis shows a strong correlation between increased tolerance behavior and decreased user activity. We integrated these insights into the training process of a recommender system for a major short-video platform. Results from four independent online A/B experiments demonstrated significant improvements in user retention, achieved with minimal additional computational costs. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing hesitation as a ubiquitous user behavior and addressing tolerance to enhance satisfaction, build trust, and sustain long-term engagement in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Static Pruning in Dense Retrieval using Matrix Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of dense retrieval, document indexing and retrieval is largely based on encoding models that transform text documents into embeddings. The efficiency of retrieval is directly proportional to the number of documents and the size of the embeddings. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to reduce embedding size without sacrificing - and in some cases improving - the retrieval effectiveness. However, the methods introduced by these studies are query-dependent, so they can't be applied offline and require additional computations during query processing, thus negatively impacting the retrieval efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel static pruning method for reducing the dimensionality of embeddings using Principal Components Analysis. This approach is query-independent and can be executed offline, leading to a significant boost in dense retrieval efficiency with a negligible impact on the system effectiveness. Our experiments show that our proposed method reduces the dimensionality of document representations by over 50% with up to a 5% reduction in NDCG@10, for different dense retrieval models.</description>

      <title>MST-R: Multi-Stage Tuning for Retrieval Systems and Metric Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulatory documents are rich in nuanced terminology and specialized semantics. FRAG systems: Frozen retrieval-augmented generators utilizing pre-trained (or, frozen) components face consequent challenges with both retriever and answering performance. We present a system that adapts the retriever performance to the target domain using a multi-stage tuning (MST) strategy. Our retrieval approach, called MST-R (a) first fine-tunes encoders used in vector stores using hard negative mining, (b) then uses a hybrid retriever, combining sparse and dense retrievers using reciprocal rank fusion, and then (c) adapts the cross-attention encoder by fine-tuning only the top-k retrieved results. We benchmark the system performance on the dataset released for the RIRAG challenge (as part of the RegNLP workshop at COLING 2025). We achieve significant performance gains obtaining a top rank on the RegNLP challenge leaderboard. We also show that a trivial answering approach games the RePASs metric outscoring all baselines and a pre-trained Llama model. Analyzing this anomaly, we present important takeaways for future research.</description>

      <title>Bridging AI and Science: Implications from a Large-Scale Literature Analysis of AI4Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has proven to be a transformative tool for advancing scientific research across a wide range of disciplines. However, a significant gap still exists between AI and scientific communities, limiting the full potential of AI methods in driving broad scientific discovery. Existing efforts in bridging this gap have often relied on qualitative examination of small samples of literature, offering a limited perspective on the broader AI4Science landscape. In this work, we present a large-scale analysis of the AI4Science literature, starting by using large language models to identify scientific problems and AI methods in publications from top science and AI venues. Leveraging this new dataset, we quantitatively highlight key disparities between AI methods and scientific problems in this integrated space, revealing substantial opportunities for deeper AI integration across scientific disciplines. Furthermore, we explore the potential and challenges of facilitating collaboration between AI and scientific communities through the lens of link prediction. Our findings and tools aim to promote more impactful interdisciplinary collaborations and accelerate scientific discovery through deeper and broader AI integration.</description>

      <title>Methods to Assess the UK Government's Current Role as a Data Provider for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compositions of generative AI training corpora remain closely-guarded secrets, causing an asymmetry of information between AI developers and organisational data owners whose digital assets may have been incorporated into the corpora without their knowledge. While this asymmetry is the subject of well-known ongoing lawsuits, it also inhibits the measurement of the impact of open data sources for AI training. To address this, we introduce and implement two methods to assess open data usage for the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) and 'peek behind the curtain' in order to observe the UK government's current contributions as a data provider for AI. The first method, an ablation study that utilises LLM 'unlearning', seeks to examine the importance of the information held on UK government websites for LLMs and their performance in citizen query tasks. The second method, an information leakage study, seeks to ascertain whether LLMs are aware of the information held in the datasets published on the UK government's open data initiative data.gov.uk. Our findings indicate that UK government websites are important data sources for AI (heterogenously across subject matters) while data.gov.uk is not. This paper serves as a technical report, explaining in-depth the designs, mechanics, and limitations of the above experiments. It is accompanied by a complementary non-technical report on the ODI website in which we summarise the experiments and key findings, interpret them, and build a set of actionable recommendations for the UK government to take forward as it seeks to design AI policy. While we focus on UK open government data, we believe that the methods introduced in this paper present a reproducible approach to tackle the opaqueness of AI training corpora and provide organisations a framework to evaluate and maximize their contributions to AI development.</description>

      <title>Logic Query of Thoughts: Guiding Large Language Models to Answer Complex Logic Queries with Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04264v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Future of Federated Recommendation Systems with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the integration of federated learning (FL) and recommendation systems (RS), known as Federated Recommendation Systems (FRS), has attracted attention for preserving user privacy by keeping private data on client devices. However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Models like ChatGPT are empowered by the concept of transfer learning and self-supervised learning, so they can be easily applied to the downstream tasks after fine-tuning or prompting. These models, so-called Foundation Models (FM), fouce on understanding the human's intent and perform following their designed roles in the specific tasks, which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and language domains. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of FRSs with FMs. Specifically, we: 1) summarise the common approaches of current FRSs and FMs; 2) review the challenges posed by FRSs and FMs; 3) discuss potential future research directions; and 4) introduce some common benchmarks and evaluation metrics in the FRS field. We hope that this position paper provides the necessary background and guidance to explore this interesting and emerging topic.</description>
