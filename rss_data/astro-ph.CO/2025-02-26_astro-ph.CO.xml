      <title>SHAM-OT: Rapid Subhalo Abundance Matching with Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) is widely used for connecting galaxies to dark matter haloes. In SHAM, galaxies and (sub-)haloes are sorted according to their mass (or mass proxy) and matched by their rank order. In this work, we show that SHAM is the solution of the optimal transport (OT) problem on empirical distributions (samples or catalogues) for any metric transport cost function. In the limit of large number of samples, it converges to the solution of the OT problem between continuous distributions. We propose SHAM-OT: a formulation of abundance matching where the halo-galaxy relation is obtained as the optimal transport plan between galaxy and halo mass functions. By working directly on these (discretized) functions, SHAM-OT eliminates the need for sampling or sorting and is solved using efficient OT algorithms at negligible compute and memory cost. Scatter in the galaxy-halo relation can be naturally incorporated through regularization of the transport plan. SHAM-OT can easily be generalized to multiple marginal distributions. We validate our method using analytical tests with varying cosmology and luminosity function parameters, and on simulated halo catalogues. The efficiency of SHAM-OT makes it particularly advantageous for Bayesian inference that requires marginalization over stellar mass or luminosity function uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with One Galaxy: Auto-Encoding the Galaxy Properties Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations like CAMELS and IllustrisTNG characterize hundreds of thousands of galaxies using various internal properties. Previous studies have demonstrated that machine learning can be used to infer the cosmological parameter $\Omega_m$ from the internal properties of even a single randomly selected simulated galaxy. This ability was hypothesized to originate from galaxies occupying a low-dimensional manifold within a higher-dimensional galaxy property space, which shifts with variations in $\Omega_m$. In this work, we investigate how galaxies occupy the high-dimensional galaxy property space, particularly the effect of $\Omega_m$ and other cosmological and astrophysical parameters on the putative manifold. We achieve this by using an autoencoder with an Information-Ordered Bottleneck (IOB), a neural layer with adaptive compression, to perform dimensionality reduction on individual galaxy properties from CAMELS simulations, which are run with various combinations of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We find that for an autoencoder trained on the fiducial set of parameters, the reconstruction error increases significantly when the test set deviates from fiducial values of $\Omega_m$ and $A_{\text{SN1}}$, indicating that these parameters shift galaxies off the fiducial manifold. In contrast, variations in other parameters such as $\sigma_8$ cause negligible error changes, suggesting galaxies shift along the manifold. These findings provide direct evidence that the ability to infer $\Omega_m$ from individual galaxies is tied to the way $\Omega_m$ shifts the manifold. Physically, this implies that parameters like $\sigma_8$ produce galaxy property changes resembling natural scatter, while parameters like $\Omega_m$ and $A_{\text{SN1}}$ create unsampled properties, extending beyond the natural scatter in the fiducial model.</description>

      <title>The DECADE cosmic shear project I: A new weak lensing shape catalog of 107 million galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. This catalog was assembled from public DECam data including survey and standard observing programs. These data were consistently processed with the Dark Energy Survey Data Management pipeline as part of the DECADE campaign and serve as the basis of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE) Early Data Release 3 (EDR3). We apply the Metacalibration measurement algorithm to generate and calibrate galaxy shapes. After cuts, the resulting cosmology-ready galaxy shape catalog covers a region of $5,\!412 \,\,{\rm deg}^2$ with an effective number density of $4.59\,\, {\rm arcmin}^{-2}$. The coadd images used to derive this data have a median limiting magnitude of $r = 23.6$, $i = 23.2$, and $z = 22.6$, estimated at ${\rm S/N} = 10$ in a 2 arcsecond aperture. We present a suite of detailed studies to characterize the catalog, measure any residual systematic biases, and verify that the catalog is suitable for cosmology analyses. In parallel, we build an image simulation pipeline to characterize the remaining multiplicative shear bias in this catalog, which we measure to be $m = (-2.454 \pm 0.124) \times10^{-2}$ for the full sample. Despite the significantly inhomogeneous nature of the data set, due to it being an amalgamation of various observing programs, we find the resulting catalog has sufficient quality to yield competitive cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>The DECADE cosmic shear project II: photometric redshift calibration of the source galaxy sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the photometric redshift characterization and calibration for the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. The redshifts are estimated from a combination of wide-field photometry, deep-field photometry with associated redshift estimates, and a transfer function between the wide field and deep field that is estimated using a source injection catalog. We construct four tomographic bins for the galaxy catalog, and estimate the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, within each one using the Self-organizing Map Photo-Z (SOMPZ) methodology. Our estimates include the contributions from sample variance, zeropoint calibration uncertainties, and redshift biases, as quantified for the deep-field dataset. The total uncertainties on the mean redshifts are $\sigma_{\langle z \rangle} \approx 0.01$. The SOMPZ estimates are then compared to those from the clustering redshift method, obtained by cross-correlating our source galaxies with galaxies in spectroscopic surveys, and are shown to be consistent with each other.</description>

      <title>The DECADE cosmic shear project III: validation of analysis pipeline using spatially inhomogeneous data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the pipeline for the cosmic shear analysis of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog consisting of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. The catalog derives from a large number of disparate observing programs and is therefore more inhomogeneous across the sky compared to existing lensing surveys. First, we use simulated data-vectors to show the sensitivity of our constraints to different analysis choices in our inference pipeline, including sensitivity to residual systematics. Next we use simulations to validate our covariance modeling for inhomogeneous datasets. Finally, we show that our choices in the end-to-end cosmic shear pipeline are robust against inhomogeneities in the survey, by extracting relative shifts in the cosmology constraints across different subsets of the footprint/catalog and showing they are all consistent within $1\sigma$ to $2\sigma$. This is done for forty-six subsets of the data and is carried out in a fully consistent manner: for each subset of the data, we re-derive the photometric redshift estimates, shear calibrations, survey transfer functions, the data vector, measurement covariance, and finally, the cosmological constraints. Our results show that existing analysis methods for weak lensing cosmology can be fairly resilient towards inhomogeneous datasets. This also motivates exploring a wider range of image data for pursuing such cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>The DECADE cosmic shear project IV: cosmological constraints from 107 million galaxies across 5,400 deg$^2$ of the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) cosmic shear analysis. This work uses shape measurements for 107 million galaxies measured through Dark Energy Camera (DECam) imaging of $5,\!412$ deg$^2$ of sky that is outside the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint. We derive constraints on the cosmological parameters $S_8 = 0.791^{+0.027}_{-0.032}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} =0.269^{+0.034}_{-0.050}$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model, which are consistent with those from other weak lensing surveys and from the cosmic microwave background. We combine our results with cosmic shear results from DES Y3 at the likelihood level, since the two datasets span independent areas on the sky. The combined measurements, which cover $\approx\! 10,\!000$ deg$^2$, prefer $S_8 = 0.791 \pm 0.023$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.277^{+0.034}_{-0.046}$ under the $\Lambda$CDM model. These results are the culmination of a series of rigorous studies that characterize and validate the DECADE dataset and the associated analysis methodologies (Anbajagane et. al 2025a,b,c). Overall, the DECADE project demonstrates that the cosmic shear analysis methods employed in Stage-III weak lensing surveys can provide robust cosmological constraints for fairly inhomogeneous datasets. This opens the possibility of using data that have been previously categorized as ``unusable'' for cosmic shear analyses, thereby increasing the statistical power of upcoming weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Dark sirens and the impact of redshift precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing number of gravitational wave detections, achieving a competitive measurement of $H_0$ with dark sirens is becoming increasingly feasible. The expansion of the Ligo-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration into a four detector network will reduce both the localisation area and the luminosity distance uncertainty associated with each gravitational wave event. It is therefore essential to identify and mitigate other major sources of error that could increase the uncertainty in $H_0$. In this work, we explore three scenarios relevant to the dark siren method in future observing runs. First, we demonstrate that there is a precision gain offered by a catalogue of spectroscopic-like redshifts compared to photometric-like redshifts, with the greatest improvements observed in smaller localisation areas. Second, we show that redshift outliers (as occur in realistic photometric redshift catalogues), do not introduce bias into the measurement of $H_0$. Finally, we find that uniformly sub-sampling spectroscopic-like redshift catalogues increases the uncertainty in $H_0$ as the completeness fraction is decreased; at a completeness of 50% the benefit of spectroscopic redshift precision is outweighed by the degradation from incompleteness. In all three scenarios, we obtain unbiased estimates of $H_0$. We conclude that a competitive measurement of $H_0$ using the dark siren method will require a hybrid catalogue of both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts, at least until highly complete spectroscopic catalogues become available.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on two vacuum decay models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain two vacuum decay models ($\Lambda(t)$CDM, proposed by the authors of~\cite{Brito:2024bhh}) utilizing the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance prior from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observed by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained via the cosmic chronometers (CC) method and type Ia supernova (SNIa) data. The interaction terms between dark matter and dark energy are defined as $Q=3\varepsilon H\rho_{\Lambda}$ for model I and $3\varepsilon aH\rho_{\Lambda}$ for model II. We find that the decay parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon=0.0094^{+0.0037}_{-0.0033}$ for model I and $\varepsilon=0.0119\pm{0.0045}$ for model II, respectively, indicating a potential interaction between dark matter and dark energy at the $2\sigma$ confidence level. The current Hubble parameter values are estimated to be $H_{0}=70.30\pm{0.67}$ for model I and $H_{0}=70.28\pm{0.64}$ for model II. These values of $H_0$ fall between those derived from the Planck and SH0ES data, suggesting that these two vacuum decay models could provide a potential solution to alleviate the Hubble tension problem.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution of the first stars can be determined via the 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the first stars and the subsequent population of X-ray binaries represents a fundamental transition in the state of the Universe as it evolves from near homogeneity to being abundant in collapsed structures such as galaxies. Due to a lack of direct observations, the properties of these stars remain highly uncertain. By considering the impact of the first stars and their remnant X-ray binaries on the cosmological 21-cm signal, we demonstrate that upcoming observations have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of these objects. We find a 25 mK sensitivity measurement of the 21-cm global signal by a wide-beam radiometer, such as REACH, or 3,000 hours of foreground avoidance observations of the 21-cm power spectrum by SKA-Low, could provide three-sigma constraints on the mass distribution of the first stars. Such measurements will fill a critical gap in our understanding of the early Universe and aid in interpreting high-redshift galaxy observations.</description>

      <title>Sparsity covariance: a source of uncertainty when estimating correlation functions with a discrete sample of observations in the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological observables rely heavily on summary statistics such as two-point correlation functions. In many practical cases (e.g. the weak-lensing cosmic shear), those correlation functions are estimated from a finite, discrete sample of measurements that are randomly distributed in the sky. The result then inevitably depends on the sample at hand, regardless of any experimental noise. This sample dependence is a source of uncertainty for cosmological observables which I call sparsity covariance. This article proposes a mathematical definition and a generic method to compute sparsity covariance. It is then applied to the concrete case of cosmic shear, showing that sparsity covariance mostly enhances shape noise, whose amplitude is determined by the apparent ellipticity of galaxies rather than their intrinsic ellipticity. In general, sparsity covariance is non-negligible when the signal-to-noise ratio of individual measurements in the sample is comparable to, or larger than, unity.</description>

      <title>Towards a Composite Framework for Simultaneous Exploration of New Physics in Background and Perturbed Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate deviations from $\Lambda$CDM by independently parameterizing modifications in the background evolution and the growth of structures. The background is characterized by two parameters, $A$ and $B$, which reduce to $\Omega_{m0}$ and $2/3$ in the $\Lambda$CDM limit, while deviations in the growth of structures are captured through a new fitting function for $f\sigma_8$ involving the growth index $\gamma$. Using recent observational datasets, we find significant evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM, with data suggesting a preference for modifications in the background evolution, likely due to evolving dark energy, rather than modifications to gravity. Additionally, our framework alleviates the $H_0$ tension and addresses the $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ tensions. We also demonstrate that future high-precision RSD data could unveil correlations between background and perturbation parameters that are currently suppressed by observational uncertainties, offering deeper insights into cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Spectral modelling of Cygnus A between 110 and 250 MHz. Impact on the LOFAR 21-cm signal power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the redshifted 21-cm signal from the the neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn is fundamental for understanding the physics of the early universe. One of the challenges that 21-cm experiments face is the contamination by bright foreground sources, such as Cygnus A, for which accurate spatial and spectral models are needed to minimise the residual contamination after their removal. In this work, we develop a new, high-resolution model of Cygnus A using Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations in the $110{-}250$ MHz range, improving upon previous models by incorporating physical spectral information through the forced-spectrum method during multi-frequency deconvolution. This approach addresses the limitations of earlier models by providing a more accurate representation of the complex structure and spectral behaviour of Cygnus A, including the spectral turnover in its brightest hotspots. The impact of this new model on the LOFAR 21-cm signal power spectrum is assessed by comparing it with both simulated and observed North Celestial Pole data sets. Significant improvements are observed in the cylindrical power spectrum along the Cygnus A direction, highlighting the importance of having spectrally accurate models of the brightest foreground sources. However, this improvement is washed out in the spherical power spectrum, where we measure differences of a few hundred mK at $k&lt;0.63\,h\,\text{cMpc}^{-1}$, but not statistically significant. The results suggest that other systematic effects must be mitigated before a substantial impact on 21-cm power spectrum can be achieved.</description>

      <title>$f(R)$ Gravity: Graviational Waves Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores modified theories of gravity, particularly $f(R)$ gravity, as extensions to General Relativity (GR) that offer alternatives to dark energy for explaining cosmic acceleration. These models generalize the Einstein-Hilbert action to include functions of the Ricci scalar, providing new insights into cosmology and astrophysics. The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has enabled rigorous tests of $f(R)$ gravity, as deviations in GW propagation, speed, and polarization can signal modifications to GR. Constraints on $f(R)$ models arise from LIGO-Virgo observations of binary mergers, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), and complementary tests in cosmology and weak-field regimes. Future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope, will enhance sensitivity to smaller deviations from GR, necessitating advancements in theoretical modeling. Among competing theories -- including scalar-tensor, massive gravity, and Horndeski models -- $f(R)$ gravity remains a pivotal framework for understanding fundamental gravitational physics and cosmology. This review highlights key developments, challenges, and future directions in the field.</description>

      <title>Listening for ultra-heavy dark matter with underwater acoustic detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-heavy dark matter is a class of candidates for which direct detection experiments are ineffective due to the suppressed dark matter flux. We explore the potential of large underwater acoustic arrays, developed for ultra-high energy neutrino detection, to detect ultra-heavy dark matter. As ultra-heavy dark matter traverses seawater, it deposits energy through nuclear scattering, generating thermo-acoustic waves detectable by hydrophones. We derive the dark matter-induced acoustic pressure wave from first principles and characterise attenuation effects, including frequency-dependent modifications due to viscous and chemical relaxation effects in seawater, providing an improved framework for signal modelling. Our sensitivity analysis for a hypothetical 100 cubic kilometre hydrophone array in the Mediterranean Sea shows that such an array could probe unexplored regions of parameter space for ultra-heavy dark matter, with sensitivity to both spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions. Our results establish acoustic detection as a promising dark matter search method, paving the way for analysing existing hydrophone data and guiding future detector designs.</description>

      <title>$f(Q)$ gravitational theory and its structure via red-shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for reconstructing the $f(Q)$ gravitational theory using parameterizations of the deceleration parameter or alternative options. This method enables the development of modified gravity scenarios that align with cosmological observations. We analyze two deceleration parameter models and one effective equation of state model from the literature. By leveraging the matter density parameter's asymptotic behaviour, we further refine the viable parameter space for these models. One tested model demonstrates that even slight modifications can yield viable cosmic scenarios, where the dark energy (DE) sector becomes dynamic and is entirely described instead of using a cosmological constant, we use modified gravity. These scenarios are qualitatively distinct yet quantitatively consistent with $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter Search using a 3.1 tonne $\times$ year Exposure of the XENONnT Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) via elastic DM-xenon-nucleus interactions in the XENONnT experiment. We combine datasets from the first and second science campaigns resulting in a total exposure of $3.1\;\text{tonne}\times\text{year}$. In a blind analysis of nuclear recoil events with energies above $3.8\,\mathrm{keV_{NR}}$, we find no significant excess above background. We set new upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section for WIMP masses above $10\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ with a minimum of $1.7\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ at $90\,\%$ confidence level for a WIMP mass of $30\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$. We achieve a best median sensitivity of $1.4\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a $41\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ WIMP. Compared to the result from the first XENONnT science dataset, we improve our sensitivity by a factor of up to 1.8.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum at NLO in single field inflation: conservation and squeezed limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we computed the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation, and found logarithmic infrared contributions that diverge in both large physical distances and squeezed limit where one momentum vanishes. In this work, we provide an independent test of the result by checking its conservation and the validity of the consistency relation between the squeezed limit of the bispectrum and the square of the power spectrum. Despite the violation of the main assumption for its general proofs which is the finiteness of the relevant observables in these limits, we find that the identity continues to hold in the vicinity of the squeezed limit and large time.</description>

      <title>Exploring sub-GeV dark matter via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance annihilation with CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit constraints on sub-GeV dark matter (DM) annihilation via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance processes using current and future CMB data from Planck, FIRAS, and upcoming experiments as LiteBird, CMB-S4, PRISTINE, and PIXIE. For $s$-wave annihilation, we provide updated limits for both $e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\pi\pi$ channels, with the profile likelihood method yielding stronger constraints than marginal posterior method. In the $p$-wave case, we comprehensively conduct a model-independent inequality for the 95\% upper limits from FIRAS, PRISTINE, and PIXIE, with future experiments expected to surpass current BBN limits. For resonance annihilation, we report -- for the first time -- the $95\%$ upper limits on the decay branching ratio of the mediator particle, when resonances peak during the recombination epoch. Overall, our study highlights the complementary strengths of $\mu$-distortion and CMB anisotropies in probing sub-GeV DM annihilation.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, Bardeen and Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing early universe evolution with gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of self-interactions on the shape and oscillations of the solitonic core profile of condensed fuzzy dark matter systems without the backdrop of a halo, revealing universal features in terms of an appropriately scaled interaction strength characterizing the crossover between the weakly- and strongly-interacting regimes. Our semi-analytical results are further confirmed by spherically symmetric simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations. Inverting our obtained relations, we highlight a degeneracy that could significantly affect constraints on the boson mass in the presence of repulsive boson self-interactions and propose the simultaneous extraction of static and dynamical solitonic features as a way to uniquely constrain both the boson mass and self-interactions.</description>

Abstract: Scale-independent energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) allows different gravitational couplings for different types of sources and has been proven to have interesting implications in cosmology. In this paper, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism and the latest observational constraints on nuclear abundances are being used to put bounds on this class of modified gravity models. Using the tight constraint from BBN on the correction term in the Friedmann equation in EMSG scenario, we report the allowed deviation from the standard cosmic expansion rate.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have excelled at diverse image generation and reconstruction tasks across fields. A less explored avenue is their application to discriminative tasks involving regression or classification problems. The cornerstone of modern cosmology is the ability to generate predictions for observed astrophysical fields from theory and constrain physical models from observations using these predictions. This work uses a single diffusion generative model to address these interlinked objectives -- as a surrogate model or emulator for cold dark matter density fields conditional on input cosmological parameters, and as a parameter inference model that solves the inverse problem of constraining the cosmological parameters of an input field. The model is able to emulate fields with summary statistics consistent with those of the simulated target distribution. We then leverage the approximate likelihood of the diffusion generative model to derive tight constraints on cosmology by using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior on cosmological parameters for a given test image. Finally, we demonstrate that this parameter inference approach is more robust to small perturbations of noise to the field than baseline parameter inference networks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the $L$-$\sigma$ Relation of HII Galaxies for improving cosmological application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basic premise of using HII starburst galaxies (HIIGs) as cosmic ``standard candles'' is the significant correlation between the H$\beta$ luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the ionized gas from HIIGs measurements, which can be called as the empirical $L$ - $\sigma$ relation. However, the classic scaling $L$ - $\sigma$ relation well-calibrated with the low-redshift HIIGs is unfitted for the high-redshift ones. To solve this problem, we try to explore new relational expression for the $L$ - $\sigma$ relation, which is expected to be suitable for both the low and high redshift HIIGs. After reconstructing the Hubble diagram with the Gaussian process method from the Pantheon+ supernovae Ia sample, we compare three different revised forms of the $L$ - $\sigma$ relation with the classic scaling one. By using the Bayesian evidence to do the comparison, we find that the logarithmic redshift-dependent correction is the most competitive option for the $L$ - $\sigma$ relation. Then, we conduct the cosmological analysis with a joint sample of HIIGs and local giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHRs) in the case of choosing the logarithmic redshift-dependent form for the $L$ - $\sigma$ relation, and find that the power of HIIGs $+$ GEHRs on constraining the Hubble constant is almost compatible with that of the observational Hubble parameter data. It suggests that the appropriate optimization to the classic $L$ - $\sigma$ relation should be taken into account when the HIIGs are used as a kind of promising cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>The Effects of AGN Feedback on the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest Flux Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of AGN feedback on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power spectrum (P1D). Using the Simba cosmological-hydrodynamic simulations, we examine the impact that adding different AGN feedback modes has on the predicted P1D. We find that, for Simba, the impact of AGN feedback is most dramatic at lower redshifts ($z&lt;1$) and that AGN jet feedback plays the most significant role in altering the P1D. The effects of AGN feedback can be seen across a large range of wavenumbers ($1.5\times10^{-3}&lt;k&lt;10^{-1}$ s/km) changing the ionization state of hydrogen in the IGM through heating. AGN feedback can also alter the thermal evolution of the IGM and thermally broaden individual Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. For the Simba model, these effects become observable at $z \lesssim 1.0$. At higher redshifts ($z&gt;2.0$), AGN feedback has a $2\%$ effect on the P1D for $k&lt;5\times10^{-2}$ s/km and an $8\%$ effect for $k&gt;5\times10^{-2}$ s/km. We show that the small scale effect is reduced when normalizing the simulation to the observed mean flux. On large scales, the effect of AGN feedback appears via a change in the IGM temperature and is thus unlikely to bias cosmological parameters. The strong AGN jets in the Simba simulation can reproduce the $z&gt;2$ Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We stress that analyses comparing different AGN feedback models to future higher precision data will be necessary to determine the full extent of this effect.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger Cosmology: A Route to Accurate Inference of Dark Energy Beyond CPL Parametrization from XG Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the central challenges in modern cosmology is understanding the nature of dark energy and its evolution throughout the history of the Universe. Dark energy is commonly modeled as a perfect fluid with a time-varying equation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$, often modeled under CPL parametrization using two parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. In this study, we explore both parametric and non-parametric methods to reconstruct the dark energy Equation of State (EoS) using Gravitational Wave (GW) sources, with and without electromagnetic (EM) counterparts called bright sirens and dark sirens respectively. In the parametric approach, we extend the widely used $w_0$-$w_a$ model by introducing an additional term, $w_b$, to better capture the evolving dynamics of dark energy up to high redshift which is accessible from GW sources. This extension provides increased flexibility in modeling the EoS and enables a more detailed investigation of dark energy's evolution. Our analysis indicates that, with five years of observation time and a $75\%$ duty cycle using Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, it will be possible to measure the dark energy EoS with remarkable precision, better than any other cosmological probe in the coming years, from bright standard sirens using a multi-messenger approach. These findings highlight the potential of GW observations in synergy with EM telescopes to offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy, overcoming the current limitations in cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>The role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>The evolution of galaxy morphology from redshift z=6 to 3: Mock JWST observations of galaxies in the ASTRID simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present mock JWST observations for more than 250,000 different galaxies from the Astrid simulation with $3 \leq z \leq 6$. The mock observations are made using the BPASS stellar SED model, and a simple dust model. They are then viewed through NIRCam filters, convolved with a PSF, have noise added, and are drizzled together to emulate the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We analyse this dataset by computing a number of morphological measures and find our catalog to have comparable statistics to similar mock catalogs, and the first release of CEERS data. We find that most of the Sersic indices of galaxies in our redshift range are lower than observed, with most having n less than one. Additionally, we observe the sizes of galaxies of all masses to increase from redshift z=6 to redshift z=3 consistent with other results. The number of galaxies in our catalog allows us to examine how relationships like the mass-size relation evolve with redshift, and compare the accuracy of a variety of traditional galaxy classification techniques (Sersic fit, Asymmetry-Concentration, and Gini-$M_{20}$) within our redshift range. We find the mass-size relation to be nearly flat at redshift z=6, and consistently increases as redshift decreases, and find the galaxy classification methods have minimal correlation with each other in our redshift range. We also investigate the impact that different stages of our imaging pipeline have on these morphological measures to determine how robust mock catalogs are to different choices at each step. Finally, we test the addition of incorporating light from AGNs into our pipeline and find that while the population of galaxies that have significant AGN luminosity is low, those galaxies do tend to have higher Sersic indices once the AGN luminosity is added, rectifying some of the systematic bias towards lower Sersic indices present in our dataset.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Limits from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Axion-like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are constrained by requirements of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) as their decays significantly impact the formation of the primordial elements. We propose here a model where the primary decay channel for the HNLs is to an axion-like particle (ALP) and a neutrino. Consequently, HNLs can decay earlier and evade the BBN bound for lower masses, provided the ALPs themselves decay considerably later. Further cosmological and astrophysical constraints limit severely the range of validity of the ALP properties. We find that a new parameter region opens up for HNLs with masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, and active-sterile neutrino mixing strengths between $10^{-9}$ and $10^{-6}$ that is consistent with constraints and can be probed in future searches. In such a scenario, current bounds as well as sensitivities of future direct HNL searches such as at NA62 and DUNE will be affected.</description>

      <title>Precise predictions for the QCD axion contribution to dark radiation with full phase-space evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the QCD axion contribution to the energy density of dark radiation, parameterized by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, by solving Boltzmann equations for the momentum distribution functions including the effects of quantum statistics for all particles involved in the axion production processes. This approach gives precise prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ independently on whether axions are produced via freeze-out or freeze-in. We focus on axions produced via flavor-conserving and flavor-violating interactions with leptons. Our precise predictions for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can differ from those assuming thermal shape for the momentum distribution functions, as commonly done in the literature, by more than the experimental precision of future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Current lower limits on the axion couplings from Planck constraints on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ are also affected by our precise computation which, in particular, results in a strongly relaxed bound on flavor-violating axion couplings to tau lepton and muon or electron.</description>

      <title>To bounce or not to bounce in generalized Proca theory and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is notoriously difficult to construct a stable non-singular bouncing cosmology that avoids all possible instabilities throughout the entire evolution of the universe. In this work, we explore whether a non-singular bounce driven by a specific class of modifications of General Relativity, the vector-tensor generalized Proca theories, can be constructed without encountering any pathologies in linear perturbation theory. We find that such models unavoidably lead either to strong coupling in the tensor or the scalar sector, or instabilities in the matter sector during the bouncing phase. As our analysis is performed in a gauge-independent way, this result can be cast in the form of a no-go theorem for non-singular bounces with generalized Proca. In contrast to the no-go theorem found for Horndeski theories, however, it cannot be evaded by considering beyond generalized Proca theory. At the core of our result lies the non-dynamical nature of the temporal component of the vector field, which renders it an ill-suited mediator for a bouncing solution.</description>
