      <title>On cat-human interaction from the viewpoint of physics: an equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an enjoyable example through which several concepts of classical mechanics can be understood. We introduce an equation that models the motion of a cat in the presence of a person. The cat is considered as a point particle moving in a potential induced by the person. We demonstrate that this approach to the problem reproduces characteristic behaviors of these curious animals. For instance, the fact that cats do not typically come when they are called, or that they remain longer on the lap of their favorite person; even ``zoomies" are reproduced (cats randomly run back and forth across the house). We use this model problem to explore topics of current research such as stochastic equations and periodically driven systems. The pedagogical value of this work and its potential use in teaching are discussed.</description>

      <title>Convergence in divergent series related to perturbation methods using continued exponential and Shanks transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divergent solutions are ubiquitous with perturbation methods. We use continued function such as continued exponential to converge divergent series in perturbation approaches for energy eigenvalues of Helium, Stark effect and Zeeman effect on Hydrogen. We observe that convergence properties are obtained similar to that of the Pad\'e approximation which is extensively used in literature. Free parameters are not used which influence the convergence and only first few terms in the perturbation series are implemented.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Analysis of the Uncertainty Contribution from Mechanical Imperfections in the LNE's Thompson-Lampard Calculable Capacitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thompson-Lampard type calculable capacitors (TLCC) serve as electrical capacitance standards, enabling the realization of the farad in the International System of Units (SI) with a combined uncertainty on the order of one part in $10^8$. This paper presents an electrostatic finite element (FEM) simulation study focusing on the mechanical imperfections inherent in the developed second generation TLCC at LNE and their influence on the combined uncertainty of the practical realization of the farad. In particular, this study establishes the acceptable tolerances for deviations from perfect geometrical arrangements of the TLCC electrodes required to achieve the target relative uncertainty of one part in $10^8$. The simulation predictions are compared with corresponding experimental observations which were conducted with the help of the sub-micron level control of the standard's electrode geometry. In the second generation of the LNE's TLCC, the uncertainty contribution from mechanical imperfections was reduced by at least a factor of 4, as demonstrated by the present FEM analysis. Combined with other improvements, the standard's overall uncertainty meets the target level.</description>
