      <title>On twisting functions in twisted cartesian products and twisted tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given twisted cartesian products of simplicial sets, we construct the corresponding twisted tensor product in the sense of Brown, with an explicit twisting function whose formula is simple without using inductions. This is done by choosing an explicit morphism of topological monoids from Kan's loop group to Moore loop spaces, following Berger's work on simplicial prisms. We follow the choice of Brown and Berger on such a morphism, which is different from that of Gugenheim and Szczarba.</description>

      <title>The operad associated to a crossed simplicial group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study structured enhancement of the notion of a crossed simplicial group, which we call an operadic crossed simplicial group. We show that with each operadic crossed simplicial group one can associate a certain operad in groupoids. We demonstrate that symmetric and braid crossed simplicial groups can be made into operadic crossed simplicial groups in a natural way. For these two examples, we show that our construction of the associated operad recovers the $E_\infty$-operad and the $E_2$-operad respectively. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through two main applications: a generalized bar construction that specializes to Fiedorowicz's symmetric and braided bar constructions, and an identification of the associated group-completed monads with Baratt-Priddy-Quillen type spaces.</description>

      <title>Stable cohomology of universal character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the universal PGL_n$character variety over M_g whose fiber over a point [C] is the space of PGL_n-local systems on the curve C. We use nonabelian Hodge theory and properties of Saito's mixed Hodge modules to show that the Leray-Serre spectral sequence for the projection to M_g degenerates at E_2. As an application, we prove that the rational cohomology of these varieties stabilizes as g goes to infinity and compute the stable limit. We also deduce similar results for the universal G-character variety over M_{g,1} whose fiber over a punctured curve is the variety of G-local systems with fixed central monodromy around the puncture, for G = GL_n or SL_n.</description>

      <title>Notions of simple type for Bauer--Furuta invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By extending the notion of simple type for the Seiberg--Witten invariant of a 4-manifold, we introduce notions of BF blowup simple type and BF homogeneous type for the Bauer--Furuta invariant and study their applications. Specifically, we show that the existence of an immersed 2-sphere with a certain condition guarantees BF blowup simple type. As an application, we determine the Bauer--Furuta invariant of a 4-manifold obtained by a logarithmic transformation along a torus in a fishtail neighborhood. We also give constraints on gluing decompositions of 4-manifolds by using BF homogeneous type. To prove these results, we also give gluing formulae and an immersed adjunction inequality for Bauer--Furuta invariants.</description>

      <title>TUN: Detecting Significant Points in Persistence Diagrams with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistence diagrams (PDs) provide a powerful tool for understanding the topology of the underlying shape of a point cloud. However, identifying which points in PDs encode genuine signals remains challenging. This challenge directly hinders the practical adoption of topological data analysis in many applications, where automated and reliable interpretation of persistence diagrams is essential for downstream decision-making. In this paper, we study automatic significance detection for one-dimensional persistence diagrams. Specifically, we propose Topology Understanding Net (TUN), a multi-modal network that combines enhanced PD descriptors with self-attention, a PointNet-style point cloud encoder, learned fusion, and per-point classification, alongside stable preprocessing and imbalance-aware training. It provides an automated and effective solution for identifying significant points in PDs, which are critical for downstream applications. Experiments show that TUN outperforms classic methods in detecting significant points in PDs, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Condensed mathematics through compactological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their 2022 lecture notes on condensed sets, Clausen and Scholze mentioned in a remark that the important subclass of quasiseparated condensed sets is equivalent to the category of so-called compactological spaces defined by Waelbroeck in the 1960s. In this paper we survey the latter category in detail, we give a rigorous proof of Clausen and Scholze's claim, and we establish that condensed sets are a formal categorical completion of Waelbroeck's compactological spaces. The latter answers a question asked by Hanson in 2023 and permits the interpretation of compactological sets as an 'elementary' approach to condensed mathematics.</description>

      <title>Real topological Hochschild homology via the norm and Real Witt vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Real topological Hochschild homology can be characterized as the norm from the cyclic group of order $2$ to the orthogonal group $O(2)$. From this perspective, we then prove a multiplicative double coset formula for the restriction of this norm to dihedral groups of order $2m$. This informs our new definition of Real Hochschild homology of rings with anti-involution, which we show is the algebraic analogue of Real topological Hochschild homology. Using extra structure on Real Hochschild homology, we define a new theory of $p$-typical Witt vectors of rings with anti-involution. We end with an explicit computation of the degree zero $D_{2m}$-Mackey functor homotopy groups of $\operatorname{THR}(\underline{\mathbb{Z}})$ for $m$ odd. This uses a Tambara reciprocity formula for sums for general finite groups, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Lie algebra homology with coefficients tensor products of the adjoint representation in relative polynomial degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03453v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles.
  There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1.
  This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</description>

Abstract: We will use the tools developed in [Rie24] to give a Morse-theoretic description of a string topology product on the homology of the space of paths in a manifold Y with endpoints in a submanifold X and a module structure on this homology over the Chas-Sullivan ring of Y . These operations have been defined and studied by Stegemeyer in [Ste25] in singular homology.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Banach-bundle germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a continuous bundle $\mathcal{E}\to X$ of Banach/Hilbert spaces or Banach/$C^*$-algebras over a paracompact base space, equivariant for a compact Lie group $\mathbb{U}$ operating on all structures involved. We prove that in all cases homogeneous equivariant subbundles extend equivariantly from $\mathbb{U}$-invariant closed subsets of $X$ to closed invariant neighborhoods thereof (provided the fibers are semisimple in the Banach-algebra variant). This extends a number of results in the literature (due to Fell for non-equivariant local extensibility around a single point for $C^*$-algebras and the author for semisimple Banach algebras). The proofs are based in part on auxiliary results on (a) the extensibility of equivariant compact-Lie-group principal bundles locally around invariant closed subsets of paracompact spaces, as a consequence of equivariant-bundle classifying spaces being absolute neighborhood extensors in the relevant setting and (b) an equivariant-bundle version of Johnson's approximability of almost-multiplicative maps from finite-dimensional semisimple Banach algebras with Banach morphisms.</description>

Abstract: We prove a refinement of Quillen's Theorem A, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for a functor to be cofinal with respect to diagrams valued in a fixed $\infty$-category. We deduce this from a general duality phenomenon for weighted colimits, which is of independent interest. As a sample application, due to Betts and Dan-Cohen, we describe a simplified formula for the free $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-algebra on an $\mathbb{E}_0$-algebra in a stable rational $\infty$-category .</description>

      <title>Real isotropic motivic spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the category of real isotropic motivic spectra, and show that the real realization functor from motivic spectra over $\mathbb{R}$ to classical spectra factors through it. We then describe its cellular subcategory as a one-parameter deformation of the category of spectra, with parameter $\rho$ corresponding to $-1 \in \mathbb{R}^{\times}$, whose special fiber is the derived category of comodules over the dual Steenrod algebra. This leads to an identification of real isotropic cellular spectra with $\mathbb{F}_2$-synthetic spectra, and sheds light on the relation between motivic homotopy theory over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{F}_2$-synthetic homotopy theory.</description>
