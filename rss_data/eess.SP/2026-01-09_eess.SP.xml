      <title>Towards Radar-Agnostic Gait Analysis Across UWB and FMCW Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar sensing has emerged in recent years as a promising solution for unobtrusive and continuous in-home gait monitoring. This study evaluates whether a unified processing framework can be applied to radar-based spatiotemporal gait analysis independent of radar modality. The framework is validated using collocated impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) and frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars under identical processing settings, without modality-specific tuning, during repeated overground walking trials with 10 healthy participants. A modality-independent approach for automatic walking-segment identification is also introduced to ensure fair and reproducible modality performance assessment. Clinically relevant spatiotemporal gait parameters, including stride time, stride length, walking speed, swing time, and stance time, extracted from each modality were compared against gold-standard motion capture reference estimates. Across all parameters, both radar modalities achieved comparably high mean estimation accuracy in the range of 85-98%, with inter-modality differences remaining below 4.1%, resulting in highly overlapping accuracy distributions. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses revealed minimal bias, comparable limits of agreement, and strong agreement with reference estimates, while intraclass correlation analysis demonstrated high consistency between radar modalities. These findings indicate that no practically meaningful performance differences arise from radar modality when using a shared processing framework, supporting the feasibility of radar-agnostic gait analysis systems.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Cellular Malignancy Using Electrical Impedance Signatures and Supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioelectrical properties of cells such as relative permittivity, conductivity, and characteristic time constants vary significantly between healthy and malignant cells across different frequencies. These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification.</description>

      <title>Invisible Walls: Privacy-Preserving ISAC Empowered by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environmental and target-related information inherently carried in wireless signals, such as channel state information (CSI), has brought increasing attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC.</description>

      <title>Spectral point transformer for significant wave height estimation from sea clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for estimating significant wave height (Hs) from sparse S_pectral P_oint using a T_ransformer-based approach (SPT). Based on empirical observations that only a minority of spectral points with strong power contribute to wave energy, the proposed SPT effectively integrates geometric and spectral characteristics of ocean surface waves to estimate Hs through multi-dimensional feature representation. The experiment reveals an intriguing phenomenon: the learned features of SPT align well with physical dispersion relations, where the contribution-score map of selected points is concentrated along dispersion curves. Compared to conventional vision networks that process image sequences and full spectra, SPT demonstrates superior performance in Hs regression while consuming significantly fewer computational resources. On a consumer-grade GPU, SPT completes the training of regression model for 1080 sea clutter image sequences within 4 minutes, showcasing its potential to reduce deployment costs for radar wave-measuring systems. The open-source implementation of SPT will be available at https://github.com/joeyee/spt</description>

      <title>MIMO Beam Map Reconstruction via Toeplitz-Structured Matrix-Vector Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless networks progress toward sixthgeneration (6G), understanding the spatial distribution of directional beam coverage becomes increasingly important for beam management and link optimization. Multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) beam map provides such spatial awareness, yet accurate construction under sparse measurements remains difficult due to incomplete spatial coverage and strong angular variations. This paper presents a tensor decomposition approach for reconstructing MIMO beam map from limited measurements. By transforming measurements from a Cartesian coordinate system into a polar coordinate system, we uncover a matrix-vector outer-product structure associated with different propagation conditions. Specifically, we mathematically demonstrate that the matrix factor, representing beam-space gain, exhibits an intrinsic Toeplitz structure due to the shift-invariant nature of array responses, and the vector factor captures distance-dependent attenuation. Leveraging these structural priors, we formulate a regularized tensor decomposition problem to jointly reconstruct line-of-sight (LOS), reflection, and obstruction propagation conditions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency, achieving a normalized mean square error (NMSE) reduction of over 20% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, even under sparse sampling regimes.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Fast MLE for Low SNR Multi-Reference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, multi-reference alignment (MRA) models the task of recovering an unknown signal from multiple noisy observations corrupted by random rotations. The standard approach, expectation-maximization (EM), often becomes computationally prohibitive, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. We introduce an alternative, ultra-fast algorithm for MRA over the special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(2)$. By performing a Taylor expansion of the log-likelihood in the low-SNR regime, we estimate the signal by sequentially computing data-driven averages of observations. Our method requires only one pass over the data, dramatically reducing computational cost compared to EM. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in low-SNR environments and provides an excellent initialization for subsequent EM refinement.</description>

      <title>SE-EE Tradeoff in Pinching-Antenna Systems: Waveguide Multiplexing or Waveguide Switching?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral and energy efficiency (SE-EE) trade-off in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is investigated in this paper. In particular, two practical operating protocols, namely waveguide multiplexing (WM) and waveguide switching (WS), are considered. A multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated to jointly optimize the baseband and pinching beamforming for maximizing the achievable SE and EE, which is then converted into a single-objective problem via the {\epsilon}-constraint method. For WM, the problem is decomposed within the alternating-optimization framework, where the baseband beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation, and the pinching beamforming is updated through the particle swarm optimization. For WS, due to the time-division transmission and interference-free nature, the pinching beamforming in each time slot is first adjusted to maximize the served user channel gain, followed by the baseband power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) PASS outperforms conventional antennas by mitigating large-scale path losses; 2) WS leads to a higher maximum achievable EE by activating a single RF chain, whereas WM yields a higher SE upper bound by serving all users concurrently; and 3) increasing the number of users substantially enhances SE under WM, whereas WS shows more pronounced benefits in low-signal-to-noise ratio regimes.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Antenna Enhanced Cell-free MIMO: Two-timescale Decentralized Beamforming and Antenna Movement Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-aided cell-free multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system. In this system, each distributed access point (AP) can flexibly adjust its array orientation and antenna positions to adapt to spatial channel variations and enhance communication performance. However, frequent antenna movements and centralized beamforming based on global instantaneous channel state information (CSI) sharing among APs entail extremely high signal processing delay and system overhead, which is difficult to be practically implemented in high-mobility scenarios with short channel coherence time. To address these practical implementation challenges and improve scalability, a two-timescale decentralized optimization framework is proposed in this paper to jointly design the beamformer, antenna positions, and array orientations. In the short timescale, each AP updates its receive beamformer based on local instantaneous CSI and global statistical CSI. In the long timescale, the central processing unit optimizes the antenna positions and array orientations at all APs based on global statistical CSI to maximize the ergodic sum rate of all users. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, thus posing significant challenges for obtaining efficient solutions. To address this problem, a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation algorithm is developed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed 6DMA-aided cell-free system with decentralized beamforming significantly outperforms other antenna movement schemes with less flexibility and even achieves a performance comparable to that of the centralized beamforming benchmark.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Channel Aging and Doppler-Affected Clutter on OFDM ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.</description>

      <title>Multi-band Carrier Phase Positioning toward 6G: Performance Bounds and Efficient Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to satellite systems, carrier phase positioning (CPP) is gaining attraction also in terrestrial mobile networks, particularly in 5G New Radio evolution toward 6G. One key challenge is to resolve the integer ambiguity problem, as the carrier phase provides only relative position information. This work introduces and studies a multi-band CPP scenario with intra- and inter-band carrier aggregation (CA) opportunities across FR1, mmWave-FR2, and emerging 6G FR3 bands. Specifically, we derive multi-band CPP performance bounds, showcasing the superiority of multi-band CPP for high-precision localization in current and future mobile networks, while noting also practical imperfections such as clock offsets between the user equipment (UE) and the network as well as mutual clock imperfections between the network nodes. A wide collection of numerical results is provided, covering the impacts of the available carrier bandwidth, number of aggregated carriers, transmit power, and the number of network nodes or base stations. The offered results highlight that only two carriers suffice to substantially facilitate resolving the integer ambiguity problem while also largely enhancing the robustness of positioning against imperfections imposed by the network-side clocks and multi-path propagation. In addition, we also propose a two-stage practical estimator that achieves the derived bounds under all realistic bandwidth and transmit power conditions. Furthermore, we show that with an additional search-based refinement step, the proposed estimator becomes particularly suitable for narrowband Internet of Things applications operating efficiently even under narrow carrier bandwidths. Finally, both the derived bounds and the proposed estimators are extended to scenarios where the bands assigned to each base station are nonuniform or fully disjoint, enhancing the practical deployment flexibility.</description>

      <title>Achievable Rate and Coding Principle for MIMO Multicarrier Systems With Cross-Domain MAMP Receiver Over Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of multicarrier modulation and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for reliable transmission of wireless signals in complex environments, which significantly improve spectrum efficiency. Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Detecting Cyberattacks on Smart Grid Protective Relays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a large language model (LLM)-based framework for detecting cyberattacks on transformer current differential relays (TCDRs), which, if undetected, may trigger false tripping of critical transformers. The proposed approach adapts and fine-tunes compact LLMs such as DistilBERT to distinguish cyberattacks from actual faults using textualized multidimensional TCDR current measurements recorded before and after tripping. Our results demonstrate that DistilBERT detects 97.6% of cyberattacks without compromising TCDR dependability and achieves inference latency below 6 ms on a commercial workstation. Additional evaluations confirm the framework's robustness under combined time-synchronization and false-data-injection attacks, resilience to measurement noise, and stability across prompt formulation variants. Furthermore, GPT-2 and DistilBERT+LoRA achieve comparable performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs for enhancing smart grid cybersecurity. We provide the full dataset used in this study for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Federated Learning for Noise-Robust Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and federated distillation (FD) are distributed learning paradigms that train UE models with enhanced privacy, each offering different trade-offs between noise robustness and learning speed. To mitigate their respective weaknesses, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework in which each user equipment (UE) transmits either gradients or logits, and the base station (BS) selects the per-round weights of FL and FD updates. We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study Regarding Self-sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Without requiring operational costs such as cabling and powering while maintaining reconfigurable phase-shift capability, self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ssRISs) can be deployed in locations inaccessible to conventional relays or base stations, offering a novel approach to enhance wireless coverage. This study assesses the feasibility of ssRIS deployment by analyzing two harvest-and-reflect (HaR) schemes: element-splitting (ES) and time-splitting (TS). We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness.</description>

      <title>Learning Sparsifying Transforms for mmWave Communication via $\ell^4$-Norm Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high directionality of wave propagation at millimeter-wave (mmWave) carrier frequencies results in only a small number of significant transmission paths between user equipments and the basestation (BS). This sparse nature of wave propagation is revealed in the beamspace domain, which is traditionally obtained by taking the spatial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) across a uniform linear antenna array at the BS, where each DFT output is associated with a distinct beam. In recent years, beamspace processing has emerged as a promising technique to reduce baseband complexity and power consumption in all-digital massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating at mmWave frequencies. However, it remains unclear whether the DFT is the optimal sparsifying transform for finite-dimensional antenna arrays. In this paper, we extend the framework of Zhai et al. for complete dictionary learning via $\ell^4$-norm maximization to the complex case in order to learn new sparsifying transforms. We provide a theoretical foundation for $\ell^4$-norm maximization and propose two suitable learning algorithms. We then utilize these algorithms (i) to assess the optimality of the DFT for sparsifying channel vectors theoretically and via simulations and (ii) to learn improved sparsifying transforms for real-world and synthetically generated channel vectors.</description>

      <title>Driver-Intention Prediction with Deep Learning: Real-Time Brain-to-Vehicle Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and electronics without the need for speech or physical movement. Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing. Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in distinguishing between the three steering intentions and demonstrated the ability of CNNs to process raw EEG data effectively. The classification accuracy was highest for right-turn segments, which suggests a potential spatial bias in brain activity. This study lays the foundation for more intuitive brain-to-vehicle communication systems.</description>

      <title>Sizing Antenna Arrays for Near-field Communication and Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents key performance metrics for near-field communication and sensing systems and their scaling behavior as a function of the antenna array aperture. Analytical expressions are derived for several standard array geometries to ease the design of the large antenna arrays under given system requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the minimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as the array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown to scale quadratically with the array aperture. Based on these two metrics, the maximum number of resolvable beamspots at 3 dB separation is derived analytically, exhibiting a linear dependence on the array aperture. Moreover, when considering a region where the beamfocusing resolution does not exceed a specified threshold, the extent of the region is also shown to scale linearly with the array size. Finally, the number of significant singular values of a channel observed at the array's broadside is estimated, showing a power-law dependence on the aperture. The resulting expressions provide practical design guidelines for evaluating aperture requirements in near-field communication and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Integrated Polarimetric Sensing and Communication with Polarization-Reconfigurable Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization diversity offers a cost- and space-efficient solution to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication systems. Polarimetric sensing exploits the signal's polarity to extract details about the target such as shape, pose, and material composition. From a communication perspective, polarization diversity can enhance the reliability and throughput of communication channels. This paper proposes an integrated polarimetric sensing and communication (IPSAC) system that jointly conducts polarimetric sensing and communications. We study the use of single-port polarization-reconfigurable antennas to adapt to channel depolarization effects, without the need for separate RF chains for each polarization. We address two core sensing tasks in IPSAC systems, target parameter estimation and target detection. For parameter estimation, we consider the problem of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) of the target depolarization parameter estimate, which is a critical task for various polarimetric radar applications such as rainfall forecasting, vegetation identification, and target classification. To address this nonconvex problem, we apply semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) optimization techniques. Next, we consider a design that maximizes the target SINR leveraging prior knowledge of the target and clutter depolarization statistics to enhance the target detection performance. To tackle this problem, we modify the solution developed for MSE minimization subject to the same quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Extensive simulations show that the proposed polarization reconfiguration method substantially improves the depolarization parameter MSE. Furthermore, the proposed method considerably boosts the target SINR due to polarization diversity, particularly in cluttered environments.</description>

      <title>Sensing for Free: Learn to Localize More Sources than Antennas without Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a key paradigm for future wireless networks. However, existing approaches require waveform modifications, dedicated pilots, or overhead that complicates standards integration. We propose sensing for free - performing multi-source localization without pilots by reusing uplink data symbols, making sensing occur during transmission and directly compatible with 3GPP 5G NR and 6G specifications. With ever-increasing devices in dense 6G networks, this approach is particularly compelling when combined with sparse arrays, which can localize more sources than uniform arrays via an enlarged virtual array. Existing pilot-free multi-source localization algorithms first reconstruct an extended covariance matrix and apply subspace methods, incurring cubic complexity and limited to second-order statistics. Performance degrades under non-Gaussian data symbols and few snapshots, and higher-order statistics remain unexploited. We address these challenges with an attention-only transformer that directly processes raw signal snapshots for grid-less end-to-end direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The model efficiently captures higher-order statistics while being permutation-invariant and adaptive to varying snapshot counts. Our algorithm greatly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-based benchmarks with over 30x reduction in parameters and runtime, and enjoys excellent generalization under practical mismatches. Applied to multi-user MIMO beam training, our algorithm can localize uplink DOAs of multiple users during data transmission. Through angular reciprocity, estimated uplink DOAs prune downlink beam sweeping candidates and improve throughput via sensing-assisted beam management. This work shows how reusing existing data transmission for sensing can enhance both multi-source localization and beam management in 3GPP efforts towards 6G.</description>

      <title>RadarPLM: Adapting Pre-trained Language Models for Marine Radar Target Detection by Selective Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12089v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated their capabilities in capturing universal knowledge, making them promising for radar signal processing applications. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning PLMs on radar signals is both computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, particularly in low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) environments. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning framework for PLM-based marine radar target detection. First, we design a lightweight adaptation module, enabling computationally efficient fine-tuning while preserving the pre-trained model's general knowledge. Second, a novel preference-aware loss is developed to selectively optimize different feature patches based on their online-evaluated learning values, guiding the model to concentrate on those generalizable feature patterns during optimization. Finally, a binary classification head is retrained based on autoencoder network to further enhance detection performance. Experiments on real-world radar data show that the proposed RadarPLM framework yields at least a 6.35% improvement in detection performance over the existing networks under low SCR conditions. Especially, in the small-sample training cases, the proposed RadarPLM also achieves a significant advantage over existing networks owing to the incorporation of the PLM.</description>

      <title>Filter-and-Attend: Wireless Channel Foundation Model with Noise-Plus-Interference Suppression Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless channel foundation model (WCFM) is a task-agnostic AI model that is pre-trained to learn a universal channel representation for a wide range of communications and sensing tasks. While existing works on WCFM have demonstrated its great potentials in various downstream tasks, the models are all trained using perfect (i.e., error-free and complete) channel information state (CSI) data. In practical systems, however, only degraded CSI obtained from pilot-based channel estimation is accessible, leading to distorted channel representations and performance degradation in downstream tasks for some real-world environments with severe noise and interference. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new paradigm for WCFM, termed as Filter-and-Attend. In this paradigm, Filter refers to explicitly suppressing noise-plus-interference (NPI) in the received signals, while Attend means performing correlation-aware CSI completion and feature extraction using attention mechanism. Specifically, an enhanced WCFM architecture is developed. In this architecture, coarse estimates of the CSIs are first obtained and exploited to construct two projection matrices that extract NPI components in the received signals, which are further processed and removed by a subtraction module. The filtered signal is subsequently passed through a CSI completion network to get a clean CSI for feature extraction. Simulation results demonstrated that compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, WCFM with NPI suppression structure achieves improved performance on various downstream tasks including time-domain channel prediction, frequency-domain channel prediction, and localization.</description>

      <title>AI Signal Processing Paradigm for Movable Antenna: From Spatial Position Optimization to Electromagnetic Reconfigurability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As 6G wireless communication systems evolve toward intelligence, high reconfigurability, and space-air-ground integration \cite{liu2025toward, liu2024near}, the limitations of traditional fixed antenna (TFA) have become increasingly prominent. As a remedy, spatially movable antenna (SMA) and electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) have respectively emerged as key technologies to break through this bottleneck. SMA activates spatial degree of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting antenna positions, ERA regulates radiation characteristics using tunable metamaterials, thereby introducing DoF in the electromagnetic domain. However, the ``spatial-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration" paradigm formed by their integration poses severe challenges of high-dimensional hybrid optimization to signal processing. To address this issue, we integrate the spatial optimization of SMA and the electromagnetic reconfiguration of ERA, propose a unified modeling framework termed movable and reconfigurable antenna (MARA) and investigate the channel modeling and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization for MARA. Besides, we systematically review artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, focusing on analyzing the advantages of AI over traditional algorithms in solving high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems. This paper fills the gap in existing literature regarding the lack of a comprehensive review on the AI-driven signal processing paradigm under spatial-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration and provides theoretical guidance for the design and optimization of 6G wireless systems with advanced MARA.</description>

      <title>OptiVote: Non-Coherent FSO Over-the-Air Majority Vote for Communication-Efficient Distributed Federated Learning in Space Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.</description>

      <title>Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding Converges with Optimal Number of Measurements for 1-Bit Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressed sensing has been a very successful high-dimensional signal acquisition and recovery technique that relies on linear operations. However, the actual measurements of signals have to be quantized before storing or processing. 1(One)-bit compressed sensing is a heavily quantized version of compressed sensing, where each linear measurement of a signal is reduced to just one bit: the sign of the measurement. Once enough of such measurements are collected, the recovery problem in 1-bit compressed sensing aims to find the original signal with as much accuracy as possible. The recovery problem is related to the traditional "halfspace-learning" problem in learning theory.
  For recovery of sparse vectors, a popular reconstruction method from 1-bit measurements is the binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT) algorithm. The algorithm is a simple projected sub-gradient descent method, and is known to converge well empirically, despite the nonconvexity of the problem. The convergence property of BIHT was not theoretically justified, except with an exorbitantly large number of measurements (i.e., a number of measurement greater than $\max\{k^{10}, 24^{48}, k^{3.5}/\epsilon\}$, where $k$ is the sparsity, $\epsilon$ denotes the approximation error, and even this expression hides other factors). In this paper we show that the BIHT algorithm converges with only $\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon})$ measurements. Note that, this dependence on $k$ and $\epsilon$ is optimal for any recovery method in 1-bit compressed sensing. With this result, to the best of our knowledge, BIHT is the only practical and efficient (polynomial time) algorithm that requires the optimal number of measurements in all parameters (both $k$ and $\epsilon$). This is also an example of a gradient descent algorithm converging to the correct solution for a nonconvex problem, under suitable structural conditions.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Low-Latency Video Streaming in an ORAN Setup with Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) methods react to network congestion after it occurs, causing application layer buffering and latency spikes in live video streaming. We introduce a proactive semantic control channel that enables coordination between Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) xApp, Mobile Edge computing (MEC), and User Equipment (UE) components for seamless live video streaming between mobile devices. When the transmitting UE experiences poor Uplink (UL) conditions, the MEC proactively instructs downscaling based on low-level RAN metrics, including channel SNR updated every millisecond, preventing buffering before it occurs. A Generative AI (GAI) module at the MEC reconstructs high-quality frames from downscaled video before forwarding to the receiving UE via the typically more robust Downlink (DL). Experimental validation on a live ORAN testbed with 50 video streams shows that our approach reduces latency tail behavior while achieving up to 4 dB improvement in PSNR and 15 points in VMAF compared to reactive ABR methods. The proactive control eliminates latency spikes exceeding 600 ms, demonstrating effective cross-layer coordination for latency-critical live video streaming.</description>
