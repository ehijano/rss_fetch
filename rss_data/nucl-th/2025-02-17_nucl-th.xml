      <title>Improvement to Generalized Separable Expansion Method in Lippmann-Schwinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials are generally not in separable form, but there is a way to convert them into separable potentials, called the generalized separable expansion (GSE). When the separable potential is substituted into a three-body Faddeev equation, which generally has two Jacobi momenta, the integral equation is conveniently reduced to a one-variable integral equation. The two-body scattering t-matrix of the conventional GSE does not have an exact singularity at the energy threshold of the two-body bound state. The newly introduced GSE improves this by treating the singularity analytically.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry and peripheral neutron-$\alpha$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate that peripheral neutron-$\alpha$ scattering at low energies can serve as a sensitive and clean probe of the long-range three-nucleon forces. To this aim, we perform {\it ab initio} quantum Monte Carlo calculations using two- and three-nucleon interactions derived in chiral effective field theory up to third expansion order. We show that the longest-range three-nucleon force stemming from the two-pion exchange plays a crucial role in the proper description of the neutron-$\alpha$ $D$-wave phase shifts. Our study reveals the predictive power of chiral symmetry in the few-body sector and opens a new direction for probing and constraining three-nucleon forces.</description>

      <title>Modeling of acceleration in heavy-ion collisions: occurrence of temperature below the Unruh temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extremely strong electric fields can be created in central collisions of heavy ions, due to which the Schwinger effect can be significant. A direct analogue of the electric field in hydrodynamics is the acceleration of the medium. Using the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) framework we model the Au-Au collisions at intermediate collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4.5-11.5\,$GeV and obtain the spatial distribution of acceleration at different time moments. The present study demonstrates that extremely high acceleration of the order of 1 GeV may be generated in both central and non-central collisions, and that the distribution exhibits a core-corona structure. Consequently, in contrast to the case with an electric field, the Unruh effect is expected to be significant. It is demonstrated that for the confined phase the temperature is less than the Unruh temperature. Conversely, in the deconfined phase, the relationship is inverse. The obtained results thus support the prediction about the existence of states with $T&lt;T_U$ at the early stages of the collision and the associated complementary description of thermalization in terms of the novel phase transition at the Unruh temperature.</description>

      <title>Effective theories for nuclei at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the application of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC), an effective field theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), to describe high-energy nuclear interactions. We first provide an introduction to the methods and language of the CGC, its role in understanding gluon saturation in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC, and its relevance in various scattering processes such as Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS). The application of the CGC effective field theory to describe hadron-hadron collisions is discussed in the scope of asymmetric \textit{dilute-dense} collisions, and Heavy-Ion Collisions in the \textit{dense-dense} limit. The review covers theoretical foundations, recent advancements, and phenomenological applications, focusing on using the CGC to determine the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions under imaginary rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we investigate the properties of an ensemble of free Dirac fermions, at finite inverse temperature $\beta$ and finite chemical potential $\mu$, undergoing rigid rotation with an imaginary angular velocity $\Omega_I$. Our purpose is to establish the analytical structure of such states, as well as the prospects (and dangers) of extrapolating results obtained under imaginary rotation to the case of real rotation. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, the state of the system is akin to a stationary system with modified inverse temperature $\beta_q = q\beta$ and the same chemical potential, where $q$ is the denominator of the irreducible fraction $\nu = \beta \Omega_I / 2\pi = p/q$. The temperature of the system becomes a fractal function of the rotation parameter, as in the case of the scalar field. The chemical potential breaks the fractalization of fermions. We also compute the thermodynamic potential $\Phi$ and associated thermodynamic functions, showing that they also exhibit fractal behavior. Finally, we evaluate the axial and helical flux through the transverse plane, generated through the vortical effects, and show that they diverge in the thermodynamic limit, in the case when $\nu = 1/q$ and $q \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Experimental Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions: A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to generation of the electric current along a magnetic field in a chirally imbalanced system of quarks. The latter is predicted by quantum chromodynamics to arise from quark interaction with non-trivial topological fluctuations of the vacuum gluonic field. The CME has been actively searched for in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, where such gluonic field fluctuations and a strong magnetic field are believed to be present. The CME-sensitive observables are unfortunately subject to a possibly large non-CME background, and firm conclusions on a CME observation have not yet been reached. In this perspective, we review the experimental status and progress in the CME search, from the initial measurements more than a decade ago, to the dedicated program of isobar collisions in 2018 and the release of the isobar blind analysis result in 2022, to intriguing hints of a possible CME signal in Au+Au collisions, and discuss future prospects of a potential CME discovery in the anticipated high-statistic Au+Au collision data at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider by 2025. We hope such a perspective will help sharpening our focus on the fundamental physics of the CME and steer its experimental search.</description>

      <title>Tomography of Pions and Kaons in the QCD Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the pion and kaon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM), a model of the QCD vacuum at low resolution. The relevant TMDs are factored into a constituent quark distribution times a rapidity dependent soft factor from staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed parton longitudinal momentum and transverse separation. The results are evolved to higher rapidities and higher resolution using the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) renormalization group evolution. The comparison to existing extractions of pion TMDs from Drell-Yan (DY) data is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity study of a sapphire detector using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment(ICNSE) has been proposed at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process using electron antineutrinos produced from reactors. Phenomenological studies are performed to find out the sensitivity of sapphire detector for various fundamental physics parameters at an exposure of one year. Reactors of different core compositions, sizes, and thermal powers have been considered as sources of electron antineutrinos. The potential of the ICNSE to measure the weak mixing angle at a low energy regime has been extracted. Furthermore, the detector's capability has been investigated for examining the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their magnetic moment. Additionally, an exploration has been conducted on the detector's sensitivity in restricting new interactions between neutrinos and electrons or nuclei, thereby constraining the parameter space related to light mediators. It is found that the ICNSE detector can put a stronger constraints on the scalar and vector mediators masses.</description>

      <title>Nuclear modification of $B_c$ mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions based on a linear Boltzmann transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) of $B_c$ mesons in high-energy nuclear collisions provides a novel probe of heavy quark interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Based on a linear Boltzmann transport model that incorporates both Yukawa and string types of interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP, we study the production and evolution of heavy quarks and $B_c$ mesons within the same framework. A $B_c$ bound state dissociates while one of its constituent heavy quarks scatters with the QGP with momentum transfer greater than its binding energy. The medium-modified charm and bottom quarks can recombine into $B_c$ mesons, and the medium-modified bottom quarks can also fragment to $B_c$ mesons. We find that most primordial $B_c$ mesons generated from the initial hard collisions dissociate inside the QGP. The production of $B_c$ mesons is primarily driven by the recombination mechanism at low transverse momentum and fragmentation at high transverse momentum. The string interaction dominates over the Yukawa interaction in the nuclear modification of $B_c$ mesons. The participant number dependence of the $B_c$ meson $R_\mathrm{AA}$ is determined by the complicated interplay between the heavy quark yield, energy loss, and the QGP volume. We obtain a reasonable description of the $R_\mathrm{AA}$ of $B_c$ mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, and provide predictions for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration in QC_2D from effective model using the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The order of the chiral phase transition in two-color and two-flavor QC$_2$D is investigated using the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique in an effective model setting. We calculate the $\beta$ function of all couplings in the dimensionally reduced Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional with Pauli-G\"ursey SU(4) symmetry. We compare results of the perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion approach with those obtained via the FRG, evaluated directly in $d=3$ dimensions. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. Both methods display an infrared stable $O(6)$ fixed point at infinite axial anomaly; however, the FRG approach also reveals the existence of $U_A(1)$ anomaly-free fixed points, which can become infrared stable if the anomaly in the underlying theory vanishes at the critical temperature. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors.</description>

      <title>Pion condensation versus 2SC, speed of sound, and charge neutrality effects in the quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model as a low-energy model for QCD at non-zero quark and isospin chemical potentials $\mu$ and $\mu_I$, and at zero temperature. We map out the phase diagram in the $\mu$-$\mu_I$ plane, which has four phases: a vacuum phase, a phase with condensed charged pions/Cooper pairs of $u$ and $\bar{d}$ quarks, a normal quark matter phase, and a color superconducting phase (2SC phase). %In the 2SC phase, we study the effects of imposing color and %electric charge neutrality. The global symmetry breaking $SU(3)_c\rightarrow SU(2)_c$ in the 2SC phase gives rise to a number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We classify them and briefly discuss their properties. We calculate the speed of sound $c_s$ in the two special cases, finite $\mu_I$ and $\mu=0$, and finite $\mu$ and $\mu_I=0$. In both cases, the speed of sound exhibits a maximum and approaches the conformal limit from above as the density increases. For non-zero isospin $\mu_I$, this behavior is in agreement with the speed of sound obtained from lattice simulations. In the 2SC phase, the behavior is qualitatively the same if we impose local charge neutrality. Finally, we discuss the possibility of having a mixed phase of negatively charged normal quark matter and positively charged 2SC matter with global color charge neutrality imposed on the latter.</description>

      <title>Spacetime curvature corrections for the Yukawa potential and its application for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spacetime curvature on the Yukawa potential, focusing on boson-boson interactions derived from the {\Phi^3} theory. Using the Bunch-Parker propagator expansion within Born's first approximation, we derive a Yukawa-like potential in a curved spacetime. We analyze the impact of the curvature on the propagator in momentum space, revealing modifications to the potential and showing that the corrections are determined by geometric quantities from Einstein's equations, like the Ricci scalar and tensor. We illustrate this using the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, highlighting the corrections' magnitude for specific parameters. Our results underscore the nuanced interplay between spacetime curvature and quantum interactions, providing insights into nucleon-nucleon systems in curved spacetimes or near strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating nucleon-nucleon correlations inherent to the strong nuclear force is one of the core goals in nuclear physics research. We showcase the unique opportunities offered by collisions of $^{16}$O nuclei at high-energy facilities to reveal detailed many-body properties of the nuclear ground state. We interface existing knowledge about the geometry of $^{16}$O coming from \textit{ab-initio} calculations of nuclear structure with transport simulations of high-energy $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions. Bulk observables in these processes, such as the elliptic flow or the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, are found to depend significantly on the input nuclear model and to be sensitive to realistic clustering and short-range repulsive correlations, effectively opening a new avenue to probe these features experimentally. This finding demonstrates collisions of oxygen nuclei as a tool to elucidate initial conditions of small collision systems while fostering connections with effective field theories of nuclei rooted in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Influence of effective nucleon mass on equation of state for supernova simulations and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the effective nucleon mass on the equation of state (EOS), which is constructed for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) framework. The study introduces a new RMF parameter set, TM1m, which is a modification of the TM1e model with an adjusted effective mass, maintaining the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The TM1m model, with a larger effective mass ratio ($M^{\ast}/M \sim 0.8$) compared to the TM1e model ($M^{\ast}/M \sim 0.63$), is employed to construct a new EOS table, EOS5. This EOS table is designed to offer insights into the influence of the effective nucleon mass on the EOS within a relativistic framework, particularly above the saturation density. The results of EOS5 are compared with those obtained from other models, including both relativistic and nonrelativistic approaches. The properties of cold neutron stars, calculated using the TM1m model, are compatible with the existence of a $2\ M_\odot$ pulsar and the latest constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of a canonical $1.4\ M_\odot$ neutron star, derived from astrophysical observations.</description>

Abstract: Multimessenger signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are promising tools to infer the largely unknown properties of nuclear matter at densities that are presently inaccessible to laboratory experiments. The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by BNS merger remnants, in particular, have the potential of setting tight constraints on the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) that would complement those coming from the late inspiral, direct mass-radius measurements, or ab-initio dense-matter calculations. To explore this possibility, we perform a representative series of general-relativistic simulations of BNS systems with EOSs carefully constructed so as to cover comprehensively the high-density regime of the EOS space. From these simulations, we identify a novel and tight correlation between the ratio of the energy and angular-momentum losses in the late-time portion of the post-merger signal, i.e., the ``long ringdown'', and the properties of the EOS at the highest pressures and densities in neutron-star cores. When applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals, we find a significant reduction of the EOS uncertainty at densities several times the nuclear saturation density, where no direct constraints are currently available. Hence, the long ringdown has the potential of providing new and stringent constraints on the state of matter in neutron stars in general and, in particular, in their cores.</description>

      <title>Vortical waves in a quantum fluid with vector, axial, and helical charges. I. Non-dissipative transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the spin-orbit coupling, Dirac fermions, submerged in a thermal bath with finite macroscopic vorticity, exhibit a spin polarisation along the direction parallel to the vorticity vector $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$. Due to the symmetries of the Lagrangian for free massless Dirac particles, there are three independent and classically conserved currents corresponding to the vector, axial, and helical charges. The constitutive relations for the charge currents and the stress-energy tensor at thermal equilibrium, derived in the framework of quantum field theory at finite temperature, reveal vorticity-induced contributions that deviate from the perfect fluid form. In this paper, we consider the mode structure of the corresponding hydrodynamical theory and derive collective excitations associated with coherent fluctuations of all three charges. We show that the chirally imbalanced rotating fluid should possess non-reciprocal gapless waves that propagate with different velocities along and opposite to the vorticity vector. We also uncover a strictly unidirectional mode, which we call the Axial Vortical Wave, propagating in the background of the axial charge density. The emergence of this wave can be traced back to earlier studies of vortical chiral fluids in a hydrodynamic approach. We also point out an unexpected instability in the limit of degenerate matter and discuss possible solutions when helicity and axial charge non-conservation are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Vortical waves in a quantum fluid with vector, axial and helical charges. II. Dissipative effects</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the effect of interactions on the local, average polarization of a quantum plasma of massless fermion particles characterized by vector, axial, and helical quantum numbers. Due to the helical and axial vortical effects, perturbations in the vector charge in a rotating plasma can lead to chiral and helical charge transfer along the direction of the vorticity vector. At the same time, interactions between the plasma constituents lead to the dissipation of the helical charge through helicity-violating pair annihilation (HVPA) processes and of the axial charge through the axial anomaly. We will discuss separately a QED-like plasma, in which we ignore background electromagnetic fields and thus the axial charge is approximately conserved, as well as a QCD-like plasma, where instanton effects lead to the violation of the axial charge conservation, even in the absence of background chromomagnetic fields. The non-conservation of helicity and chirality leads to a gapping of the Helical, Axial, and mixed Axial-Helical vortical waves that prevents their infrared modes from propagating. On the other hand, usual dissipative effects, such as charge diffusion, lead to significant damping of ultraviolet modes. We end this paper with a discussion of the regimes where these vortical waves may propagate.</description>

      <title>Lighting up the Photon Wigner Distribution via Dilepton Productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of lepton pair production through photon-photon fusion processes in heavy-ion collisions. It is demonstrated that the dilepton production at a given impact parameter ($b_\perp$) with a fixed transverse momentum imbalance ($q_\perp$) can be factorized into a unified formula in terms of the Wigner photon distribution of heavy nuclei. We show that this framework provides a comprehensive description of all the relevant data from RHIC to the LHC, with a strong evidence that the quasi-real photon can be radiated not only from the nucleus as a whole, standing for the coherent contribution, but also from the sub-structures inside the nucleus, representing the incoherent contribution. Further predictions are made for the anisotropies in the correlations between $q_\perp$, $b_\perp$, and the dilepton transverse momentum ($P_\perp$). This will help us to constrain the photon Wigner distribution which plays a crucial role to study the gluonic matter of nucleus at small-$x$ through the diffractive photoproduction processes in heavy ion collision.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of splitting of the chiral and deconfinement transition due to rotation in QCD: the phase diagram of linear sigma model coupled to Polyakov loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of rigid rotation on the critical temperatures of deconfinement and chiral transitions in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and the Polyakov loop. We point out the essential role of the causality condition, which requires that any point of the system should rotate slower than the velocity of light. We show that imposing this physical requirement leads to inhibition of the splitting between the chiral and confining transitions, which becomes negligibly small ({\Delta}T ~ 1 MeV or less) for experimentally relevant, slow angular velocities {\Omega} ~ 10 MeV of a 5-10 fm-sized systems. Moreover, the boundedness of the system has a much bigger effect on temperature splitting than the rotation itself: the splitting reaches 10 MeV in a small, one-fermi-sized non-rotating system. The temperature splitting may, however, become enhanced in an academic limit of ultra-relativistic regimes when the boundary of the system rotates at near-to-light velocities.</description>

      <title>Transverse force distributions in the proton from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-spin asymmetries observed in polarised deep-inelastic scattering are important probes of hadron structure. The Sivers asymmetry has been the focus of much attention in QCD phenomenology and is yet to be understood at the quark level. In this Letter, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the spatial distribution of a colour-Lorentz force acting on the struck quark in a proton. We determine a spin-independent confining force, as well as spin-dependent force distributions with local forces on the order of 3 GeV/fm. These distributions offer a complementary picture of the Sivers asymmetry in transversely polarised deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Closures for Neutrino Moment Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A computationally efficient method for calculating the transport of neutrino flavor in simulations is to use angular moments of the neutrino one-body reduced density matrix, i.e., `quantum moments'. As with any moment-based radiation transport method, a closure is needed if the infinite tower of moment evolution equations is truncated. We derive a general parameterization of a quantum closure and the limits the parameters must satisfy in order for the closure to be physical. We then derive from multi-angle calculations the evolution of the closure parameters in two test cases which we then progressively insert into a moment evolution code and show how the parameters affect the moment results until the full multi-angle results are reproduced. This parameterization paves the way to setting prescriptions for genuine quantum closures adapted to neutrino transport in a range of situations.</description>
