      <title>Statistical trends in JWST transiting exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our brains are hardwired for pattern recognition as correlations are useful for predicting and understanding nature. As more exoplanet atmospheres are being characterized with JWST, we are starting to unveil their properties on a population level. Here we present a framework for comparing exoplanet transmission spectroscopy from 3 to 5$\mu$m with four bands: L (2.9 - 3.7$\mu$m), SO$_2$ (3.95 - 4.1$\mu$m), CO$_2$ (4.25 - 4.4$\mu$m) and CO (4.5 - 4.9$\mu$m). Together, the four bands cover the major carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur-bearing molecules including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, SO$_2$, CO$_2$, and CO. Among the eight high-precision gas giant exoplanet planet spectra we collected, we found strong correlations between the SO$_2$-L index and planet mass (r=-0.41$\pm$0.09) and temperature (r=-0.64$\pm$0.08), indicating SO$_2$ preferably exists (SO$_2$-L$&gt;$-0.5) among low mass ($\sim&lt;$0.3M$_J$) and cooler ($\sim&lt;$1200K) targets. We also observe strong temperature dependency for both CO$_2$-L and CO-L indices. Under equilibrium chemistry and isothermal thermal structure assumptions, we find that the planet sample favors super-solar metallicity and low C/O ratio ($&lt;$0.7). In addition, the presence of a mass-metallicity correlation is favored over uniform metallicity with the eight planets. We further introduce the SO$_2$-L versus CO$_2$-L diagram alike the color-magnitude diagram for stars and brown dwarfs. All reported trends here will be testable and be further quantified with existing and future JWST observations within the next few years.</description>

      <title>Cross validation of albedo determination for 1627 Ivar from three different techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near Earth Asteroids are of great interest to the scientific community due to their proximity to Earth, making them both potential hazards and possible targets for future missions, as they are relatively easy to reach by spacecraft. A number of techniques and models can be used to constrain their physical parameters and build a comprehensive assessment of these objects. In this work, we compare physical property results obtained from improved $H_V$ absolute magnitude values, thermophysical modeling, and polarimetry data for the well-known Amor-class NEO 1627 Ivar. We show that our fits for albedo are consistent with each other, thus demonstrating the validity of this cross-referencing approach, and propose a value for Ivar's albedo of $0.24^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ . Future observations will extend this work to a larger sample size, increasing the reliability of polarimetry for rapid asteroid property characterization, as a technique independent of previously established methods and requiring significantly fewer observations.</description>

      <title>MOA-2022-BLG-033Lb, KMT-2023-BLG-0119Lb, and KMT-2023-BLG-1896Lb: Three low mass-ratio microlensing planets detected through dip signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the anomalies in the light curves of the lensing events MOA-2022-BLG-033, KMT-2023-BLG-0119, and KMT-2023-BLG-1896. We conducted detailed modeling of the light curves to uncover the nature of the anomalies. This modeling revealed that all signals originated from planetary companions to the primary lens. The planet-to-host mass ratios are very low: $q\sim 7.5\times 10^{-5}$ for MOA-2022-BLG-033, $q\sim 3.6\times 10^{-4}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-0119, and $q\sim 6.9\times 10^{-5}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-1896. The anomalies occurred as the source passed through the negative deviation region behind the central caustic along the planet-host axis. The solutions are subject to a common inner-outer degeneracy, resulting in variations in estimating the projected planet-host separation. For KMT-2023-BLG-1896, although the planetary scenario provides the best explanation of the anomaly, the binary companion scenario is marginally possible. We estimate the physical parameters of the planetary systems through Bayesian analyses based on the lensing observables. The analysis identifies MOA-2022-BLG-033L as a planetary system with an ice giant, approximately 12 times the mass of Earth, orbiting an early M dwarf star. The companion of KMT-2023-BLG-1896L is also an ice giant, with a mass around 16 Earth masses, orbiting a mid-K-type main-sequence star. The companion of KMT-2023-BLG-0119L, which has a mass about the mass of Saturn, orbits a mid-K-type dwarf star. The lens for MOA-2022-BLG-033 is highly likely to be located in the disk, whereas for the other events, the probabilities of the lens being in the disk or the bulge are roughly comparable.</description>

      <title>Planetary Edge Trends (PET). I. The Inner Edge-Stellar Mass Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The position of the innermost planet (i.e., the inner edge) in a planetary system provides important information about the relationship of the entire system to its host star properties, offering potentially valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution processes. In this work, based on the Kepler Data Release 25 (DR25) catalog combined with LAMOST and Gaia data, we investigate the correlation between stellar mass and the inner edge position across different populations of small planets in multi-planetary systems, such as super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. By correcting for the influence of stellar metallicity and analyzing the impact of observational selection effects, we confirm the trend that as stellar mass increases, the position of the inner edge shifts outward. Our results reveal a stronger correlation between the inner edge and stellar mass with a power-law index of 0.6-1.1, which is larger compared to previous studies. The stronger correlation in our findings is primarily attributed to two factors: first, the metallicity correction applied in this work enhances the correlation; second, the previous use of occurrence rates to trace the inner edge weakens the observed correlation. Through comparison between observed statistical results and current theoretical models, we find that the pre-main-sequence (PMS) dust sublimation radius of the protoplanetary disk best matches the observed inner edge stellar mass. Therefore, we conclude that the inner dust disk likely limits the innermost orbits of small planets, contrasting with the inner edges of hot Jupiters, which are associated with the magnetospheres of gas disks, as suggested by previous studies. This highlights that the inner edges of different planetary populations are likely regulated by distinct mechanisms.</description>

      <title>TOI-6038 A b: A dense sub-Saturn in the transition regime between the Neptunian ridge and savanna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and characterization of a sub-Saturn exoplanet, TOI-6038~A~b, using the PARAS-2 spectrograph. The planet orbits a bright ($m_V=9.9$), metal-rich late F-type star, TOI-6038~A, with $T_{\rm{eff}}=6110\pm100~\mathrm{K}$, $\log{g}=4.118^{+0.015}_{-0.025}$, and $[{\rm{Fe/H}}]=0.124^{+0.079}_{-0.077}$ dex. The system also contains a wide-orbit binary companion, TOI-6038~B, an early K-type star at a projected separation of $\approx3217$ AU. We combined radial velocity data from PARAS-2 with photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for joint modeling. TOI-6038~A~b has a mass of $78.5^{+9.5}_{-9.9}~M_\oplus$ and a radius of $6.41^{+0.20}_{-0.16}~R_\oplus$, orbiting in a circular orbit with a period of $5.8267311^{+0.0000074}_{-0.0000068}$ days. Internal structure modeling suggests that $\approx74\%$ of the planet's mass is composed of dense materials, such as rock and iron, forming a core, while the remaining mass consists of a low-density H/He envelope. TOI-6038~A~b lies at the transition regime between the recently identified Neptunian ridge and savanna. Having a density of $\rho_{\rm{P}}=1.62^{+0.23}_{-0.24}\rm~g\,cm^{-3}$, TOI-6038~A~b is compatible with the population of dense ridge planets ($\rho_{\rm{P}}\simeq$ 1.5-2.0 $\rm~g\,cm^{-3}$), which have been proposed to have reached their close-in locations through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HEM). First-order estimates suggest that the secular perturbations induced by TOI-6038~B may be insufficient to drive the HEM of TOI-6038~A~b. Therefore, it is not clear whether HEM driven by a still undetected companion, or early disk-driven migration, brought TOI-6038~A~b to its present-day close-in orbit. Its bright host star makes TOI-6038~A~b a prime target for atmospheric escape and orbital architecture observations, which will help us to better understand its overall evolution.</description>

      <title>Continuous Fragmentation of Comet 157P/Tritton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the split comet 157P/Tritton in October - November 2022 and January 2024 with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). Our observations show that the splitting continued during the entire observing campaign. Fragmentation was associated with outbursts, consistent with the action of outgassing torques that spun up the nucleus and its fragments to the point of rotational instability. The outburst-fragmentation events can lead to a runaway process where the increasing spin rate, driven by outgassing torques, results in repeated mass loss, until the sublimating body completely disintegrates.</description>

      <title>The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin-orbit misalignment, and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering, the Lidov-Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin-orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies' spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>High-temperature measurements of acetylene VUV absorption cross sections and application to warm exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most observed exoplanets have high equilibrium temperatures. Understanding the chemistry of their atmospheres and interpreting their observations requires the use of chemical kinetic models including photochemistry. The thermal dependence of the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) absorption cross sections of molecules used in these models is poorly known at high temperatures, leading to uncertainties in the resulting abundance profiles. The aim of our work is to study experimentally the thermal dependence of VUV absorption cross sections of molecules of interest for exoplanet atmospheres and provide accurate data for use in atmospheric models. This study focuses on acetylene (C2H2). We measured absorption cross sections of C2H2 at seven temperatures ranging from 296 to 773 K recorded in the 115-230 nm spectral domain using VUV spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation. These data were used in our 1D thermo-photochemical model, to assess their impact on the predicted composition of a generic hot Jupiter-like exoplanet atmosphere. The absolute absorption cross sections of C2H2 increase with temperature. This increase is relatively constant from 115 to 185 nm and rises sharply from 185 to 230 nm. The abundance profile of C2H2 calculated using the model shows a slight variation, with a maximum decrease of 40% near 5 x 10-5 bar, when using C2H2 absorption cross sections measured at 773 K compared to those at 296 K. This is explained by the absorption, higher in the atmosphere, of the actinic flux from 150 to 230 nm due to the increase in the C2H2 absorption in this spectral range. This change also impacts the abundance profiles of other by-products such as methane (CH4) and ethylene (C2H4). We present the first experimental measurements of the VUV absorption cross sections of C2H2 at high temperatures. Similar studies of other major species are needed to improve our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>An Independent Search for Small Long-period Planets in Kepler Data I: Detection Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented photometric precision of Kepler mission allows searching for Earth-like planets. However, the current Kepler catalog exhibits insufficient reliability for long-period low signal-to-noise planets due to systematic false alarms caused by correlated and non-Gaussian noise. As a result, it remains hard to measure the occurrence rate of such planets.
  We aim to obtain a more reliable catalog of small (Kepler MES$\lesssim$12) long-period (50-500 days) planet candidates from Kepler data and use it to improve the occurrence rate estimate. This work develops an independent search pipeline that takes into account noise non-Gaussianity and physical prior. It provides a tail-less background distribution with a rate of $\sim$1 false alarm per search for MES$\sim$7.8. We demonstrate the increase in detection efficiency for MES of 7.5-9 and $&gt;$4 transits due to the background distribution control.
  We conducted a search on the entirety of Kepler data, applying permutation and injection procedures to calculate the probability of planetary origin for every candidate. The pipeline detected $\sim50$ candidate events with a high probability of originating from real planets, which will be presented in our future work.</description>

      <title>Production of linear alkanes via the solid-state hydrogenation of interstellar polyynes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly unsaturated carbon chains, including polyynes, have been detected in many astronomical regions and planetary systems. With the success of the QUIJOTE survey of the TMC-1, the community has seen a "boom" in the number of detected carbon chains. On the other hand, the Rosetta mission revealed the release of fully saturated hydrocarbons, C$_3$H$_8$, C$_4$H$_{10}$, C$_5$H$_{12}$, and (under specific conditions) C$_6$H$_{14}$ with C$_7$H$_{16}$, from the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The detection of the latter two is attributed to dust-rich events. Similarly, the analysis of samples returned from asteroid Ryugu by Hayabusa2 mission indicates the presence of long saturated aliphatic chains in Ryugu's organic matter. The surface chemistry of unsaturated carbon chains under conditions resembling those of molecular clouds can provide a possible link among these independent observations. However, laboratory-based investigations to validate such a chemistry is still lacking. In the present study, we aim to experimentally verify the formation of fully saturated hydrocarbons by the surface hydrogenation of C$_{2n}$H$_2$ ($n&gt;1$) polyynes under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 10 K. We undertook a two-step experimental technique. First, a thin layer of C$_2$H$_2$ ice was irradiated by UV-photons ($\geq$ 121 nm) to achieve a partial conversion of C$_2$H$_2$ into larger polyynes: C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_2$. Afterwards, the obtained photoprocessed ice was exposed to H atoms to verify the formation of various saturated hydrocarbons. In addition to C$_2$H$_6$, which was investigated previously, the formation of larger alkanes, including C$_4$H$_{10}$ and (tentatively) C$_6$H$_{14}$, is confirmed by our study. A qualitative analysis of the obtained kinetic data indicates that hydrogenation of HCCH and HCCCCH triple bonds proceeds at comparable rates, given a surface temperature of 10 K.}</description>

      <title>Electrostatic instability of non-spherical dust in sub-stellar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged dust clouds play an important role in the evolution of sub-stellar atmospheres through electrical discharges such as lightning events or inter-grain discharges. The consequent plasma activation presents an alternative source of disequilibrium chemistry, potentially triggering a set of chemical reactions otherwise energetically unavailable. The aim of this paper is to address the problem of the electrostatic stability of charged spheroidal dust grains in sub-stellar clouds and its impact on inter-grain electrostatic discharges, the available area for atmospheric gas-phase surface chemistry, the particle eccentricity distribution function and observed polarization signatures. This paper has derived the criterion for the allowed values of dust eccentricity that are electrostatically stable as a function of grain size $a\in[0.2,1.8]~\mu$m, floating potential $\phi_{f}\in[1, 10]$~V and tensile strength $\Sigma_{s}=10^{3}$~Pa. As a consequence of electrostatic instability we also calculate the expected electric field enhancement at the spheroidal poles, the increased surface area of a dust grain, the truncation of the particle eccentricity distribution function and the resultant degree of polarization. Dust grains with an eccentricity below a critical value will be electrostatically stable; whereas, grains with an eccentricity above a critical value will be unstable. The results presented here are applicable not only to spheroidal dust grains but any non-spherical dust grains where non-uniform surface electric fields or inhomogeneous tensile strengths could be susceptible to electrostatic instability. In this context electrostatic erosion presents a mechanism that may produce bumpy, irregularly shaped or porous grains.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Electromagnetic Radiation with Cometary Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chapter overviews the recent developments in the remote sensing of cometary dust using visible, near-infrared, and thermal-infrared radiation, as well as interaction of the dust with electromagnetic radiation, which affects the dynamics of dust particles. It considers photometric, polarimetric, and spectral studies of cometary dust, focusing on those observables and correlations between them that allow revealing the composition, size, and structure of the dust particles. The analysis includes the observed brightness and polarization phase curves, color and polarimetric color of the cometary dust, and near- and thermal-infrared spectra. Special attention is paid to the role of gas contamination in the polarimetric and photometric data. A review of modeling efforts to interpret the observational results is also provided, describing the most popular (and some novel) techniques used in the computer modeling of light scattering by dust particles with a focus on modeling the most complex type of cometary particles: fluffy and porous agglomerates. The chapter also considers how properties of the dust particles affect their photoelectric emission and their response to the radiation pressure and radiative torque, including alignment and fragmentation of particles. Results of computer and some laboratory modeling are analyzed for their consistency with the observational and in situ data. Also discussed is how the modeling results can be combined with in situ data for better characterization of the cometary dust.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Beta Pictoris planetary system and possibility of an additional planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Beta Pictoris system is characterized by a dusty debris disk, in addition to the presence of two already known planets. This makes it a particularly interesting case for studying the formation and evolution of planetary systems at a stage where giant planets have already formed, most of the protoplanetary gas has dissipated, and terrestrial planets could emerge. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of additional planets orbiting beyond the outermost known one, $\beta$ Pic b. More specifically, we aim to assess whether additional planets in the system could explain the discrepancy between the predicted cutoff of the disk inner cavity at $\sim$28 au with only two planets, and the observed one at $\sim$50 au. We perform an exhaustive dynamical modeling of the debris disk and the carving of its inner edge, by introducing one or two additional planets beyond $\beta$ Pic b, coplanar with the disk. Guided by theoretical predictions for the parameter space - mass, semi-major axis, eccentricity - allowed for additional planets, we further carry out a set of N-body simulations, using the symplectic integrator RMVS3. Our simulations indicate that an additional planet with a low eccentricity of 0.05, a mass between 0.15 and 1 $M_{Jup}$, and a semi-major axis between 30 and 36 au, would be consistent with the observations of an inner debris disk edge at 50 au. We have also explored the hypotheses of a higher eccentricity and the presence of two additional lower mass planets instead of one, which could also account for these observations. While we have found that one or even two additional planets could explain the observed location of the disk inner edge, these hypothetical planets remain in most cases below the current observational limits of high contrast imaging. Future observational campaigns with improved sensitivity will help lowering these limits and perhaps detect that planet.</description>

      <title>Superhabitable Planets Around Mid-Type K Dwarf Stars Enhance Simulated JWST Observability and Surface Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our search for life beyond the Solar System, certain planetary bodies may be more conducive to life than Earth. However, the observability of these `superhabitable' planets in the habitable zones around K dwarf stars has not been fully modeled. This study addresses this gap by modeling the atmospheres of superhabitable exoplanets. We employed the 1D model $\texttt{Atmos}$ to define the superhabitable parameter space, $\texttt{POSEIDON}$ to calculate synthetic transmission spectra, and $\texttt{PandExo}$ to simulate $\text{JWST}$ observations. Our results indicate that planets orbiting mid-type K dwarfs, receiving $80\%$ of Earth's solar flux, are optimal for life. These planets sustain temperate surfaces with moderate $CO_2$ levels, unlike those receiving $60\%$ flux, where necessarily higher $CO_2$ levels could hinder biosphere development. Moreover, they are easier to observe, requiring significantly fewer transits for biosignature detection compared to Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. For instance, detecting biosignature pairs like oxygen and methane from $30$ parsecs would require $150$ transits ($43$ years) for a superhabitable planet, versus over $1700$ transits ($\sim 1700$ years) for Earth-like planets. While such observation times lie outside of $\text{JWST}$ mission timescales, our study underscores the necessity of next-generation telescopes and provides valuable targets for future observations with, for example, the $\text{ELT}$.</description>

      <title>Sporadic Dips from Extended Debris Transiting the Metal-Rich White Dwarf SBSS 1232+563</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of deep but sporadic transits in the flux of SBSS 1232+563, a metal-rich white dwarf polluted by disrupted exoplanetary debris. Nearly 25 years of photometry from multiple sky surveys reveal evidence of occasional dimming of the white dwarf, most notably evident in an 8-months-long event in 2023 that caused a &gt;40% drop in flux from the star. In-transit follow-up shows additional short-timescale (minutes- to hours-long) dimming events. TESS photometry suggests a coherent 14.842-hr signal that could represent the dominant orbital period of debris. Six low-resolution spectra collected at various transit depths over two decades show no evidence of significant changes in the observed elemental abundances. SBSS 1232+563 demonstrates that debris transits around white dwarfs can be sporadic, with many years of inactivity before large-amplitude dimming events.</description>

      <title>Distributions of wide binary stars in theory and in Gaia data: I. Generalized Ambartsumian (1937) approach and the family of power-law distributions of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital parameter space of wide, weakly bound binary stars has been shaped by the still poorly known circumstances of their formation, as well as by subsequent dynamical evolution in parent clusters and in the field. The advance of the Gaia mission astrometry takes statistical studies of wide stellar systems to an unprecedented level of precision and scope. On the theoretical side of the problem, the old approach proposed by Jeans and developed by Ambartsumian is revisited here. It is shown how certain simplifying assumptions about the phase density of binary systems in the framework of general copula distributions can lead to a family of analytical representations for the marginal distribution of orbital eccentricity, including accommodating and flexible power-law models. We further demonstrate the application of these models in forward Monte Carlo simulations of the measured motion angles between the relative velocity and separation vectors on the example of 170K listed Gaia binary systems, providing inference in the intrinsic distribution of orbital eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Solar variability in the Mg II h and k lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar irradiance and its variations in the ultraviolet (UV) control the photochemistry in Earth's atmosphere and influence Earth's climate. The variability of Mg II h and k core-to-wing ratio, also known as the Mg II index, is highly correlated with the solar UV irradiance variability. Because of this, Mg II index is routinely used as a proxy for solar UV irradiance variability, which can help to get insights into the influence of solar UV irradiance variability on Earth's climate. Measurements of the Mg II index, however, have only been carried out since 1978 and do not cover the climate relevant timescales longer than a few decades. Here we present a model to calculate the Mg II index and its variability based on the well-established SATIRE (Spectral And Total Irradiance REconstruction) model. We demonstrate that our model calculations yield an excellent agreement with the observed Mg II index variations, both on the solar activity cycle and on the solar rotation timescales. Using this model, we synthesize Mg II index timeseries on climate relevant timescales of decades and longer. Here we present the timeseries of the Mg II index spanning nearly three centuries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field strength, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence and with matching temporal characteristics. During geospace storms, then, turbulent structuring as well as fast electrodynamics in the dayside polar ionosphere can be driven by wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>The transmission spectrum of the potentially rocky planet L 98-59 c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of the 1.35+/-0.07 Earth-radius planet L 98-59 c, collected using Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope. L 98-59 is a nearby (10.6 pc), bright (H=7.4 mag), M3V star that harbors three small, transiting planets. As one of the closest known transiting multi-planet systems, L 98-59 offers one of the best opportunities to probe and compare the atmospheres of rocky planets that formed in the same stellar environment. We measured the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 c and the extracted spectrum showed marginal evidence (2.1{\sigma}) for wavelength-dependent transit depth variations that could indicate the presence of an atmosphere. We forward-modeled possible atmospheric compositions of the planet based on the transmission spectrum. Although L 98-59 was previously thought to be a fairly quiet star, we have seen evidence for stellar activity, and therefore we assessed a scenario where the source of the signal originates with inhomogeneities on stellar surface. We also see a correlation between transits of L 98-59 c and L 98-59 b collected 12.5 hours apart, which is suggestive (but at &lt;2{\sigma} confidence) of a contaminating component from the star impacting the exoplanet spectrum. While intriguing, our results are inconclusive and additional data is needed to verify any atmospheric signal. Fortunately, additional data has been collected from both HST and JWST. Should this result be confirmed with additional data, L 98-59 c would be the first planet smaller than two Earth-radii with a detected atmosphere.</description>

      <title>MINDS: JWST/NIRCam imaging of the protoplanetary disk PDS 70</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Two protoplanets have recently been discovered within the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk. JWST/NIRCam offers a unique opportunity to characterize them and their birth environment at wavelengths difficult to access from the ground. Aims. We aim to image the circumstellar environment of PDS 70 at 1.87 $\mu$m and 4.83 $\mu$m, assess the presence of Pa-$\alpha$ emission due to accretion onto the protoplanets, and probe any IR excess indicative of heated circumplanetary material. Methods. We obtain non-coronagraphic JWST/NIRCam images of PDS 70 within the MINDS (MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey) program. We leverage the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package for data reduction, and develop dedicated routines for optimal stellar PSF subtraction, unbiased imaging of the disk, and protoplanet flux measurement in this type of dataset. A radiative transfer model of the disk is used to disentangle the contributions from the disk and the protoplanets. Results. We re-detect both protoplanets and identify extended emission after subtracting a disk model, including a large-scale spiral-like feature. We interpret its signal in the direct vicinity of planet c as tracing the accretion stream feeding its circumplanetary disk, while the outer part of the feature may rather reflect asymmetric illumination of the outer disk. We also report a bright signal consistent with a previously proposed protoplanet candidate enshrouded in dust, near the 1:2:4 mean-motion resonance with planets b and c. The 1.87 $\mu$m flux of planet b is consistent with atmospheric model predictions, but not that of planet c. We discuss potential origins for this discrepancy, including significant Pa-$\alpha$ line emission. The 4.83 $\mu$m fluxes of planets b and c suggest enshrouding dust or heated CO emission from their circumplanetary environment.</description>

      <title>Peering into the black box: forward-modeling the uncertainty budget of high-resolution spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS; R &gt;~ 15,000) is a powerful complement to space-based studies of exoplanet atmospheres. By resolving individual spectral lines, HRCCS can precisely measure chemical abundance ratios, directly constrain atmospheric dynamics, and robustly probe multidimensional physics. But the subtleties of HRCCS datasets -- e.g., the lack of exoplanetary spectra visible by eye and the statistically complex process of telluric removal -- can make interpreting them difficult. In this work, we seek to clarify the uncertainty budget of HRCCS with a forward-modeling approach. We present a HRCCS observation simulator, scope (https://github.com/arjunsavel/scope), that incorporates spectral contributions from the exoplanet, star, tellurics, and instrument. This tool allows us to control the underlying dataset, enabling controlled experimentation with complex HRCCS methods. Simulating a fiducial hot Jupiter dataset (WASP-77Ab emission with IGRINS), we first confirm via multiple tests that the commonly used principal components analysis does not bias the planetary signal when few components are used. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mildly varying tellurics and moderate wavelength solution errors induce only mild decreases in HRCCS detection significance. However, limiting-case, strongly varying tellurics can bias the retrieved velocities and gas abundances. Additionally, in the low-SNR limit, constraints on gas abundances become highly non-Gaussian. Our investigation of the uncertainties and potential biases inherent in HRCCS data analysis enables greater confidence in scientific results from this maturing method.</description>

      <title>The First Spin-Orbit Obliquity of an M dwarf/brown dwarf System: An eccentric and aligned TOI-2119 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first instance of an M dwarf/brown dwarf obliquity measurement for the TOI-2119 system using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. TOI-2119 b is a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a young, active early M dwarf ($T_{\rm{eff}}$ = 3553 K). It has a mass of 64.4 M$_{\rm{J}}$ and radius of 1.08 R$_{\rm{J}}$, with an eccentric orbit ($e$ = 0.3) at a period of 7.2 days. For this analysis, we utilise NEID spectroscopic transit observations and ground based simultaneous transit photometry from the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) and the Las Campanas Remote Observatory (LCRO). We fit all available data of TOI-2119 b to refine the brown dwarf parameters and update the ephemeris. The classical Rossiter-McLaughlin technique yields a projected star-planet obliquity of $\lambda=-0.8\pm1.1^\circ$ and a three-dimensional obliquity of $\psi=15.7\pm5.5^\circ$. Additionally, we spatially resolve the stellar surface of TOI-2119 utilising the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to determine the projected star-planet obliquity as $\lambda=1.26 \pm 1.3^{\circ}$. Both of these results agree within $2\sigma$ and confirm the system is aligned, where TOI-2119 b joins an emerging group of aligned brown dwarf obliquities. We also probe stellar surface activity on the surface of TOI-2119 in the form of centre-to-limb variations as well as the potential for differential rotation. Overall, we find tentative evidence for centre-to-limb variations on the star but do not detect evidence of differential rotation.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter we attempt to distill the very large number of possible future inquiries of Titan into a relatively concise list of twenty high level questions - each of which of would necessarily entail a multitude of more specific investigations and studies. While this list does not encompass all possible open questions, and is divided into topics according to our preference and not in any way uniquely, we believe that it does however span a wide range of the most intriguing topics about Titan, and may form some sort of guide especially for those embarking into Titan studies for the first time. At the end of this chapter we return to explore how these four techniques may be used to answer the large, high-level open questions in Titan science.</description>

      <title>Mysterious anomalies in Earth's atmosphere and strongly interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04635</link>

Abstract: It has been recently argued in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} that numerous enigmatic observations remain challenging to explain within the framework of conventional physics. These anomalies include unexpected correlations between temperature variations in the stratosphere, the total electron content of the Earth's atmosphere, and earthquake activity on one hand, and the positions of planets on the other. Decades of collected data provide statistically significant evidence for these observed correlations. The work in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} suggests that these correlations arise from strongly interacting ``streaming invisible matter'' which gets gravitationally focused by the solar system bodies including the Earth's inner mass distribution. Here, we propose that some of these, as well as other anomalies, may be explained by rare yet energetic events involving the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQNs) impacting the Earth. In other words, we identify the ``streaming invisible matter'' conjectured in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} with AQNs, offering a concrete microscopic mechanism to elucidate the observed correlations. It is important to note that the AQN model was originally developed to address the observed similarity between the dark matter and visible matter densities in the Universe \cite{Zhitnitsky:2002qa, Zhitnitsky:2021iwg}, i.e., $\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ and not explain the anomalies discussed here. Nonetheless, we support our proposal by demonstrating that the intensity and spectral characteristics of AQN-induced events are consistent with the aforementioned puzzling observations.</description>

      <title>Redshifting the Study of Cold Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets: the Mid-Infrared Wavelength Region as an Indicator of Surface Gravity and Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST is opening many avenues for exploration. For cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets, JWST has opened the door to the mid-infrared wavelength region, where such objects emit significant energy. For the first time, astronomers have access to mid-infrared spectroscopy for objects colder than 600 K. The first spectra appear to validate the model suite known as ATMO 2020++: atmospheres which include disequilibrium chemistry and have a non-adiabatic pressure-temperature relationship. Preliminary fits to JWST spectroscopy of Y dwarfs show that the slope of the energy distribution from lambda = 4.5 um to lambda = 10 um is very sensitive to gravity. We explore this phenomenon using PH3-free ATMO 2020++ models and updated WISE W2 - W3 colors. We find that an absolute 4.5 um flux measurement constrains temperature, and the ratio of the 4.5 um flux to the 10 - 15 um flux is sensitive to gravity and less sensitive to metallicity. We identify 10 T dwarfs with red W2 - W3 colors which are likely to be very low gravity, young, few-Jupiter-mass objects; one of these is the previously known COCONUTS-2b. The unusual Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 is blue in W2 - W3 and we find that the 4 to 18 um JWST spectrum is well reproduced if the system is a pair of high gravity 400 K dwarfs. Recently published JWST colors and luminosity-based effective temperatures for late-T and Y dwarfs further corroborate the ATMO 2020++ models, demonstrating the potential for significant improvement in our understanding of cold very low-mass bodies in the solar neighborhood.</description>
