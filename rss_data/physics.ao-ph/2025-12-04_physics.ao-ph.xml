      <title>Harmonic Extension for Multiscale Analysis and Modeling Near Boundaries, with an Ocean Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treatment of fields near domain boundaries is a long-standing problem in signal processing that has come into renewed focus following recent efforts in convolution-based multiscale coarse-graining and in machine-learned parameterizations due to ocean boundary artifacts. Here, we propose a general method for extending fields beyond the domain boundaries by solving a Laplace boundary-value problem. Construction of the harmonic extension is well-posed, including uniqueness, and is consistent with the boundary conditions by design. The formulation applies to irregular boundaries such as discretized coastlines. The harmonic extension is physically desirable since it has minimum spatial variability among all admissible extensions satisfying the boundary conditions. The method is simple to implement using well-established numerical approaches, and is broadly applicable to extending oceanic variables over land boundaries. Other applications include machine learning parametrization and subgrid modeling of wall-bounded flows and multiphase flows. We demonstrate the method by extending sea-surface temperature (SST) over land using fixed temperature (Dirichlet) and no-flux (Neumann) boundary conditions: the land-filled solution is smooth with SST values between the coastal minimum and maximum.</description>

      <title>The Iris Illusion in the Tropical Sky Seen Through Two Decades of Aura MLS Ice Water Contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I analyzed ice water content (IWC) data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and sea surface temperature (SST) data from NOAA's Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) product from 2004 to 2024. Using these data, I derived monthly infrared (IR) leakage over the tropics and computed derivatives of both the IR leakage and tropical SST time series from 2005 to 2023. These two derivatives produced a Pearson correlation of -0.49, indicating that IR leakage decreases when SST increases. This behavior contradicts the trend predicted by the Iris hypothesis, suggesting that tropical cirrus clouds strengthen, rather than weaken, as the ocean warms.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Geophysical Predictions under Constrained Probabilistic Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has shown significant promise in studying complex geophysical dynamical systems, including turbulence and climate processes. Such systems often display sensitive dependence on initial conditions, reflected in positive Lyapunov exponents, where even small perturbations in short-term forecasts can lead to large deviations in long-term outcomes. Thus, meaningful inference requires not only accurate short-term predictions, but also consistency with the system's long-term attractor that is captured by the marginal distribution of state variables. Existing approaches attempt to address this challenge by incorporating spatial and temporal dependence, but these strategies become impractical when data are extremely sparse. In this work, we show that prior knowledge of marginal distributions offers valuable complementary information to short-term observations, motivating a distribution-informed learning framework. We introduce a calibration algorithm based on normalization and the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD) to enhance ML predictions. The method here employs KSD within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to calibrate model outputs, improving their fidelity to known physical distributions. This not only sharpens pointwise predictions but also enforces consistency with non-local statistical structures rooted in physical principles. Through synthetic experiments-spanning offline climatological CO2 fluxes and online quasi-geostrophic flow simulations-we demonstrate the robustness and broad utility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>An infrasound source analysis of the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule hypersonic re-entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule hypersonic re-entry into the atmosphere is a rare opportunity to test a variety of sonic boom source models since the projectile dimensions are well characterized. While the as-flown flight path is unknown, the predicted flight path enables a rough approximation of the source Mach number and location. Six infrasound microphones deployed in the boom carpet along the predicted flight path recorded impulsive signals from the OSIRIS-REx re-entry. Using a suite of atmosphere profiles and the geometric acoustics approximation, we estimate locations with uncertainty estimates along the flight path from which the signals were emitted. Acoustic overpressure and signal duration predictions from Whitham's far field theory, Carlson's simplified sonic boom prediction method, and a drag-dominated hypersonic model are analyzed with uncertainty estimates from the location estimate. While the Carlson simplified sonic boom prediction method could be accurate, our preference is for the drag-dominated source model. Using this source model with an inviscid Burgers' equation solver for propagation, we obtained an excellent match to the recorded data. These results will help better inform future sample return capsule re-entry observation campaigns as well as contribute to a better understanding of high altitude infrasonic sources.</description>

      <title>Isolating Balanced Ocean Dynamics in SWOT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission provides two-dimensional sea surface height (SSH) maps at unprecedented resolution, but its signal is a combination of balanced meso- and submesoscale turbulence, unbalanced internal waves, and small-scale noise. Interpreting the meso- and submesoscale flow features captured by SWOT requires a careful isolation of the balanced signal. We present a statistical method to do so in regions where internal-wave signals are negligible, such as western boundary current regions and the Southern Ocean. Our method assumes Gaussian statistics for both the balanced flow and the noise, which we infer by fitting parametric models to the observed SSH wavenumber spectrum. Using these inferred parameters, we perform a Bayesian inversion to reconstruct swath-aligned SSH maps that fill the nadir gap. We evaluate the method using synthetic data from a high-resolution simulation with realistic SWOT-like noise added. Comparisons with the underlying model data show that our reconstruction successfully removes small-scale noise while preserving meso- and submesoscale eddies, fronts, and filaments down to a feature scale of 10km. The comparison also demonstrates that the posterior uncertainty is a reliable estimate of the error.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetostrophic waves with magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03120v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfv\'en velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfv\'en waves. The timescales on which Alfv\'en waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfv\'en waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfv\'en waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</description>

Abstract: Despite the promising capability of multimodal foundation models, their application to the generation of meteorological products and services remains nascent. To accelerate aspiration and adoption, we explore the novel use of a vision language model for writing the iconic Shipping Forecast text directly from video-encoded gridded weather data. These early results demonstrate promising scalable technological opportunities for enhancing production efficiency and service innovation within the weather enterprise and beyond.</description>

      <title>Conditional updates of neural network weights for increased out of training performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a method to enhance neural network performance when training data and application data are not very similar, e.g., out of distribution problems, as well as pattern and regime shifts. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Retrain the neural network towards reasonable subsets of the training data set and note down the resulting weight anomalies. 2) Choose reasonable predictors and derive a regression between the predictors and the weight anomalies. 3) Extrapolate the weights, and thereby the neural network, to the application data. We show and discuss this method in three use cases from the climate sciences, which include successful temporal, spatial and cross-domain extrapolations of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Stratification, turbulence organization, and pressure-strain effects on surface-layer turbulence anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At large scales, the Reynolds stress tensor exhibits notable anisotropy, a key feature of all wall-bounded turbulent flows. Yet, how the drivers of this anisotropy evolve with shearing and thermal stratification in the atmospheric surface layer (ASL) remains a daunting challenge for theory and models alike. Here, the velocity variance budgets are used to explore the evolution of anisotropy in the daytime ASL close to the surface, region known to be problematic for large eddy simulations. A special focus is placed on the importance of slow and rapid pressure-strain correlations and the role of transport on partitioning the turbulent kinetic energy among the velocity components. Results obtained from near-surface observations of four datasets over flat and horizontally homogeneous terrain show persistent anisotropy over a wide range of flux Richardson numbers $R_{if}$ and wall-normal distances, and highlight the importance of different processes in three distinct flow regimes, roughly related to dynamic ($|R_{if}|\ll1$), dynamic-convective ($|R_{if}|\sim1$) and convective ($|R_{if}|\gg1$) regimes of the ASL. In particular, close to the surface in the dynamic-convective regime, a drop in wall-normal velocity variance and a substantial increase of spanwise velocity variance are shown to result from the increasing role of pressure transport and rapid distortion, related to turbulence organization. This behaviour is not captured by the classic Rotta closure but requires the inclusion of both rapid pressure-strain and transport terms. In all regimes wall blocking is found to influence turbulence close to the surface, thus requiring the adoption of an anisotropic Rotta model to accommodate its effects.</description>

      <title>Noctilucent Clouds Modulated by Strong 5-day Planetary Wave in 2025: Amplitudes, Phases and Altitudes Based on Ground-Based Observations and Satellite Temperature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the summer season of 2025, noctilucent clouds (NLC) were observed at the latitudes 55-60N from the late May until the late August. A distinct 5-day periodicity in their occurrence emerged following the summer solstice. Analysis of EOS Aura/MLS satellite data revealed that this effect was driven by a westward 5-day planetary wave, the amplitude of which was twice that of any previous northern summer since the start of the EOS Aura measurements in 2005. This study details the evolution of this exceptional planetary wave throughout the summer. Furthermore, NLC altitudes were determined via triangulation and colorimetry and were compared with MLS temperature profiles, enabling the determination of a mean positive phase lag for NLC occurrence relative to the temperature minimum.</description>

      <title>Integrating Weather Station Data and Radar for Precipitation Nowcasting: SmaAt-fUsion and SmaAt-Krige-GNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is essential for flood management, transportation, energy system operations, and emergency response. However, many existing models fail to fully exploit the extensive atmospheric information available, relying primarily on precipitation data alone. This study examines whether integrating multi-variable weather-station measurements with radar can enhance nowcasting skill and introduces two complementary architectures that integrate multi-variable station data with radar images. The SmaAt-fUsion model extends the SmaAt-UNet framework by incorporating weather station data through a convolutional layer, integrating it into the bottleneck of the network; The SmaAt-Krige-GNet model combines precipitation maps with weather station data processed using Kriging, a geo-statistical interpolation method, to generate variable-specific maps. These maps are then utilized in a dual-encoder architecture based on SmaAt-GNet, allowing multi-level data integration . Experimental evaluations were conducted using four years (2016--2019) of weather station and precipitation radar data from the Netherlands. Results demonstrate that SmaAt-Krige-GNet outperforms the standard SmaAt-UNet, which relies solely on precipitation radar data, in low precipitation scenarios, while SmaAt-fUsion surpasses SmaAt-UNet in both low and high precipitation scenarios. This highlights the potential of incorporating discrete weather station data to enhance the performance of deep learning-based weather nowcasting models.</description>
