      <title>Fast Electromagnetic and RF Circuit Co-Simulation for Passive Resonator Field Calculation and Optimization in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive resonators have been widely used in MRI to manipulate RF field distributions. However, optimizing these structures using full-wave electromagnetic simulations is computationally prohibitive, particularly for large passive resonator arrays with many degrees of freedom. This work presents a co-simulation framework tailored specifically for the analysis and optimization of passive resonators. The framework performs a single full-wave electromagnetic simulation in which the resonator's lumped components are replaced by ports, followed by circuit-level computations to evaluate arbitrary capacitor and inductor configurations. This allows integration with a genetic algorithm to rapidly optimize resonator parameters and enhance the B1 field in a targeted region of interest (ROI). We validated the method in three scenarios: (1) a single-loop passive resonator on a spherical phantom, (2) a two-loop array on a cylindrical phantom, and (3) a two-loop array on a human head model. In all cases, the co-simulation results showed excellent agreement with full-wave simulations, with relative errors below 1%. The genetic-algorithm-driven optimization, involving tens of thousands of capacitor combinations, completed in under 5 minutes, whereas equivalent full-wave EM sweeps would require an impractically long computation time. This work extends co-simulation methodology to passive resonator design for first time, enabling the fast, accurate, and scalable optimization. The approach significantly reduces computational burden while preserving full-wave accuracy, making it a powerful tool for passive RF structure development in MRI.</description>

      <title>Quantitative In Vivo Cherenkov Luminescence Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-86-NM600</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The expansion of radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) development demands scalable preclinical dosimetry methods. While PET and SPECT remain the gold standards, their low throughput and high cost limit large-cohort studies. Cherenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) offers a high-throughput alternative but suffers from depth-dependent attenuation and photon scatter that compromise quantitative accuracy. This work develops and validates a quantitative CLI methodology incorporating attenuation and scatter corrections for accurate preclinical dosimetry. Methods: Depth-dependent attenuation was characterized using a tissue-mimicking phantom to derive calibration coefficients. Photon scatter was modeled using GEANT4-generated Cherenkov spread functions (CSFs), applied in a depth-weighted iterative Richardson--Lucy deconvolution/reconvolution framework. The method was evaluated in NU/NU mice (n=4) bearing MC38 tumors after injection of $^{86}$Y-NM600, an isotope suitable for both PET and CLI. Liver and tumor activities were quantified at four timepoints using PET and the proposed CLI method. Monte Carlo dosimetry was performed for both modalities. Results: CLI--PET activity quantification yielded mean errors of 15.4% (liver) and 10.3% (tumor) over the first three timepoints. Tumor absorbed doses from CLI-derived synthetic PET images (3.4 $\pm$ 0.3 Gy/MBq) were statistically indistinguishable from PET-based estimates (3.2 $\pm$ 0.2 Gy/MBq, $p=0.31$). Discrepancies increased at late timepoints due to low activity and background auto-luminescence. Conclusions: With appropriate depth-dependent attenuation calibration and Monte Carlo--derived scatter correction, CLI can provide quantitative biodistribution and dosimetry estimates comparable to PET. This approach enables high-throughput, low-cost in vivo dosimetry, expanding the feasibility of large-scale preclinical RPT studies.</description>

      <title>Generative Consistency Models for Estimation of Kinetic Parametric Image Posteriors in Total-Body PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic total body positron emission tomography (TB-PET) makes it feasible to measure the kinetics of all organs in the body simultaneously which may lead to important applications in multi-organ disease and systems physiology. Since whole-body kinetics are highly heterogeneous with variable signal-to-noise ratios, parametric images should ideally comprise not only point estimates but also measures of posterior statistical uncertainty. However, standard Bayesian techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), are computationally prohibitive at the total body scale. We introduce a generative consistency model (CM) that generates samples from the posterior distributions of the kinetic model parameters given measured time-activity curves and arterial input function. CM is able to collapse the hundreds of iterations required by standard diffusion models into just 3 denoising steps. When trained on 500,000 physiologically realistic two-tissue compartment model simulations, the CM produces similar accuracy to MCMC (median absolute percent error &lt; 5%; median K-L divergence &lt; 0.5) but is more than five orders of magnitude faster. CM produces more reliable Ki images than the Patlak method by avoiding the assumption of irreversibility, while also offering valuable information on statistical uncertainty of parameter estimates and the underlying model. The proposed framework removes the computational barrier to routine, fully Bayesian parametric imaging in TB-PET and is readily extensible to other tracers and compartment models.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of literature $T_1$ mapping methods to the underlying magnetization transfer parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) has been identified as the principal source of $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature. This study assesses the sensitivity of established $T_1$ mapping techniques to variations in the underlying MT parameters.
  Methods: For each $T_1$-mapping method, the observed $T_1$ was simulated as a function of the underlying MT parameters $p_i^\text{MT}$, corresponding to different brain regions of interest (ROIs) at 3T. As measures of sensitivity, the derivatives $\partial T_1^\text{observed} / \partial p_i^\text{MT}$ were computed and analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model as a function of $p_i^\text{MT}$, ROI, pulse sequence type (e.g., inversion recovery, variable flip angle), and the individual sequences.
  Results: The analyzed $T_1$-mapping sequences have a considerable sensitivity to changes in the semi-solid spin pool size $m_0^\text{s}$, $T_1^\text{f}$ of the free, $T_1^\text{s}$ of the semi-solid spin pool, and the (inverse) exchange rate $T_\text{x}$. All derivatives vary considerably with the underlying MT parameters and between pulse sequences. The derivatives can, in general, not be determined by the sequence type, but rather depend on implementation details of the sequence. One notable exception is that variable-flip-angle methods are, in general, more sensitive to the exchange rate than inversion-recovery methods.
  Conclusion: Variations in $T_1$ measurements can be caused by several underlying MT parameters, and the sensitivity to each parameter depends on both the underlying MT parameters and the sequence.</description>

      <title>Scattering approach to diffusion quantifies axonal damage in brain injury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early diagnosis and noninvasive monitoring of neurological disorders require sensitivity to elusive cellular-level alterations that occur much earlier than volumetric changes observable with the millimeter-resolution of medical imaging modalities. Morphological changes in axons, such as axonal varicosities or beadings, are observed in neurological disorders, as well as in development and aging. Here, we reveal the sensitivity of time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) to the structurally disordered axonal morphology at the micrometer scale. Scattering theory uncovers the two parameters that determine the diffusive dynamics of water along axons: the average reciprocal cross-section and the variance of long-range cross-sectional fluctuations. This theoretical development allows us to predict dMRI metrics sensitive to axonal alterations over tens of thousands of axons in seconds rather than months of simulations in a rat model of traumatic brain injury, and is corroborated with ex vivo dMRI. Our approach bridges the gap between micrometers and millimeters in resolution, offering quantitative and objective biomarkers applicable to a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>Theoretical novel medical isotope production with deuterium-tritium fusion technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The emergence and growth of fusion technology enables investigative studies into its applications beyond typical power production facilities. This study seeks to determine the viability of medical isotope production with the neutrons produced in an example large fusion device. Using FISPACT-II (a nuclear inventory code) and a simulated fusion spectrum, the production yields of a significant number of potentially clinically relevant (both in use and novel) medical isotopes were calculated. Comparative calculations were also conducted against existing production routes.
  Results: Depending on the neutron flux of the fusion device, it could be an ideal technology to produce alpha-emitters such as 212Bi/212Pb, it may be able to contribute to the production of 99mTc/99Mo, and could offer an alternative route in the production a few Auger-emitting candidates. There is also a long list of beta-emitting nuclides where fusion technology may be best placed to produce over existing technologies including 67Cu, 90Y and 47Sc.
  Conclusions: It is theoretically viable to produce existing and novel medical isotopes with fusion technology. However, a significant number of assumptions form the basis of this study which would need to be studied further for any particular nuclide of interest.</description>
