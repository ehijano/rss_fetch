      <title>Hyperbolicity of adjoint linear series on varieties with positive tangent bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $n\geq 3$, and let $L$ be an ample line bundle on $X$. In this article, we study the algebraic hyperbolicity of a very general section of the adjoint linear series $|K_X+mL|$ when the tangent bundle $T_X$ of $X$ has suitable positivity properties. As a consequence, we show that the linear system $|K_X+mL|$ is hyperbolic (or pseudo-hyperbolic) for $m\geq 3n+1$, for various classes of polarized pairs $(X,L)$, thus providing new evidence of a conjecture that was proposed by the second and fourth authors. Moreover, when $X$ is abelian, we show that the linear system $|mL|$ is hyperbolic for $m\geq n$, and the same holds when $m\geq n-1$, if $|L|$ has no base divisors. It turns out that these bounds for abelian varieties are sharp. We also prove analogous statements for Kummer varieties and certain classes of hyperelliptic varieties.</description>

      <title>Two lectures on the enumeration of curves by means of floor diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss, following Mikhalkin, Brugall\'e, and many others, the counting of curves on toric surfaces with prescribed genus, Newton polygon, and intersection pattern with the toric boundary divisor, both at assigned and unassigned points.
  The first lecture is dedicated to the proof of a correspondence theorem (for plane curves) with the counting of floor diagrams, using a degeneration of the projective plane to a chain of rational ruled surfaces. This is due to Brugall\'e and does not involve any tropical geometry.
  The second lecture explores the relations with tropical geometry, and contains an introduction to toric varieties and tropical geometry. We discuss the correspondence theorem of Mikhalkin, and show how the corresponding tropical enumerative problem can be formulated in terms of the combinatorial problem of counting floor diagrams. We give many examples throughout, inspired by the study of the enumerative geometry of $K3$ surfaces, by degeneration to unions of rational surfaces with dual complex a tiling of the $\mathbf{S}^2$ sphere.</description>

      <title>The Enriques surface of minimal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lehmer's number $\lambda_{10}$ is the smallest dynamical degree greater than $1$ that can occur for an automorphism of an algebraic surface. We show that $\lambda_{10}$ cannot be realized by automorphisms of Enriques surfaces in odd characteristic, extending a result of Oguiso over the complex numbers. In contrast, we prove that in characteristic $2$ there exists a unique Enriques surface that admits an automorphism with dynamical degree $\lambda_{10}$. We also provide explicit equations for the surface as well as for all conjugacy classes of automorphisms that realize $\lambda_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Stronger Bogomolov--Gieseker type inequality on quintic threefold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a stronger Bogomolov--Gieseker type inequality for slope-semistable sheaves on the smooth quintic threefold. Our approach combines a refined restriction theorem for tilt-stable objects with explicit Clifford-type bounds for semistable bundles on plane quintic curves. As a consequence, we obtain an explicit piecewise linear inequality on the Chern characters of any slope-semistable sheaf improving upon the classical Bogomolov--Gieseker bound and implying Toda's conjectural inequality.
  The method also yields a stronger Bogomolov--Gieseker type inequality on smooth quintic surfaces.
  These results provide new evidence toward the existence of a Bridgeland stability condition of Gepner type on the quintic threefold.</description>

      <title>From double-scaled SYK correlators to Weil-Petersson volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Okuyama introduced a family of polynomials, whose coefficients depend on a parameter $q$, in his study of correlators in the double-scaled SYK model. He verified in small cases that their coefficients can be expressed in terms of certain $q$-zeta values and that the polynomials recover the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces studied by Mirzakhani under a certain $q \to 1$ limit. In this paper, we provide mathematically rigorous proofs of these two phenomena. The authors previously defined natural $q$-deformations of the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of curves. We prove that these polynomials appear as the top degree part of Okuyama's polynomials. Our work provides a link between the two topics of the title, which hints at a ``quantum'' Weil-Petersson geometry and a combinatorial-geometric approach to double-scaled SYK correlators.</description>

      <title>The Self-Projecting Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the self-projecting Grassmannian, an irreducible subvariety of the Grassmannian parametrizing linear subspaces that satisfy a generalized self-duality condition. We study its relation to classical moduli spaces, such as the moduli spaces of pointed curves of genus $g$, as well as to other natural subvarieties of the Grassmannian. We further translate the self-projectivity condition in the combinatorial language of matroids, introducing self-projecting matroids, and we computationally investigate their realization spaces inside the self-projecting Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the tame Brauer group of open varieties over local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this document we let $U$ be a smooth variety of pure dimension $d$ over a local field $k_v$ with unit ball $\mathcal{O}_v$ and residue field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$ and we set $n$ to be a positive integer such that $p\nmid n$. For various $u\in U(k_v)$ we study the evaluation map $u^*:\mathrm{H}^2(U,\mu_n)\to \mathrm{H}^2(k_v,\mu_n)$. We suppose that $U$ embeds as an open subscheme in a regular scheme $\mathcal{X}$ that is of finite type over $\mathcal{O}_v$. We assume that $Z:=\mathcal{X}\setminus U$ is a divisor and we endow it with its reduced scheme structure. We show that for $u_1,u_2\in U(k_v)$ that lift to $x_1,x_2\in \mathcal{X}(\mathcal{O}_v)$ we obtain the same evaluation map $u_1^*=u_2^*$ under the two conditions that first, there is an equality of reductions $\overline{x_1}=\overline{x_2}$ in $\mathcal{X}(\mathbb{F})$ and second, that $\mathrm{cl}(x_1\cap Z)=\mathrm{cl}(x_2\cap Z)$ holds in $\mathrm{H}^{2d}_{|\overline{x}|}(Z,\mu_n^{\otimes d})$.</description>

      <title>The $d$-gonal locus in the moduli space of tropical plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the locus $\mathbb{M}_{g,d}^\textrm{nd}$ of genus $g$ tropical plane curves of gonality $d$ inside the moduli space $\mathbb{M}^{\textrm{nd}}_{g}$ of tropical plane curves of genus $g$. Each such tropical curve arises from a Newton polygon, and we conjecture that the gonality of the tropical curve is equal to an easily computed parameter of this polygon called the expected gonality, closely related to the lattice width of the polygon. Let $\mathbb{M}_{g,{\underline{d}}}^\textrm{nd}$ denote the locus of tropical curves whose associated Newton polygon has expected gonality $d$. We prove that for fixed $d$ and sufficiently large genus $g$, the dimensions of these two loci agree: \[ \\dim\left(\mathbb{M}_{g,d}^\textrm{nd}\right) =\dim\left(\mathbb{M}_{g,{\underline{d}}}^\textrm{nd}\right). \] Our results provide evidence that, in sufficiently high genus compared to expected gonality, the gonality of a tropical curve is determined by the expected gonality of the Newton polygon from which it arises.</description>

      <title>Varieties of Lines in 3-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider configurations of lines in 3-space with incidences prescribed by a graph. This defines a subvariety in a product of Grassmannians. Leveraging a connection with rigidity theory in the plane, for any graph, we determine the dimension of the incidence variety and characterize when it is irreducible or a complete intersection. We study its multidegree and the family of Schubert problems it encodes. Our spanning-tree coordinates enable efficient symbolic computations. We also provide numerical irreducible decompositions for incidence varieties with up to eight lines. These constructions with lines play a key role in the Landau analysis of scattering amplitudes in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Analogue of the Galois Theory for arbitrary finite field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a finishing touch to the (over 200 years) {\em classical} `Galois Theory' of {\em arbitrary} finite field extensions, i.e. the goal of it is to describe intermediate subfields of an arbitrary finite field extension via {\em invariants} of `natural/obvious' objects that are associated with subfields via two Galois-type correspondences.
  The classical Galois Theory covers the case of finite Galois field extensions. For finite Galois field extensions the objects are their Galois groups and their invariants.
  In \cite{GaloisTh-RingThAp}, we introduce a new (ring theoretic) approach to the Galois Theory which is based on
  the {\em principle of maximal symmetry}. In \cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}, the maximal symmetry of {\em normal} finite field extensions yields an analogue of the Galois Theory for them. For a normal finite field extension $L/K$ the `natural/obvious' objects are the subalgebra $\CD (L/K)\rtimes G(L/K)$ of $\End (L/K)$ that is generated by the automorphism group $G(L/K)$ and the algebra $\CD (L/K)$ of differential operators on $L/K$ and its `invariants'. The `maximal symmetry' means the equality $\End (L/K)=\CD (L/K)\rtimes G(L/K)$ which turns out to be a characteristic property of {\em normal} finite field extensions, \cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}.
  The aim of this paper is to obtain an analogue of the Galois Theory for {\em arbitrary} finite field extensions based on results and ideas of \cite{GaloisTh-RingThAp} and \cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an extension of the classical irreducibility result of Dumas, a factorization result for polynomials over any valued field with a Krull valuation of arbitrary rank is proved. Further, a lower degree factor bound on factors of a given polynomial over a valued field with a Krull valuation is proved. These factorization results not only unify several known irreducibility results for polynomials over the said domains but also provide us sharp bounds on degrees of irreducible factors of the underlying polynomials.</description>

      <title>Extendability of group actions on K3 or Enriques surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a K3 or Enriques surface with good reduction. Let $G$ be a finite group acting (not necessarily linearly) on $X$. We give a criterion for this group action to extend to a smooth model of $X$ in terms of the action of $G$ on the second $\ell$-adic cohomology groups. In particular, we generalize the result on the extendability of Galois actions on K3 surfaces by Chiarellotto, Lazda, and Liedtke. As an application, we prove that a symplectic linear group action is extendable if the residue characteristic does not divide its order. Lastly, we relate the good reduction of Enriques surfaces with that of their K3 double covers.</description>

      <title>Point-like non-commutative families of bounding cochains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define genus zero open Gromov-Witten invariants with boundary and interior constraints for a Lagrangian submanifold of arbitrary even dimension. The definition relies on constructing a canonical family of bounding cochains that satisfy the point-like condition of the second author and Tukachinsky. Since the Lagrangian is even dimensional, the parameter of the family is odd. Thus, to avoid the vanishing of invariants with more than one boundary constraint, the parameter must be non-commutative. The invariants are defined either when the Lagrangian is a rational cohomology sphere or when the Lagrangian is fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, has dimension $2$ modulo $4$, and its cohomology is that of a sphere aside from degree $1$ modulo $4$. In dimension $2$, these invariants recover Welschinger's invariants.
  We develop an obstruction theory for the existence and uniqueness of bounding cochains in a Fukaya $A_\infty$ algebra with non-commutative coefficients. The obstruction classes belong to twisted cohomology groups of the Lagrangian instead of the de Rham cohomology of the commutative setting. A spectral sequence is constructed to compute the twisted cohomology groups. The extension of scalars of an $A_\infty$ algebra by a non-commutative ring is treated in detail. A theory of pseudo-completeness is introduced to guarantee the convergence of the Maurer-Cartan equation, which defines bounding cochains, even though the non-commutative parameter is given zero filtration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.12742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a variant of the Beauville--Bogomolov decomposition for weakly ordinary, or generally globally $F$-split, varieties $X$ with $K_X \sim 0$, in characteristic $p&gt;0$. We also show that the weakly ordinary assumption in our statement cannot be dropped. Additionally, if the assumption $K_X \sim 0$ is replaced by $-K_X$ being semi-ample, we show the weaker statement that all closed fibers of the Albanese morphism are isomorphic. Finally, we apply our main theorem to draw consequences to the behavior of rational points and fundamental groups of weakly ordinary $K$-trivial varieties in positive characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01856v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is aimed to discussing three kinds of problems:
  (1) producing some ``mirror theorem'' for the recent mirror symmetric construction, called \emph{framed} duality ($f$-duality), described in \cite{R-fTV} and \cite{R-fpCI}: this is performed from the point of view proposed by Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS), by studying \emph{derived equivalence} ($D$-equivalence) of multiple mirror models produced by means of a, so-called, \emph{uncalibrated $f$-process}; (2) proposing a general construction giving a big number of multiple mirror models to, in principle, any projective complete intersection of non-negative Kodaira dimension: these multiple mirrors turn out to be each other connected by means of uncalibrated $f$-processes and then, after (1), $D$-equivalent or $K$-equivalent, in the sense of Kawamata \cite{Kawamata}; (3) presenting a number of evidences for the Bondal-Orlov-Kawamata conjecture that $D$-equivalence is $K$-equivalence, and viceversa.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions in the mathematical Gauged Linear Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of Mixed-Spin-P (MSP) fields was introduced by Chang-Li-Li-Liu for the quintic threefold, aiming at studying its higher-genus Gromov-Witten invariants. Chang-Guo-Li has successfully applied it to prove conjectures including the BCOV Feynman rule, Yamaguchi-Yau's polynomiality conjecture and the Holomorphic Anomaly Equation. Meanwhile, Fan-Jarvis-Ruan introduced a mathematical theory of Gauged Linear Sigma Model (GLSM), associating a counting theory to a GIT quotient with a super-potential, under suitable assumptions.
  This paper provides a common generalization of both works, by introducing new stability conditions in the mathematical GLSM. We show that our stability condition guarantees the separatedness and properness of the cosection degeneracy locus in the moduli. It generalizes the MSP fields construction to more general GIT quotients, including Calabi-Yau global complete intersections in toric varieties. This hopefully provides a geometric platform to effectively compute their higher-genus Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive group acting on an affine scheme $V$. We study the set of principal $G$-bundles on a smooth projective curve $\mathcal C$ such that the associated $V$-bundle admits a section sending the generic point of $\mathcal C$ into the GIT stable locus $V^{\mathrm{s}}(\theta)$. We show that after fixing the degree of the line bundle induced by the character $\theta$, the set of such principal $G$-bundles is bounded. The statement of our theorem is made slightly more general so that we deduce from it the boundedness for $\epsilon$-stable quasimaps and $\Omega$-stable LG-quasimap.</description>

      <title>A topological algorithm for the Fourier transform of Stokes data at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a topological description of the behaviour of Stokes matrices under the Fourier transform from infinity to infinity in a large number of cases of one level. This explicit, algorithmic statement is obtained by building on a recent result of T. Mochizuki about the Fourier transform of Stokes data of irregular connections on the Riemann sphere and by using the language of Stokes local systems due to P. Boalch. In particular, this induces explicit isomorphisms between wild character varieties, in a much larger range of examples than those for which such isomorphisms have previously been written down. We conjecture that these isomorphisms are compatible with the quasi-Hamiltonian structure on the wild character varieties.</description>

      <title>Monodromy in the space of symmetric cubic surfaces with a line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the enumerative problem of finding lines on cubic surfaces defined by symmetric polynomials. We prove that the moduli space of symmetric cubic surfaces is an arithmetic quotient of the complex hyperbolic line, and determine constraints on the monodromy group of lines on symmetric cubic surfaces arising from Hodge theory and geometry of the associated cover. This interestingly fails to pin down the entire Galois group. Leveraging computations in equivariant line geometry and homotopy continuation, we prove that the Galois group is the Klein 4-group. This means that, despite a general cubic surface admitting no formula in radicals for its lines, an $S_4$-symmetric cubic does; we work out these formulas explicitly. This is the first computation in what promises to be an interesting direction of research: studying monodromy in classical enumerative problems restricted by a finite group of symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We determine the ring structure of the torus-equivariant cohomology of rank-one juggling varieties with rational coefficients. By realizing these varieties as cyclic quiver Grassmannians, we construct a Knutson--Tao type basis for their equivariant cohomology. Using this basis, we give an explicit description of the ring structure in terms of generators and relations, and compute the corresponding structure constants. Finally, we show that these structure constants are integral.</description>

      <title>Spence-Kummer's trilogarithm functional equation and its underlying geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underlying geometry of the Spence--Kummer functional equation for the trilogarithm. Our geometry determines a certain path system on the projective line minus three points, connecting the standard tangential base point to the nine variables of the $Li_{3}$ terms in the equation, which reflects the geometry of the so-called non-Fano arrangement. Consequently, we derive a precise form of the Spence--Kummer equation together with its $\ell$-adic Galois analogue by using algebraic relations between polylogarithm generating series arising from the path system. We apply the tensor and homotopy criteria for functional equations of iterated integrals due to Zagier and Nakamura--Wojtkowiak. To compute the lower-degree terms of the functional equation in both the complex and the $\ell$-adic Galois cases, we also focus on a diagram of three geometric objects: the moduli space $M_{0,5}$, the complement to the Coxeter arrangement of type ${\rm B_3}$, and the complement to the non-Fano arrangement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positive geometries are semialgebraic sets equipped with a canonical differential form whose residues mirror the boundary structure of the geometry. Every full-dimensional projective polytope is a positive geometry. Motivated by the canonical forms of polytopes, we construct a canonical form for any tope of an oriented matroid, inside the Orlik--Solomon algebra of the underlying matroid. Using these canonical forms, we construct bases for the Orlik--Solomon algebra of a matroid, and for the Aomoto cohomology. These bases of canonical forms are a foundational input in the theory of matroid amplitudes introduced by the second author.</description>

      <title>Analytical Solvers for Common Algebraic Equations Arising in Kinematics Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents analytical solvers for four common types of algebraic equations encountered in robot kinematics: single trigonometric equations, single-angle trigonometric systems, two-angle trigonometric systems, and bilinear two-angle systems. These equations arise frequently in the kinematics problems, particularly in robot kinematics. We provide detailed solution methods, including closed-form expressions, numerical algorithms, and robustness considerations. The solvers are designed to handle general coefficients, manage singularities, and enumerate all real solutions efficiently. These solvers are implemented in Python packages and can be reproduced by prompting Language Lanuage Models. Sampe prompts are also provided in the public code space Github repo. These prompts can generate a working solver code with one single prompt in coding agent such as OpenAI's Codex 5.1. This work serves as a foundation for developing complete inverse kinematics solvers for various robot architectures. Extensive validation and benchmarking demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A conjecture in Schanuel style for 1-motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schanuel Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function. In particular it implies the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem. In my Ph.D. I showed that Schanuel Conjecture has a geometrical origin: it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive without abelian part.
  In this paper, we state a conjecture in Schanuel style, which will imply conjectures in Lindemann-Weierstrass style, for the semi-elliptic exponential function, that is for the exponential map of an extension G of an elliptic curve E by a multiplicative group. We propose the semi-elliptic Conjecture, which concerns the exponential function, the Weierstrass $\wp,$ $\zeta$ functions and Serre functions. The case of a trivial extension has been treated in \cite{BW}, where we introduced the split semi-elliptic Conjecture.
  As in Schanuel's case, we expect that the semi-elliptic Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function, of the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ functions and of Serre functions.
  We show that the semi-elliptic Conjecture has a geometrical origin (as Schanuel Conjecture): it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive whose underlying abelian part is an elliptic curve.
  We prove the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture for 1-motives defined by an elliptic curve with algebraic invariants and complex multiplication and by torsion points.
  We introduce the $\sigma$-Conjecture which involves the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ and $\sigma$ functions and we show that this conjecture is a consequence of the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to an adequate 1-motive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working in a generic derived algebro-geometric context, we lay the foundations for the general study of affineness and local descendability. When applied to $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ rings equipped with the fpqc topology, these foundations give an $\infty$-category of spectral stacks, a viable functor-of-points alternative to Lurie's approach to nonconnective spectral algebraic geometry. Specializing further to spectral stacks over the moduli stack of oriented formal groups, we use chromatic homotopy theory to obtain a large class of $0$-affine stacks, generalizing Mathew--Meier's famous $0$-affineness result. We introduce a spectral refinement of Hopkins' stack construction of an $\mathbf{E}_\infty$ ring, and study when it provides an inverse to the global sections of a spectral stack. We use this to show that a large class of stacks, which we call reconstructible, are naturally determined by their global sections, including moduli stacks of oriented formal groups of bounded height and the moduli stack of oriented elliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a discretely valued Henselian field. Creutz and Viray show that the degree set of a curve $C$ over a $p$-adic field can miss infinitely many multiples of the index of $C$, a phenomenon that cannot occur over finitely generated fields. For curves $C/K$ with a cyclic cover of $\mathbb{P}^1$ of prime degree, under mild assumptions, we completely characterize how and when this behavior can occur, and give a method for computing degree sets of curves of this type.</description>
