      <title>An algorithm to align a chain of sequences to paths in a pangenome graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affordable, high-quality whole-genome assemblies have made it possible to construct rich pangenomes that capture haplotype diversity across many species. As these datasets grow, they motivate the development of specialized techniques capable of handling the dense sequence variation found in large groups of related genomes. A common strategy is to encode pangenomic information in graph form, which provides a flexible substrate for improving algorithms in areas such as alignment, visualization, and functional analysis. Methods built on these graph models have already shown clear advantages in core bioinformatics workflows, including read mapping, variant discovery, and genotyping. By integrating multiple sequence and coordinate representations into a single structure, pangenome graphs offer a unified and expressive framework for comparative genomics. Although it remains unclear whether graph-based references will ultimately supplant traditional linear genomes, their versatility ensures that they will play a central role in emerging pangenomic approaches. This paper introduces an algorithm to mine a chain of sequences in pangenome graphs that might be useful in the functional analysis of pangenome graphs. Specifically, the algorithm calculates all maximal paths in a pangenome graph aligning with a given chain of sequences in the segments of the path vertices, possibly with some maximal gap as specified by the user.</description>

      <title>Prediction of PLX-4720 Sensitivity in Cancer Cell Lines through Multi-Omics Integration and Attention-Based Fusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to PLX-4720, a preclinical BRAF inhibitor, requires models capable of capturing the multilayered regulation of oncogenic signaling. Single-omics predictors are often insufficient because drug response is shaped by interactions among genomic alterations, epigenetic regulation, transcriptional activity, protein signaling, metabolic state, and network-level context. In this study we develop an attention-based multi-omics integration framework using genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and protein interaction data from the GDSC1 panel. Each modality is encoded into a latent representation using feed-forward neural networks or graph convolutional networks, and fused through an attention mechanism that assigns modality-specific importance weights. A regression model is then used to predict PLX-4720 response. Across single- and multi-omics configurations, the best performance is achieved by integrating genomics and transcriptomics, which yields validation R2 values above 0.92. This reflects the complementary roles of mutational status and downstream transcriptional activation in shaping sensitivity to BRAF inhibition. Epigenomics is the strongest single-omics predictor, while metabolomics and PPI data contribute additional context when combined with other modalities. Integration of three to five omics layers improves stability but does not surpass the accuracy of the best two-modality combinations, likely due to information redundancy and sample-size imbalance. These findings highlight the importance of modality selection rather than maximal data depth. The proposed framework provides an efficient and biologically grounded strategy for drug response prediction and supports the development of precision pharmacogenomics.</description>

      <title>Dy-mer: An Explainable DNA Sequence Representation Scheme using Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA sequences encode critical genetic information, yet their variable length and discrete nature impede direct utilization in deep learning models. Existing DNA representation schemes convert sequences into numerical vectors but fail to capture structural features of local subsequences and often suffer from limited interpretability and poor generalization on small datasets. To address these limitations, we propose Dy-mer, an interpretable and robust DNA representation scheme based on dictionary learning. Dy-mer formulates an optimization problem in tensor format, which ensures computational efficiency in batch processing. Our scheme reconstructs DNA sequences as concatenations of dynamic-length subsequences (dymers) through a convolution operation and simultaneously optimize a learnable dymer dictionary and sparse representations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as DNA promoter classification and motif detection. Experiments further show that the learned dymers match known DNA motifs and clustering using Dy-mer yields semantically meaningful phylogenetic trees. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves both strong predictive performance and high interpretability, making it well suited for biological research applications.</description>
