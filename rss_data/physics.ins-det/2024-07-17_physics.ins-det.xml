      <title>A digital four-arm bridge for the comparison of resistance with capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have built and demonstrated a digital four-arm bridge for the comparison of resistance with capacitance. The digital bridge mimics the classical quad bridge in the digital domain with three balances: the source balance, the detector balance, as well as the main balance. Due to correlation, the required precision of the source voltages is only of the order of the square root of the ultimate bridge precision. For the comparison of a 100 k$\Omega$ resistor with a 1 nF capacitor near 1592 Hz the combined standard uncertainty (k = 1) is $5\times 10^{-9}$.</description>

      <title>TCAD modeling of radiation-induced defects in 4H-SiC diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) has several advantageous properties compared to Silicon (Si) that make it an appealing detector material, such as a larger charge carrier saturation velocity, bandgap, and thermal conductivity. While the current understanding of material and model parameters suffices to simulate unirradiated 4H-SiC devices using technical computer-aided design (TCAD), configurations to accurately predict performance degradation after high levels of irradiation due to induced defects acting as traps and recombination centers do not exist. Despite increasing efforts to characterize the introduction and nature of such defects in 4H-SiC, published results are often contradictory. This work presents a bulk radiation damage model for TCAD simulations based on measurements on 50 $\mu m$ 4H-SiC pad diodes, neutron-irradiated at various fluxes ranging from $5\times 10^{14}$ $n_{eq}/cm^2$ to $1\times 10^{16}$ $n_{eq}/cm^2$. The model accurately predicts internal electric shifts, such as flattening of the detector capacitance, degradation in charge collection efficiency (CCE), and signal detection capabilities under forward bias conditions up to high bias. It further introduces the EH$_4$ defect cluster as major lifetime killer and reinforces the assumption of the EH$_{6,7}$ deep-level defect to be of donor type.</description>

      <title>A practical approach to calculating magnetic Johnson noise for precision measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with commercially available finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Calibration and simulation of ionization signal and electronics noise in the ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector has been taking physics data since 2022 as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program. This paper details the equalization of the response to charge in the ICARUS time projection chamber (TPC), as well as data-driven tuning of the simulation of ionization charge signals and electronics noise. The equalization procedure removes non-uniformities in the ICARUS TPC response to charge in space and time. This work leverages the copious number of cosmic ray muons available to ICARUS at the surface. The ionization signal shape simulation applies a novel procedure that tunes the simulation to match what is measured in data. The end result of the equalization procedure and simulation tuning allows for a comparison of charge measurements in ICARUS between Monte Carlo simulation and data, showing good performance with minimal residual bias between the two.</description>

      <title>Scintillation characteristics of an undoped CsI crystal at low-temperature for dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scintillation characteristics of 1 g undoped CsI crystal were studied by directly coupling two silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) over a temperature range from room temperature to 86 K. The scintillation decay time and light output were measured using x-ray and gamma-ray peaks from a $^{109}$Cd radioactive source. An increase in decay time was observed as the temperature decreased from room temperature to 86 K, ranging from 76 ns to 605 ns. The light output increased as well, reaching 37.9 $\pm$ 1.5 photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent at 86 K, which is approximately 18 times higher than the light yield at room temperature. Leveraging the significantly enhanced scintillation light output of the undoped CsI crystal at low temperature, coupling it with SiPMs results into a promising detector for dark matter search. Both cesium and iodine have a proton odd number, thus they are suitable targets to probe dark matter-proton spin dependent interactions. We evaluated the sensitivity of the detector here proposed to light dark matter-proton spin dependent interactions. We included the Migdal effect and assumed 200\,kg of undoped CsI crystals for the dark matter search. We conclude that undoped CsI coupled to SiPM can exhibit world-competitive sensitivities for low-mass dark matter detection, particularly for the dark matter-proton spin-dependent interaction.</description>

      <title>Compact Ion Beam System for Fusion Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact ion beam device capable of accelerating H$^+$ and D$^+$ ions up to 75keV energy, on to a solid target, with sufficient beam current to study fusion reactions. The ion beam system uses a microwave driven plasma source to generate ions that are accelerated to high energy with a DC acceleration structure. The plasma source is driven by pulsed microwaves from a solid-state RF amplifier, which is impedance matched to the plasma source chamber at the ISM band frequency (2.4-2.5GHz). The plasma chamber is held at high positive DC potential and is isolated from the impedance matching structure (at ground potential) by a dielectric-filled gap. To facilitate the use of high-energy-particle detectors near the target, the plasma chamber is biased to a high positive voltage, while the target remains grounded. A target loaded with deuterium is used to study D-D fusion and a B$_4$C or LaB$_6$ target is used to study p-$^{11}$B fusion. Detectors include solid-state charged particle detector and a scintillation fast neutron detector. The complete ion beam system can fit on a laboratory table and is a useful tool for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about the physics of fusion.</description>

      <title>Model for bubble nucleation efficiency of low-energy nuclear recoils in bubble chambers for dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bubble chambers are promising technologies for detecting low-energy nuclear recoils from the elastic scattering of dark matter particle candidates. Bubble nucleation occurs when the energy deposition exceeds a specific threshold defined traditionally by the "heat-spike" Seitz threshold. In this paper, we report on a physical model that can account for observed discrepancies between the current Seitz model and the measured nucleation efficiency of low-energy nuclear recoils, which is necessary for interpreting dark matter signals. In our work, we combine molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations together with the Lindhard model to predict bubble nucleation efficiency and energy thresholds for C$_3$F$_8$, CF$_3$I, and xenon with enhanced accuracy over the Seitz model when compared to existing experimental data. We use our model to determine the effect on cross-section limits for spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions and compare it to the current PICO dark matter experiment. Our technique can also be applied to estimate the efficiency of future target fluids where no experimental data are available. As an example, we predict the nucleation efficiency, the energy threshold and the cross-section limits in the spin-independent channel for the Scintillating Bubble Chamber experiment filled with superheated liquid argon.</description>

      <title>Expected Performance of Cosmic Muon Veto Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The India-Based Neutrino Observatory (INO) collaboration houses the miniICAL detector, at the transit campus of IICHEP, Madurai, India, which serves as a prototype-detector of the larger Iron-Calorimeter detector (ICAL). The purpose of miniICAL lies in unraveling the intricate engineering challenges inherent in constructing a substantial ICAL-type detector. To explore the feasibility of building a large-scale neutrino experiment at shallow depths the collaboration has embarked upon the construction of a Cosmic Muon Veto Detector (CMVD) around the miniICAL detector. The primary objective of this endeavor revolves around attaining a veto efficiency surpassing $99.99\%$, while simultaneously maintaining a false-positive rate lower than $10^{-5}$.
  The CMVD system is based on extruded plastic scintillators (EPS) and utilizes wavelength-shifting fibers to collect scintillation photons and uses silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) as photo-transducers. The expected performance of the CMVD is estimated using simulated muon tracks in the miniICAL stack taking into account efficiency, multiplicity of RPC detectors from the miniICAL data as well as the noise of SiPM, observed SiPM spectra and time resolution due to cosmic muon along the whole length of EPS etc.
  The CMVD experiment is a crucial step in the larger context of neutrino research, by increasing the veto efficiency of cosmic muons, the CMVD experiment helps to pave the way for future large-scale shallow-depth neutrino experiments, providing valuable insights into the study of neutrinos and their properties.</description>
