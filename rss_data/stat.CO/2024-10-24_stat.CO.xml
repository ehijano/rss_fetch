      <title>A fresh view on Least Quantile of Squares Regression based on new optimization approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regression analysis is an important instrument to determine the effect of the explanatory variables on response variables. When outliers and bias errors are present, the standard weighted least squares estimator may perform poorly. For this reason, many alternative robust techniques have been studied in literature. In these terms, the Least Squares Quantile (LQS), and in particular the Least Squares Median, are among the regression estimators that exhibit better robustness properties. However, the accurate computation of this estimators is computationally demanding, resulting in a difficult estimator to obtain. In this paper, new novel approaches to compute a global optimal solution for the LQS estimator based on single-level and bilevel optimization methods are proposed. An extensive computational study is provided to support the efficiency of the methods considered, and an ad hoc procedure to address the scalability of the problem to larger instances is proposed.</description>

      <title>metasnf: Meta Clustering with Similarity Network Fusion in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: metasnf is an R package that enables users to apply meta clustering, a method for efficiently searching a broad space of cluster solutions by clustering the solutions themselves, to clustering workflows based on similarity network fusion (SNF). SNF is a multi-modal data integration algorithm commonly used for biomedical subtype discovery. The package also contains functions to assist with cluster visualization, characterization, and validation. This package can help researchers identify SNF-derived cluster solutions that are guided by context-specific utility over context-agnostic measures of quality.</description>

      <title>Improving Insurance Catastrophic Data with Resampling and GAN Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise and large dataset concerning catastrophic events is very important for insurers. To improve the quality of such data three methods based on the bootstrap, bootknife, and GAN algorithms are proposed. Using numerical experiments and real-life data, simulated outputs for these approaches are compared based on the mean squared (MSE) and mean absolute errors (MAE). Then, a direct algorithm to construct a fuzzy expert's opinion concerning such outputs is also considered.</description>

      <title>Stable generative modeling using Schr\"odinger bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. Such settings have recently drawn considerable interest in the context of generative modelling and Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a generative model combining Schr\"odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. Schr\"odinger bridges over an appropriate reversible reference process are used to approximate the conditional transition probability from the available training samples, which is then implemented in a discrete-time reversible Langevin sampler to generate new samples. By setting the kernel bandwidth in the reference process to match the time step size used in the unadjusted Langevin algorithm, our method effectively circumvents any stability issues typically associated with the time-stepping of stiff stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a novel split-step scheme, ensuring that the generated samples remain within the convex hull of the training samples. Our framework can be naturally extended to generate conditional samples and to Bayesian inference problems. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing dimensions and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem as well as generating sample trajectories of a dynamical system using conditional sampling.</description>

      <title>MM Algorithms for Statistical Estimation in Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantile regression is a robust and practically useful way to efficiently model quantile varying correlation and predict varied response quantiles of interest. This article constructs and tests MM algorithms, which are simple to code and have been suggested superior to some other prominent quantile regression methods in nonregularized problems, in an array of quantile regression settings including linear (modeling different quantile coefficients both separately and simultaneously), nonparametric, regularized, and monotone quantile regression. Applications to various real data sets and two simulation studies comparing MM to existing tested methods have corroborated our algorithms' effectiveness. We have made one key advance by generalizing our MM algorithm to efficiently fit easy-to-predict-and-interpret parametric quantile regression models for data sets exhibiting manifest complicated nonlinear correlation patterns, which has not yet been covered by current literature to the best of our knowledge.</description>
