      <title>Generation of spatiotemporal acoustic vortices with arbitrarily oriented orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive exploration of acoustic vortices carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), the generation of acoustic vortices with OAM orientations beyond the conventional longitudinal direction remains largely unexplored. Spatiotemporal (ST) vortices, featuring spiral phase twisting in the ST domain and carrying transverse OAM, have recently attracted considerable interest in optics and acoustics. Here, we report the generation of three-dimensional (3D) ST acoustic vortices with arbitrarily oriented OAM, thereby opening up a new dimension in acoustic OAM control. By utilizing a two-dimensional (2D) acoustic phased array, we introduce two approaches to manipulate the orientation of OAM: through the direct rotation of vortices in 3D space and the intersection of vortices carrying distinct types of OAM. These methods enable unprecedented control over the orientation of acoustic OAM, providing a new degree of freedom in the manipulation of acoustic waves. The arbitrarily oriented OAM holds promise for enhancing acoustic communication by broadening capacity and enabling more complex particle manipulation techniques. Our work establishes a foundation for future explorations into the complex dynamics of novel structured acoustic fields in the ST domain.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast (10 GHz) mid-IR modulator based on ultra-fast electrical switching of the light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a free-space amplitude modulator for mid-infrared radiation (lambda=9.6 um) that operates at room temperature up to at least 20 GHz (above the -3dB cutoff frequency measured at 8.2 GHz). The device relies on the ultra-fast transition between weak and strong-coupling regimes induced by the variation of the applied bias voltage. Such transition induces a modulation of the device reflectivity. It is made of a semiconductor heterostructure enclosed in a judiciously designed array of metal-metal optical resonators, that - all-together - behave as an electrically tunable surface. At negative bias, it operates in the weak light-matter coupling regime. Upon application of an appropriate positive bias, the quantum wells populate with electrons and the device transitions to the strong-coupling regime. The modulator transmission keeps linear with input RF power in the 0dBm - 9dBm range. The increase of optical powers up to 25 mW exhibit a weak beginning saturation a little bit below.</description>

      <title>Photosensitive PEEK Ink Enables Digital Light Processing 3D Printed High-performance Small Architected-Plastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), as a semi-crystalline high-performance engineering plastic, has demonstrated good application prospects since its introduction. The ability of PEEK to be fabricated in complex architecture is a major limitation due to the inherent shortcomings of material extrusion 3D printing technology in terms of low resolution, low surface quality, and interlayer bonding. We propose a novel PEEK ink processing process based on digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing, which is based on high solid content PEEK ink to achieve green bodies with high accuracy, and one-step sintering to enhance the crystallinity of PEEK. We have investigated the processing mechanism of this process and constructed perfect process parameters in terms of mouldability, printing accuracy, material thermal properties, and PEEK crystallinity. Furthermore, the material and architecture performance of the proposed process was evaluated in terms of comprehensive thermal performance (including heat resistance of the substrate, thermal stability, surface energy after heat treatment, and coefficient of static friction and coefficient of kinetic friction), mechanical performance, and corrosion resistance (20 wt% hydrochloric acid, 20 wt% sodium hydroxide, 99 wt% acetone, and 99.5 wt% chloroform). The process is a bold extension of PEEK processing methods to utilize the properties of PEEK in more flexible and efficient applications.</description>

      <title>Electron transporting bilayers for perovskite solar cells: spray coating deposition of c-TiO2/m-SnO2-quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein we present a comparative study among different mesoporous electron transporter layers (ETLs), namely nanometric m-TiO2, m-SnO2 and m-SnO2 quantum dots (QDs), deposited by spray coating method. The experimental data correlated with the photovoltaic parameters indicate that the SnO2 mesoporous layer obtained from the spray deposition of the in-house prepared QDs solution is the best candidate between the three used mesoporous ETLs. The use of the in-house prepared SnO2 QDs solution presents smaller agglomerates composed of 3 nm NPs resulting in the formation of a thinner, more uniform, and compact mesoporous ETL, compared with the other two ETL solutions. The formamidinium-methylamonium-potassium (FAMA@10K) perovskite deposited on this m-SnO2 QDs ETL presents a lower RMS, more uniformity and, a higher amount of PbI2. Interestingly, this higher concentration for PbI2 seems to enhance the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSC), compared to the other two mesoporous ETLs. Our work reveals that SnO2 QDs solution can be easily produced in the laboratory and it is more suited for the deposition of the mesoporous ETL when choosing a FAMA@10K configuration perovskite solar cell with power conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 10%.</description>

      <title>Transient States to Control the Electromagnetic Response of Space-time Dispersive Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamic formation of transients when plane waves impinge on a dispersive slab that abruptly changes its electrical properties in time. The time-varying slab alternates between air and metal-like states, whose frequency dispersion is described by the Drude model. It is shown how the physics of this complex system can be well described with the joint combination of two terms: one associated with temporal refractions and the other associated with spatial refractions. To test the validity of the approach, some analytical results are compared with a self-implemented finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Results show how the transients that occurred after the abrupt temporal changes can shape the overall steady-state response of the space-time system. In fact, far from always being detrimental, these transient states can be conveniently used to perform frequency conversion or to amplify/attenuate the electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>How to Achieve High Spatial Resolution in Organic Optobioelectronic Devices?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light activated local stimulation and sensing of biological cells offers enormous potential for minimally invasive bioelectronic interfaces. Organic semiconductors are a promising material class to achieve this kind of transduction due to their optoelectronic properties and biocompatibility. Here we investigate which material properties are necessary to keep the optical excitation localized. This is critical to single cell transduction with high spatial resolution. As a model system we use organic photocapacitors for cell stimulation made of the small molecule semiconductors H2Pc and PTCDI. We investigate the spatial broadening of the localized optical excitation with photovoltage microscopy measurements. Our experimental data combined with modelling show that resolution losses due to the broadening of the excitation are directly related to the effective diffusion length of charge carriers generated at the heterojunction. With additional transient photovoltage measurements we find that the H2Pc/PTCDI heterojunction offers a small diffusion length of lambda = 1.5 +/- 0.1 um due to the small mobility of charge carriers along the heterojunction. Instead covering the heterojunction with a layer of PEDOT:PSS improves the photocapacitor performance but increases the carrier diffusion length to lambda = 7.0 +/- 0.3 um due to longer lifetime and higher carrier mobility. Furthermore, we introduce electrochemical photocurrent microscopy experiments to demonstrate micrometric resolution with the pn-junction under realistic aqueous operation conditions. This work offers valuable insights into the physical mechanisms governing the excitation and transduction profile and provide design principles for future organic semiconductor junctions, aiming to achieve high efficiency and high spatial resolution.</description>

Abstract: Vibration attenuation has played a crucial role in engineering structure, wherein metamaterials have found escalated usage. These structures can be cleverly built to be lightweight and have negative mass properties, which can attenuate waves at specific frequency bands. The first part studies wave propagation in meta-beam with coupled acoustic black holes and local resonators, whereas the second part discusses multi-stable nonlinear oscillators in a 1D metamaterial chain.</description>

      <title>UV hybrid photon detector based on GaN photocathodes and Si low gain avalanche diode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon detectors featuring single-photon sensitivity play a crucial role in various scientific domains, including high-energy physics, astronomy, and quantum optics. Fast response time, high quantum efficiency, and minimal dark counts are the characteristics that render them ideal candidates for detecting individual photons with exceptional signal-to-noise ratios, at frequencies in the the range of hundreds of MHz. Here, we report on our first design and operational results on a Hybrid Photon Detector (HPD) that combines the high quantum efficiency of a Gallium Nitride (GaN) photocathode and the low noise characteristics of a Si-based Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD). This hybrid detection scheme has the potential to reach single-photon detection sensitivity with high quantum efficiency, low noise levels and capable of operating at hundreds of MHz repetition rates.</description>

      <title>Microscopic characteristics of SF6 partial discharge induced by a floating linear metal particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct current (DC) gas insulated transmission lines (GILs) have been widely used in power transmission, but might be threatened by partial discharge due to the presence of floating impurities (e.g., dust and metal particles) inside the sealed chamber. In this letter, by using a 2D fluid model we characterize the microscopic properties of the partial discharge induced by a floating linear metal particle in SF6 (both the discharge propagation and interaction between space charge and metal particle) under negative high voltage direct current (HVDC) conditions. Due to the strong electronegativity of SF6, the spatiotemporal distributions of the charged species (electrons, positive and negative ions), space charge, and reduced electric field are rather different from those in air. Notably, a negative ion region is observed around the top tip of the metal particle, and it plays an important role in the generation and propagation of primary and secondary streamers in SF6, which may lead to severe motion characteristics of the particle and aliasing of partial discharge signals. Additionally, we analyze the charging process and electric force reversal phenomenon, which may provide a more precise understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the firefly motion previously reported for DC GILs.</description>

      <title>THz probing of non-trivial topological states in Co2MnGe Heusler alloy thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Co2MnGe (CMG) has been demonstrated recently as a half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloy which possesses a topologically non-trivial band structure. This behavior is unique to such systems and hence warrants extensive experimental exploration for potential spintronic and chirality sensitive optoelectonic applications. Here, we demonstrate that an epitaxial thin film of CMG acts as a source of THz radiation upon photoexcitation by optical femtosecond laser pulses. Detailed experiments have revealed that a large contribution to THz emission occurs due to nonmagnetic or spin-independent origin, however, significant contribution in the THz generation is evidenced through excitation light helicity dependent circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) confirming the presence of topologically non-trivial carriers. Furthermore, we show that not only the topological contribution is easily suppressed but also the overall THz generation efficiency is also affected adversely for the epitaxial films grown at high substrate temperatures.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic resonance response in square artificial spin ice: roles of geometry in vertex dynamics and magnetic configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.</description>
