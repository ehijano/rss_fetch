      <title>Universal Turbulent States of Miscible Two-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate turbulence in miscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a box potential using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Turbulence is driven by an oscillating force, causing the components to oscillate either in-phase (co-oscillating) or out-of-phase (counter-oscillating). A parameter measuring component separation (0 for overlap, 1 for full separation) reveals two turbulent states: coupled (the parameter $\sim0$) and decoupled (the parameter $\sim0.5$). Co-oscillating flows transition between these states at a critical interaction strength, while counter-oscillating flows consistently show the decoupled state. A probabilistic model predicts the decoupled state's parameter as $\sqrt{4/\pi - 1} = 0.523$, consistent with simulations.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering hypervolume of two-component fermions in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero-energy collision of three fermions, two of which are in the spin-down ($\downarrow$) state and one of which is in the spin-up ($\uparrow$) state. Assuming that the two-body and the three-body interactions have a finite range, we find a parameter, $D$, called the three-body scattering hypervolume. We study the three-body wave function asymptotically when three fermions are far apart or one spin-$\uparrow$ (spin-$\downarrow$) fermion and one pair, formed by the other two fermions, are far apart, and derive three asymptotic expansions of the wave function. The three-body scattering hypervolume appears in the coefficients of such expansions at the order of $B^{-5}$, where $B$ is the hyperradius of the triangle formed by the three fermions. When the interactions are weak, we calculate $D$ approximately using the Born expansion. We also analyze the energy shift of three such fermions in a large periodic cube due to $D$ and generalize this result to the many-fermion system. $D$ also determines the three-body recombination rate in two-component Fermi gases, and we calculate the three-body recombination rate in terms of $D$ and the density and temperature of the gas.</description>

      <title>Two- and many-body physics of ultracold molecules dressed by dual microwave fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two- and many-body physics of the ultracold polar molecules dressed by dual microwaves with distinct polarizations. Using Floquet theory and multichannel scattering calculations, we identify a regime with the largest elastic-to-inelastic scattering ratio which is favorable for performing evaporative cooling. Furthermore, we derive and, subsequently, validate an effective interaction potential that accurately captures the dynamics of microwave-shielded polar molecules (MSPMs). We also explore the ground-state properties of the ultracold gases of MSPMs by computing physical quantities such as gas density, condensate fraction, momentum distribution, and second-order correlation. It is shown that the system supports a weakly correlated expanding gas state and a strongly correlated self-bound gas state. Since the dual-microwave scheme introduces addition control knob and is essential for creating ultracold Bose gases of polar molecules, our work pave the way for studying two- and many-body physics of the ultracold polar molecules dressed by dual microwaves.</description>

      <title>Dipolar magnetostirring protocol for three-well atomtronic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a magnetostirring protocol to create persistent currents on an annular system. Under this protocol, polar bosons confined in a three-well ring circuit reach a state with high average circulation. We model the system with an extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian and show that the protocol can create circulation in an atomtronic circuit for a range of tunable parameters. The performance and robustness of this scheme are examined, in particular considering different interaction regimes. We also present a method for predicting the optimal protocol parameters, which improves protocol's scalability and enables its application to systems with large numbers of bosons. This overcomes computational limitations and paves the way for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermiticity enhanced topological immunity of one-dimensional $p$-wave superconducting chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the immunity of topological superconductors against non-local disorder is one of the key issues in both fundamental researches and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate that the non-Hermiticity can enhance the robustness of topological edge states against non-local disorder. To illustrate that, we consider a one-dimensional (1D) generalized Kitaev model with the asymmetric hopping in the presence of disorder. It is shown that the region supporting Majorana zero modes (MZMs) against non-local disorder will be enlarged by the non-Hermiticity. Through both the numerical and analytical analyses, we show that non-Hermiticity can stabilize the topological superconducting (SC) phase against higher disorder strength. Our studies would offer new insights into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose--Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schr\"odinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Realizing multiband states with ultracold dipolar quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manipulation of dipolar interactions within ultracold molecular ensembles represents a pivotal advancement in experimental physics, aiming at the emulation of quantum phenomena unattainable through mere contact interactions. Our study uncovers regimes of multiband occupation which allow to probe more realistic, complex long-range interacting lattice models with ultracold dipolar simulators. By mapping out experimentally relevant ranges of potential depths, interaction strengths, particle fillings, and geometric configurations, we calculate the agreement between the state prepared in the quantum simulator and a target lattice state. We do so by separately calculating numerically exact many-body wave functions in the continuum and single- or multiband lattice representations, and building their many-body state overlaps. Our findings reveal that for shallow lattices and stronger interactions above half filling, multiband population increases, resulting in fundamentally different ground states than the ones observed in simple lowest-band descriptions, e.g. striped vs checkerboard states. A wide range of probed parameter regimes in its turn provides a systematic and quantitative blueprint for realizing multiband states with two-dimensional quantum simulators employing ultracold dipolar molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices and tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range from a millisecond to a second, significantly limiting the cycle time. In this work, we present fast, 2.4 microseconds single-atom imaging in lattices, with 99.4% fidelity - pushing the readout duration of neutral atom quantum platforms to be close to that of superconducting qubit platforms. Additionally, we thoroughly study the performance of accordion lattices. We also demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum link models.</description>

      <title>Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation for repulsive-to-attractive interaction quench in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 &lt; \alpha &lt;4.0$). We investigate exotic dynamics when the interactions are suddenly switched from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive, a procedure known to generate super-Tonks-Girardeau gases in systems with contact interactions. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the relaxed state exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the coherent (quantum) gas and the chaotic (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting analogous results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce a slower initial entropy growth. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard way to generate many-body quantum correlations is via a dynamical protocol: an initial product state is transformed by interactions that generate non-classical correlations at later times. Here, we show that many-body Bell correlations are inherently present in the eigenstates of a variety of spin-1/2 chains. In particular, we show that the eigenstates and thermal states of the collective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model possess many-body Bell correlations. We demonstrate that the Bell correlations can take on quantized values that change discontinuously with variations in the total magnetization. Finally, we show that these many-body Bell correlations persist even in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder.</description>
