      <title>Quantization and quantum oscillations of the sublattice charge order in Dirac insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the quantization, quantum oscillations, and singular behavior of sublattice symmetry-breaking sublattice charge order (SCO) in two-dimensional Dirac insulators at charge neutrality under perpendicular magnetic fields $B$. SCO is induced by staggered sublattice potentials, such as those originating from substrates, strains, hydrogenation, and chemical doping. In small non-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum threading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO exhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\sim |B|$, originating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice. At intermediate magnetic fields, when the cyclotron gap between the zeroth Landau level and the first Landau level, $\omega_c$, is smaller than the sublattice potential, $\omega_c\lesssim \Delta$, SCO shows $\textit{universally}$ quantized plateaus owing to discrete Landau-level degeneracy. As the magnetic flux increases by one flux quantum, one electron (per spin) is transferred from the sublattice with a higher chemical potential to the sublattice with a lower chemical potential. One electron transfer between sublattices per flux quantum results from the sublattice polarization of the zeroth Landau level in gapped Dirac materials, realizing the topological Thouless pump effect. At stronger magnetic fields, $\omega_c\gtrsim \ \Delta$, corresponding to integer quantum Hall regimes, SCO displays singularities based on the physics of quantum magneto-oscillations. Our findings suggest new ways to experimentally detect the presence of the energy gap in Dirac materials, irrespective of the gap size.</description>

      <title>Emergent gapless spiral phases and conformal Lifshitz criticality in the cluster Ising model with off-diagonal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analytical study of the exotic quantum phases and phase transitions emerging from the cluster-Ising model with off-diagonal Gamma interactions. Specifically, we map out the ground-state phase diagram by analyzing both local and nonlocal order parameters, together with the energy spectra. The results reveal two pairs of gapped phases, namely and antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phases, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, as well as two distinct gapless spiral phases induced by the off-diagonal interactions, which are related by a duality transformation and are numerically confirmed through the long-distance behavior of various order parameters. Remarkably, four distinct phase transition lines emerge in the phase diagram. Two of them, which separate the distinct gapped or gapless phases, are described by the Ising and three copy Ising conformal field theories, respectively. In contrast, the remaining two transition lines, between the gapless spiral and gapped phases, belong to a nonconformal Lifshitz criticality with dynamical critical exponent $z = 2$. More importantly, the intersection of these four transition lines gives rise to a new Lifshitz multicritical point exhibiting emergent conformal symmetry, marking a fundamental departure from all previously known nonconformal Lifshitz points. This work provides a valuable reference for future investigations of exotic gapless phases and their transitions in exactly solvable many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.</description>

      <title>Breathing-Driven Metal-Insulator Transition in Correlated Kagome Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent discovery of breathing kagome materials \(\rm Nb_3Cl_8\) and \(\rm Nb_3TeCl_7\), we have explored the influence of the breathing effect on the Hubbard model of the kagome lattice. Utilizing the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we first investigated the average sign problem in the breathing kagome lattice, which is significantly affected by both the breathing strength and the interaction strength. Secondly, we calculated the electronic kinetic energy, the direct current conductivity, and the electronic density of states at the Fermi level to determine the critical interaction strength for the metal-insulator transition. Our results indicate that the breathing effect, in conjunction with the interaction strength, drives the kagome system from a metal to an insulator. Finally, we evaluated the magnetic properties and constructed a phase diagram incorporating both transport and magnetic properties. The phase diagram reveals that as the interaction strength increases, the system transitions from a paramagnetic metal to a Mott insulator. Our research provides a theoretical guidance for utilizing the breathing effect to control the band gaps, conductivity, and magnetic properties of kagome materials with electronic interactions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of the kagome metal YbFe6Ge6 in view of Bragg diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A material in possession of localized 4f-electron magnetism and delocalized 3d-electron or band magnetism can often present enigmatic physical phenomena, and there has been a longstanding interest in the kagome metal YbFe6Ge6. More recently, because of an investigation of a so-called anomalous Hall effect, or topological Hall effect, underpinned by a thorough study of its magnetic structures using neutron diffraction and single crystals [W. Yao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 186501 (2025)]. The authors endorse a magnetic structure of Fe ions in the low temperature phase originally mis-reported in their diffraction patterns. The orthorhombic magnetic space group inferred from the endorsed structure is P(parity)T(time)-symmetric (anti-inversion (-1') a linear magneto-electric, like an altermagnet. Calculated Bragg diffraction patterns for future x-ray and neutron experiments are rich in Fe magnetic properties of orthorhombic YbFe6Ge6, including space-spin correlations, anapoles and Dirac quadrupoles familiar in high-Tc ceramic superconductors. Iron moments in the two-dimensional layers of a hexagonal nuclear structure undergo collinear antiferromagnetic order below a temperature = 500 K. The moments depart from the c axis in a spontaneous transition at = 63 K to an orthorhombic structure. The magnetism of Yb ions appears to behave independently, which can be confirmed using resonant x-ray diffraction enhanced by an Fe atomic resonance.</description>

      <title>Spin Dynamics and Light-Induced Effects in EuZn$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic spin dynamics and optical properties of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ are studied. Single crystals grown by the Sn-flux method crystallize in the $P\overline{3}m1$ (No.~164) space group and order antiferromagnetically at $T_N=23.5$~K. $^{151}$Eu M\"ossbauer spectroscopy confirms the presence of the Eu$^{2+}$ oxidation state only and the magnetic moment angle relative to the $c$-axis is $\theta=46(3)$\textdegree. Temperature-dependent electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements reveal that spin-spin interactions predominantly govern the spin relaxation mechanisms, as evidenced by the linewidth behavior ($\Delta H$). Positive $g$-shifts ($\Delta g)$ for $H \parallel ab$ indicate the presence of local electron polarization. The ESR data support the formation of anisotropic magnetic polarons, which trap spin carriers and contribute to increased electrical resistance. Angular-dependent ESR spectra at room temperature display anisotropic behavior in both $\Delta g(\phi)$ and $\Delta H(\phi)$, with a dominant three-dimensional component $C_{3D}$, indicative of robust interlayer coupling and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Under light illumination, a small broadening of $\Delta H$ is observed. Furthermore, a photovoltaic effect is identified in EuZn$_2$P$_2$, with photodetector performance metrics suggesting promising capabilities for future optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries Phase Transitions with Local Quantum Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries are important guiding principle for phase transitions. We systematically construct field theory models with local quantum fields that exhibit the following phase transitions: (1) different symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with generalized symmetries; (2) different symmetry enriched topological (SET) phases with generalized symmetries differ by symmetry fractionalizations; (3) spontaneously broken generalized symmetries, where the unbroken phases can have nontrivial SPT or SET. The models are ordinary gauge theories with bosons or fermions in 3+1d and 2+1d. We focus on one-form symmetries and symmetries generated by condensation defects, which do not act on local operators. The phase transitions are protected from local operator perturbations which do not change the asymptotic phases. In particular, we show that continuous gauge theories in 3+1d can have different phases distinguished by fractionalizations of unbroken one-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Pairing in Bilayer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of $T_c\sim 80$~K superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has launched a new platform to study high-temperature superconductivity. Using non-perturbative dynamic cluster approximation quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we characterize the magnetic and superconducting pairing behavior of a realistic bilayer two-orbital Hubbard-Hund model of this system that describes the relevant Ni $e_g$ states with physically relevant interaction strengths. We find a leading $s^\pm$ superconducting instability in this model and show that this state primarily arises from interlayer pairing in the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital that is driven by strong interlayer spin-fluctuations in that orbital. These results provide non-perturbative evidence supporting the picture that a simple single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model for the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital provides an excellent low-energy effective description of the superconducting behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Linear-response theory in Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium quantum physics greatly simplifies in the case of time-periodic Hamiltonians, since Floquet theory provides an analogue to Bloch's theorem in the time domain. Still, the formal properties of Floquet many-body theory remain underexplored. Here, we develop linear response theory for Floquet systems, in the sense that we have a time-periodic potential of arbitrary strength and a perturbatively small but non-periodic probing field. As an application, we derive the analogy of Fermi's Golden Rule and the photoemission spectrum of a many-electron system. As in the equilibrium case, the latter is related to the spectral function which is positive definite. We also analyze the parameter dependence of the controllable photoemission spectra by virtue of Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Landau theory of the density wave transition in trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Landau treatment of the incommensurate density wave transition observed in trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates and uses this to address the nature of the transition. The data are consistent with a spin driven transition with the distinct intertwining of charge and spin order due to being in or proximate to the first order transition region of the Landau phase diagram. From this approach, one also obtains an understanding of the variation of the transition temperature with rare earth size, pressure, and oxygen isotope substitution.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and transport in materials with flat bands: 2D materials and quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present our recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are always the signature of an electronic confinement. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms) and are very sensitive to small structural distortions such as "heterostrain". Their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In twisted bilayer graphene, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on 2D nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result, which seems to be confirmed by very recent experimental measurements, suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and energy eigenstates of a spin-1/2 coupled trimer, tetramer in a star configuration, and tetrahedron. Using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with additional Kitaev interactions, we explore the thermodynamic signatures of the Kitaev interaction. Our results show that introducing a Kitaev interaction generates a second Schottky anomaly in the heat capacity for systems with a large K/J ratio. The Kitaev term also introduces nonlinear eigenvalues with respect to a magnetic field, pushing the clusters toward a regime similar to the incomplete Paschen-Back effect and triggering first and second-order quantum phase transitions along with robust thermodynamic behavior. Through this approach, we provide exact analytical solutions that offer insights into Kitaev interactions, both in molecular magnets and in extended systems such as honeycomb or Kagome lattices. Furthermore, we provide insight into experimental measurements for detecting Kitaev interactions in clusters.</description>

      <title>All-optical control of antiferromagnetic domains via an inverse optical magnetoelectric effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are a promising platform for next-generation spintronics due to their ultrafast spin dynamics and robustness to external fields. All-optical control of antiferromagnetic order is essential to fully exploit their potential in energy-efficient and high-speed spintronic and memory applications. However, optical writing of antiferromagnetic domains remains a fundamental challenge, as conventional magneto-optical techniques rely on net magnetization, which is absent in antiferromagnets. In certain multiferroic antiferromagnets, the magnetic toroidal moment provides an additional degree of freedom through its inherent magnetoelectric coupling. This coupling at higher frequencies results in the optical magnetoelectric effect (OME), which manifests as a directional asymmetry in light propagation and enables optical probing of antiferromagnetic states. Here, we demonstrate all-optical writing of antiferromagnetic domains using the inverse optical magnetoelectric effect (IOME) in ferrotoroidic LiNiPO4. The writing process is nonvolatile, non-thermal, and deterministic, driven solely by reversing the light propagation direction. This directional control arises from a strong coupling between the photon linear momentum and the magnetic toroidal moment, enabling the repeatable switching between time-reversed domains with arbitrary light polarization. Our findings establish IOME as a distinct mechanism for manipulating antiferromagnetic order, opening a new paradigm in opto-magnetism driven by photon momentum.</description>

      <title>Disorder and the Robustness of Superconductivity on the Flat Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07302v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the need to understand and determine the presence of non-trivial superconductivity in real candidate materials, we present a generalized set of self-consistent Gor'kov-Hedin equations in a vibrating lattice with spin dependent electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. This extends Hedin's original equations to treat quantum many-body systems where electronic and lattice correlations along with relativistic effects coexist on the same footing. Upon iterating this set of equations, the corresponding spin-dependent GW approximation and generalized ladder approximations are constructed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical learning and quantum memory with non-Hermitian many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems provide a fertile platform for quantum technologies, owing in part to their distinct dynamical phases. These systems can be characterized by the preservation or spontaneous breaking of parity-time reversal symmetry, significantly impacting the dynamical behavior of quantum resources such as entanglement and purity; resources which in turn govern the system's information processing and memory capacity. Here we investigate this relationship using the example of an interacting NH spin system defined on random graphs. We show that the onset of the first exceptional point - marking the real-to-complex spectral transition - also corresponds to an abrupt change in the system's learning capacity. We further demonstrate that this transition is controllable via local disorder and spin interactions strength, thereby defining a tunable learnability threshold. Within the learning phase, the system exhibits the key features required for memory-dependent reservoir computing. This makes explicit a direct link between spectral structure and computational capacity, further establishing non-Hermiticity, and more broadly engineered dissipation, as a dynamic resource for temporal quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Unconventional S-orbital state of Tb and cooperative Ru(4d)-Tb(4f) spin-ordering in strongly correlated 4d-4f system, Ba3TbRu2O9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 6H-perovskite Ba3RRu2O9 (R = rare-earth), composed of Ru2O9 dimers connected through RO6 octahedra, exhibits an intriguing variety of magnetic ground states, ranging from non-magnetic to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, depending on the specific R ion. In this study, we investigate the compound Ba3TbRu2O9 using magnetic susceptibility measurements and time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiments. Our combined bulk and microscopic analyses reveal that the Tb4+ (4f7) electronic configuration results in an s-like state with an orbital moment L=0 and spin-only value of S=7/2, and Ru4+ exhibits a spin-only value of S=1 despite the presence of strong spin-lattice coupling in this compound, representing a sharp contrast to other reported members of this family. A cooperative 4d-4f spin ordering is observed below the Neel temperature (around 9.5 K), indicating strong Ru(4d)=Tb(4f) correlations in the system. The Tb-moments order antiferromagnetically in the bc-plane, whereas the Ru-moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along the b-axis. Furthermore, a collinear antiferromagnetic arrangement of spins is observed within the Ru2O9 dimers throughout the structure, unlike other reported members of this series (e.g., Ho and Nd).</description>

Abstract: Physical and chemical systems can be characterized by their natural frequency and energy scales. It is hardly an exaggeration that most of what we know about such systems, from the acoustics of a violin to the energy levels of atoms, comes from their response to perturbations at these natural frequencies. It is of course the same situation in `correlated' electron materials. We can learn about the novel effects of strong electron-electron interactions and the properties of collective states of matter (superconductors, quantum magnets etc.) by characterizing their response to small amplitude perturbations at their natural frequencies. In solids, these natural frequency scales span an impressively large frequency range from x-ray down to DC. This incredibly broad range means that a blizzard of experimental techniques and analysis methods are required for the characterization of correlated systems with optical techniques. This short review and lecture notes attempt to lay out a brief summary of the formalism, techniques, and analysis used for `optical' spectroscopies of correlated electron systems. They are idiosyncratic, occasionally opinionated, and - considering the breadth of the subject - incredibly brief.</description>

Abstract: A central problem in modern condensed matter physics is the understanding of materials with strong electron correlations. Despite extensive work, the essential physics of many of these systems is not understood and there is very little ability to make predictions in this class of materials. In this manuscript we share our personal views on the major open problems in the field of correlated electron systems. We discuss some possible routes to make progress in this rich and fascinating field. This manuscript is the result of the vigorous discussions and deliberations that took place at Johns Hopkins University during a three-day workshop January 27, 28, and 29, 2020 that brought together six senior scientists and 46 more junior scientists. Our hope, is that the topics we have presented will provide inspiration for others working in this field and motivation for the idea that significant progress can be made on very hard problems if we focus our collective energies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

Abstract: The deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has become a central open concept in the physics of quantum matter, and its proposed presence in the Shastry-Sutherland model was followed by the experimental observation of at least a minimal DQC scenario induced by an applied magnetic field in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. However, the nature of the plaquette-singlet phase in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ remains unresolved, and with it the identification of the DQCP symmetry from among several theoretical scenarios. Here we perform detailed high-pressure $^{11}$B NMR studies to reveal the presence of both the full-plaquette (FP) and empty-plaquette (EP) phases in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, phase-separated at a first-order, pressure-driven transition with a volume-fraction effect. The field-driven transition from the EP to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase complements our previous observations of the FP--AFM transition, with both showing deconfined quantum criticality, while the scaling of the spin-lattice relaxation rate near the EP--AFM transition, $1/T_1 \propto T^{0.6}$, suggests a DQCP governed by a different universality class. We discuss possible extensions to the Shastry-Sutherland model that account for these pressure and field effects. The expanded phase space we discover mandates an SO(5) DQCP symmetry, and hence our results take an important step towards a complete understanding of deconfined quantum criticality in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.</description>

Abstract: The recent experimental observation of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effects in the rhombohedrally stacked pentalayer graphene has motivated theoretical discussions on the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC), a topological version of Wigner crystal. Conventional topological Wigner crystals typically have one electron per unit cell. In this work we propose new types of topological Wigner crystals labeled as QAHC-$z$, with $z$ electrons per unit cell. In the pentalayer graphene system, we find parameter regimes where QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 have lower energy than the conventional QAHC-1 at total filling $\nu=1$ per moir\'e unit cell. These states all have total Chern number $C_\mathrm{tot}=1$ and are consistent with the QAH effect observed in the experiments. The larger period QAHC states have lower kinetic energy due to the unique Mexican-hat dispersion of the pentalayer graphene, which can compensate for the loss in the interaction energy. Unlike QAHC-1, QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 break the moir\'e translation symmetry and are sharply distinct from a moir\'e band insulator. We also briefly discuss the competition between integer QAH and fractional QAH states at filling $\nu=2/3$. Moreover, we find that a stronger moir\'e potential can significantly change the phase diagram and even favors a QAHC-1 ansatz with $C=2$ Chern band.</description>

Abstract: A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N &gt;2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.</description>

      <title>Discovery of magnetic-field-tunable density waves in a layered altermagnet</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets recently came into the spotlight as a new class of magnetic materials, arising as a consequence of specific crystal symmetries. They are characterized by a spin-polarized electronic band structure similar to ferromagnets, but with net zero magnetization, and touted as a promising platform to host a slew of exotic properties, many of which are yet to be explored. Here we study a new layered triangular lattice altermagnet, Co-intercalated NbSe$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). Differential conductance dI/dV spectra at low temperature reveal a surprising partial gap opening centered at the Fermi level, which is not captured by density functional theory calculations of the system in the pure altermagnetic state. Spatial mapping using spectroscopic-imaging STM and spin-polarized STM further reveals emergent tri-directional charge and spin density modulations with a 2a$_0$ wave length. Interestingly, we discover that out-of-plane magnetic field can serve as a knob to tune the amplitudes of the modulations as well as alter the overall electronic density-of-states in a manner that is strongly dependent on the field direction and strength. This can be attributed to the tilting of spins by the external magnetic field, which can have profound implications on the electronic properties of the altermagnet. By providing elusive atomic-scale insights, our work uncovers a tunable density wave accompanied by concomitant changes in the electronic band structure, and sets the foundation for studies of correlated electronic phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order. Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison, conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.</description>

      <title>A many-body marker for three-dimensional topological insulators with inversion symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the previously defined many-body marker for two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators [I. Gilardoni {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, L161106 (2022)] to distinguish trivial, weak-, and strong-topological insulators in three dimensions, in presence of the inversion symmetry. The marker is written in term of ground-state expectation values of position operators and can be employed to detect topological phases of interacting systems beyond mean-field approximations, e.g., within quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Here, we show that the correct results of the non-interacting limit are reproduced by the many-body marker.</description>

      <title>Time-linear quantum transport simulations with correlated nonequilibrium Green's functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-linear scaling method to simulate open and correlated quantum systems out of equilibrium. The method inherits from many-body perturbation theory the possibility to choose selectively the most relevant scattering processes in the dynamics, thereby paving the way to the real-time characterization of correlated ultrafast phenomena in quantum transport. The open system dynamics is described in terms of an embedding correlator from which the time-dependent current can be calculated using the Meir-Wingreen formula. We show how to efficiently implement our approach through a simple grafting into recently proposed time-linear Green's function methods for closed systems. Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions can be treated on equal footing while preserving all fundametal conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Role of bias and tunneling asymmetries in nonlinear Fermi-liquid transport through an SU($N$) quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01162v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how bias and tunneling asymmetries affect nonlinear current through a quantum dot with $N$ discrete levels in the Fermi liquid regime, using an exact low-energy expansion of the current derived up to terms of order $V^3$ with respect to the bias voltage. The expansion coefficients are described in terms of the phase shift, the linear susceptibilities, and the three-body correlation functions, defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state of the Anderson impurity model. In particular, the three-body correlations play an essential role in the order $V^3$ term, and their coupling to the nonlinear current depends crucially on the bias and tunnel asymmetries. The number of independent components of the three-body correlation functions increases with $N$ the internal degrees of the quantum dots, and it gives a variety in the low-energy transport. We calculate the correlation functions over a wide range of electron fillings of the Anderson impurity model with the SU($N$) internal symmetry, using the numerical renormalization group. We find that the order $V^3$ nonlinear current through the SU($N$) Kondo state, which occurs at electron fillings of $1$ and $N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions, significantly varies with the three-body contributions as tunnel asymmetries increase. Furthermore, in the valence fluctuation regime toward the empty or fully occupied impurity state, a sharp peak emerges in the coefficient of $V^3$ current in the case at which bias and tunneling asymmetries cooperatively enhance the charge transfer from one of the electrodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute to enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles that are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence, and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first-order, second-order, topological, and localization phase transitions, have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum-enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter that can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

      <title>Imprinting electrically switchable scalar spin chirality by anisotropic strain in a Kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological chiral antiferromagnets, such as Mn$_{3}$Sn, are emerging as promising materials for next-generation spintronic devices due to their intrinsic transport properties linked to exotic magnetic configurations. Here, we demonstrate that anisotropic strain in Mn$_{3}$Sn thin films offers a novel approach to manipulate the magnetic ground state, unlocking new functionalities in this material. Anisotropic strain reduces the point group symmetry of the manganese (Mn) Kagome triangles from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{1}$, significantly altering the energy landscape of the magnetic states in Mn$_{3}$Sn. This symmetry reduction enables even a tiny in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction to induce canting of the Mn spins out of the Kagome plane. The modified magnetic ground state introduces a finite scalar spin chirality and results in a significant Berry phase in momentum space. Consequently, a large anomalous Hall effect emerges in the Kagome plane at room temperature - an effect that is absent in the bulk material. Moreover, this two-fold degenerate magnetic state enables the creation of multiple-stable, non-volatile anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) memory states. These states are field-stable and can be controlled by thermal assisted current-induced magnetization switching requiring modest current densities and small bias fields, thereby offering a compelling new functionality in Mn$_{3}$Sn for spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum acoustic framework has recently emerged as a non-perturbative, coherent approach to electron-lattice interactions, uncovering rich physics often obscured by perturbative methods with incoherent scattering events. Here, we model the strongly coupled dynamics of electrons and acoustic lattice vibrations within this framework, representing lattice vibrations as coherent states and electrons as quantum wavepackets, in a manner distinctively different from tight-binding or discrete hopping-based approaches. We derive and numerically implement electron backaction on the lattice, providing both visual and quantitative insights into electron wavepacket evolution and the formation of acoustic polarons. We investigate polaron binding energies across varying material parameters and compute key observables, including mean square displacement, kinetic energy, potential energy, and vibrational energy. over time. Our findings reveal the conditions that favor polaron formation, which is enhanced by low temperatures, high deformation potential constants, slow sound velocities, and high effective masses. Additionally, we explore the impact of external electric and magnetic fields, showing that while polaron formation remains robust under moderate fields, it is weakly suppressed at higher field strengths. These results deepen our understanding of polaron dynamics and pave the way for future studies into non-trivial transport behavior in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fermi-Hubbard model ground-state preparation by coupling to a classical reservoir in the instantaneous-response limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing the ground state of the Fermi-Hubbard model is challenging, in part due to the exponentially large Hilbert space, which complicates efficiently finding a path from an initial state to the ground state using the variational principle. In this work, we propose an approach for ground state preparation of interacting models by involving a classical reservoir, simplified to the instantaneous-response limit, which can be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. The resulting time evolution operator consist of spin-adapted nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interaction terms similar to those in the Hubbard model, without expanding the Hilbert space. We can engineer the coupling to rapidly drive the system from an initial product state to its interacting ground state by numerically minimizing the final state energy. This ansatz closely resembles the Hamiltonian variational ansatz, offering a fresh perspective on it.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting quantum interference of charge carriers, epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide emerges as a game-changing platform for ultra-sensitive bolometric sensing, featuring an intrinsic resistive thermometer response unmatched by any other graphene variant. By achieving low and uniform carrier densities, we have accessed a new regime of strong charge localization that dramatically reduces thermal conductance, significantly enhancing bolometer performance. Here we present scalable graphene-based bolometers engineered for detecting GHz-range photons, a frequency domain essential for superconducting quantum processors. Our devices deliver a state-of-the-art noise equivalent power of 40 zW$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at $T=40~$mK, enabled by the steep temperature dependence of thermal conductance, $G_{\rm th}\sim T^4$ for $T&lt;100~$mK. These results establish epitaxial graphene bolometers as versatile and low-back-action detectors, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation quantum processors and pioneering investigations into the thermodynamics and thermalization pathways of strongly entangled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconducting Pairing Symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: from the Perspective of Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</description>

Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Strongly Correlated Transport in Topological Y-Junction Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I study electron transport through a Y-shaped junction of helical edge states in a two-dimensional topological insulator (2DTI), focusing on the strongly interacting regime. An experimentally accessible device geometry is proposed, and the corresponding conductance tensor is calculated. These results position Y-junctions of 2DTI as promising platforms for interaction-driven transport and nanoscale device applications in spintronics and topological electronics.</description>
