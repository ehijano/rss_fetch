      <title>Long-range dispersal promotes spatial synchrony but reduces the length and time scales of synchronous fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronous oscillations of spatially disjunct populations are widely observed in ecology. Even in the absence of spatially synchronized exogenous forces, metapopulations may synchronize via dispersal. For many species, most dispersal is local, but rare long-distance dispersal events also occur. While even small amounts of long-range dispersal are known to be important for processes like invasion and spatial spread rates, their potential influence on population synchrony is often overlooked, since local dispersal on its own can be strongly synchronizing. In this work, we investigate the effect of random, rare, long-range dispersal on the spatial synchrony of a metapopulation and find profound effects not only on synchrony but also on properties of the resulting spatial patterns. While controlling for the overall amount of emigration from each local subpopulation, we vary the fraction of dispersal that occurs locally (to nearest neighbors) versus globally (to random locations, irrespective of distance). Using a metric that measures the instantaneous level of global synchrony, we show that this form of long-range dispersal significantly favors the spatially synchronous state and homogenizes the population by decreasing the size of clusters of subpopulations that are out of phase with the rest of the metapopulation. Moreover, the addition of non-local dispersal significantly decreases the equilibration time of the metapopulation.</description>

      <title>Metaconcepts of rooted tree balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measures of tree balance play an important role in many different research areas such as mathematical phylogenetics or theoretical computer science. Typically, tree balance is quantified by a single number which is assigned to the tree by a balance or imbalance index, of which several exist in the literature. Most of these indices are based on structural aspects of tree shape, such as clade sizes or leaf depths. For instance, indices like the Sackin index, total cophenetic index, and $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic all quantify tree balance through clade sizes, albeit with different definitions and properties.
  In this paper, we formalize the idea that many tree (im)balance indices are functions of similar underlying tree shape characteristics by introducing metaconcepts of tree balance. A metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on a function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape, such as balance values, clade sizes, or leaf depths. These metaconcepts encompass existing indices but also provide new means of measuring tree balance. The versatility and generality of metaconcepts allow for the systematic study of entire families of (im)balance indices, providing deeper insights that extend beyond index-by-index analysis.</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of pairs of binary phylogenetic trees with identical $A_k$-alignments</title>

Abstract: Phylogenetic trees play a key role in the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. Typically, they are derived from aligned sequence data (like DNA, RNA, or proteins) by using optimization criteria like, e.g., maximum parsimony (MP). It is believed that the latter is able to reconstruct the \enquote{true} tree, i.e., the tree that generated the data, whenever the number of substitutions required to explain the data with that tree is relatively small compared to the size of the tree (measured in the number $n$ of leaves of the tree, which represent the species under investigation). However, reconstructing the correct tree from any alignment first and foremost requires the given alignment to perform differently on the \enquote{correct} tree than on others.
  A special type of alignments, namely so-called $A_k$-alignments, has gained considerable interest in recent literature. These alignments consist of all binary characters (\enquote{sites}) which require precisely $k$ substitutions on a given tree. It has been found that whenever $k$ is small enough (in comparison to $n$), $A_k$-alignments uniquely characterize the trees that generated them. However, recent literature has left a significant gap between $n\leq 2k+2$ -- namely the cases in which no such characterization is possible -- and $n\geq 4k$ -- namely the cases in which this characterization works. It is the main aim of the present manuscript to close this gap, i.e., to present a full characterization of all pairs of trees that share the same $A_k$-alignment. In particular, we show that indeed every binary phylogenetic tree with $n$ leaves is uniquely defined by its $A_k$-alignments if $n\geq 2k+3$. By closing said gap, we also ensure that our result is optimal.</description>

      <title>Reducing Size Bias in Epidemic Network Modelling</title>

Abstract: Epidemiological models help policymakers mitigate disease spread by predicting transmission metrics based on disease dynamics and contact networks. Calibrating these models requires representative network sampling. We investigate the Random Walk (RW) and Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW) algorithms for three network types: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER), Small-world (SW), and Scale-free (SF). Disease transmission is simulated using a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework. For ER and SW networks, RW overestimates infected individuals and secondary infections by $25\%$ due to size bias, favouring highly connected nodes. MHRW, though more computationally intensive, reduces size bias and provides more representative samples. For time-to-infection, both algorithms provide representative estimates. However, neither algorithm samples SF networks representatively, exhibiting significant variability. Furthermore, removing duplicate sample nodes reduces MHRW's accuracy across three network types. We apply both algorithms to a cattle movement network of 46,512 farms combining ER, SW, and SF features. RW overestimates infected farms by about $100\%$ and secondary infections by over $900\%$, reflecting significant size bias, while MHRW estimates align within $1\%$ of the cattle network values. RW underestimates time-to-infection by about $40\%$, while MHRW overestimates it by $10\%$. Accuracy, again, deteriorates when duplicates nodes are removed. Our findings guide algorithm selection and intervention strategies based on network structure and disease severity; RW's conservative estimates suit high-mortality, fast-spreading epidemics, while MHRW enables more precise interventions for slower epidemics.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of any multiplayer game on regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Balls-and-Boxes problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.</description>
