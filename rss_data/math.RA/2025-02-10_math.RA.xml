      <title>The action of the Nakayama automorphism of a Frobenius algebra on Hochschild cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Nakayama automorphism of a Frobenius algebra acts trivially on the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra. As an application of this fact, we show how to construct certain invariants attached to such algebras, and to their automorphisms and derivations.</description>

      <title>A family of algebraic operations extending the Turaev cobracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of maps parametrised by certain ribbon graphs. It is based on a connection in non-commutative geometry and contains the double divergence as a special case. Applying the construction to the case of the group algebra of the fundamental group of a compact connected oriented surface with boundary, we obtain an algebraic generalisation of the Turaev cobracket. If the connection is flat, they define classes in the Lie algebra cohomology of the space of derivations. In the case of the free associative algebra, we show that they are canonically identified with the standard generators of the cohomology ring of the matrix Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_n$.</description>

      <title>A bialgebra theory of post-Lie algebras via Manin triples and generalized Hessian Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a bialgebra theory of post-Lie algebras that can be characterized by Manin triples of post-Lie algebras associated to a bilinear form satisfying certain invariant conditions. In the absence of dual representations for adjoint representations of post-Lie algebras, we utilize the geometric interpretation of post-Lie algebras to find the desired invariant condition, by generalizing pseudo-Hessian Lie groups to allow constant torsion for the flat connection. The resulting notion is a generalized pseudo-Hessian post-Lie algebra, which is a post-Lie algebra equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form. Moreover, generalized pseudo-Hessian post-Lie algebras are also naturally obtained from quadratic Rota-Baxter Lie algebras of weight one. On the other hand, the notion of partial-pre-post-Lie algebra (pp-post-Lie algebras) is introduced as the algebraic structure underlying generalized pseudo-Hessian post-Lie algebras, by splitting one of the two binary operations of post-Lie algebras. The notion of pp-post-Lie bialgebras is introduced as the equivalent structure of Manin triples of post-Lie algebras associated to a nondegenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form, thereby establishing a bialgebra theory for post-Lie algebras via the Manin triple approach. We also study the related analogs of the classical Yang-Baxter equation, $\mathcal O$-operators and successors for pp-post-Lie algebras. In particular, there is a construction of pp-post-Lie bialgebras from the successors of pp-post-Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Lie algebras with compatible scalar products for non-homogeneous Hamiltonian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study from an algebraic and geometric viewpoint Hamiltonian operators which are sum of a non-degenerate first-order homogeneous operator and a Poisson tensor. In flat coordinates, also known as Darboux coordinates, these operators are uniquely determined by a triple composed by a Lie algebra, its most general non-degenerate quadratic Casimir and a 2-cocycle. We present some classes of operators associated to Lie algebras with non-degenerate quadratic Casimirs and we give a description of such operators in low dimensions. Finally, motivated by the example of the KdV equation we discuss the conditions of bi-Hamiltonianity of such operators.</description>

      <title>Commutators and products of Lie ideals of prime rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by some recent results on Lie ideals, it is proved that if $L$ is a Lie ideal of a simple ring $R$ with center $Z(R)$, then $L\subseteq Z(R)$, $L=Z(R)a+Z(R)$ for some noncentral $a\in L$, or $[R, R]\subseteq L$, which gives a generalization of a classical theorem due to Herstein. We also study commutators and products of noncentral Lie ideals of prime rings. Precisely, let $R$ be a prime ring with extended centroid $C$. We completely characterize Lie ideals $L$ and elements $a$ of $R$ such that $L+aL$ contains a nonzero ideal of $R$. Given noncentral Lie ideals $K, L$ of $R$, it is proved that $[K, L]=0$ if and only if $KC=LC=Ca+C$ for any noncentral element $a\in L$. As a consequence, we characterize noncentral Lie ideals $K_1,\ldots,K_m$ with $m\geq 2$ such that $K_1K_2\cdots K_m$ contains a nonzero ideal of $R$. Finally, we characterize noncentral Lie ideals $K_j$'s and $L_k$'s satisfying $\big[K_1K_2\cdots K_m, L_1L_2\cdots L_n\big]=0$ from the viewpoint of centralizers.</description>

      <title>Koszul Lie algebras and their subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines (restricted) Koszul Lie algebras, a class of positively graded Lie algebras with a quadratic presentation and specific cohomological properties. The study employs HNN-extensions as a key tool for decomposing and analysing these algebras.
  Building on a previous work on Koszul Lie algebras ("Kurosh theorem for certain Koszul Lie algebras", S. Blumer), this paper also deals with Bloch-Kato Lie algebras, which constitute a distinguished subclass of that of Koszul Lie algebras where all subalgebras generated by elements of degree $1$ have a quadratic presentation.
  It is shown that Bloch-Kato Lie algebras satisfy a version of the Levi decomposition theorem and that they satisfy the Toral Rank Conjecture. Two new families of such Lie algebras are introduced, including all graded Lie algebras generated in degree $1$ and defined by two quadratic relations.
  Throughout the paper, we show many properties of right-angled Artin graded (RAAG) Lie algebras, which form a large class of Koszul Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Nilmanifolds with non-nilpotent complex structures and their pseudo-K\"ahler geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify nilpotent Lie algebras with complex structures of weakly non-nilpotent type in real dimension eight, which is the lowest dimension where they arise. Our study, together with previous results on strongly non-nilpotent structures, completes the classification of 8-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras admitting complex structures of non-nilpotent type. As an application, we identify those that support a pseudo-K\"ahler metric, thus providing new counterexamples to a previous conjecture and an infinite family of (Ricci-flat) non-flat neutral Calabi-Yau structures. Moreover, we arrive at the topological restriction $b_1(X)\geq 3$ for every pseudo-K\"ahler nilmanifold $X$ with invariant complex structure, up to complex dimension four.</description>

      <title>Strongly sofic monoids, sofic topological entropy, and surjunctivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class of strongly sofic monoids. This class of monoids strictly contains the class of sofic groups and is a proper subclass of the class of sofic monoids. We define and investigate sofic topological entropy for actions of strongly sofic monoids on compact spaces. We show that sofic topological entropy is a topological conjugacy invariant for such actions and use this fact to prove that every strongly sofic monoid is surjunctive. This means that if $M$ is a strongly sofic monoid and $A$ is a finite alphabet set, then every injective cellular automaton $\tau \colon A^M \to A^M$ is surjective. As an application, we prove that the monoid algebra of a strongly sofic monoid with coefficients in an arbitrary field is always stably finite. Our results are extensions to strongly sofic monoids of two previously known properties of sofic groups. The first one is the celebrated Gromov-Weiss theorem asserting that every sofic group is surjunctive. The second is the Elek-Szab\'o theorem which says that group algebras of sofic groups satisfy Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture.</description>
