      <title>Impact of COVID-19 on Exchange rate volatility of Bangladesh: Evidence through GARCH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses the GARCH (1,1) model to examine the impact of COVID-19 cases (log value) on the volatility of the Exchange rate return of Bangladeshi taka (BDT) over the US dollar (USD), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Swedish Krona (SEK). The result shows that an increase in the number of COVID-19-affected cases in Bangladesh has a significant and positive impact on the volatility of exchange rates BDT/USD, BDT/JPY, and BDT/SEK.</description>

      <title>Bias in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzed images generated by three popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools - Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALLE 2 - representing various occupations to investigate potential bias in AI generators. Our analysis revealed two overarching areas of concern in these AI generators, including (1) systematic gender and racial biases, and (2) subtle biases in facial expressions and appearances. Firstly, we found that all three AI generators exhibited bias against women and African Americans. Moreover, we found that the evident gender and racial biases uncovered in our analysis were even more pronounced than the status quo when compared to labor force statistics or Google images, intensifying the harmful biases we are actively striving to rectify in our society. Secondly, our study uncovered more nuanced prejudices in the portrayal of emotions and appearances. For example, women were depicted as younger with more smiles and happiness, while men were depicted as older with more neutral expressions and anger, posing a risk that generative AI models may unintentionally depict women as more submissive and less competent than men. Such nuanced biases, by their less overt nature, might be more problematic as they can permeate perceptions unconsciously and may be more difficult to rectify. Although the extent of bias varied depending on the model, the direction of bias remained consistent in both commercial and open-source AI generators. As these tools become commonplace, our study highlights the urgency to identify and mitigate various biases in generative AI, reinforcing the commitment to ensuring that AI technologies benefit all of humanity for a more inclusive future.</description>

      <title>Medical Bill Shock and Imperfect Moral Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consumers are sensitive to medical prices when consuming care, but delays in price information may distort moral hazard. We study how medical bills affect household spillover spending following utilization, leveraging variation in insurer claim processing times. Households increase spending by 22\% after a scheduled service, but then reduce spending by 11\% after the bill arrives. Observed bill effects are consistent with resolving price uncertainty; bill effects are strongest when pricing information is particularly salient. A model of demand for healthcare with delayed pricing information suggests households misperceive pricing signals prior to bills, and that correcting these perceptions reduce average (median) spending by 16\% (7\%) annually.</description>

      <title>Agree to Disagree: Measuring Hidden Dissents in FOMC Meetings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a record of dissents on FOMC votes and transcripts of the meetings from 1976 to 2017, we develop a deep learning model based on self-attention mechanism to create a measure of disagreement for members in each meeting. While dissents are rare, we find that members often have reservations with the policy decision, and the level of disagreement is mostly driven by current or predicted macroeconomic data. Using our model to evaluate speeches made by members between meetings, we find that the informational content of speeches is low if we can only compare them to speeches made by the chair. Disagreement strongly correlates with data from the Summary of Economic Projections and a measure of monetary policy sub-optimality, suggesting that disagreement is driven by both members' different preferences and their different views about the future.</description>

      <title>Islamic Law, Western European Law and the Roots of Middle East's Long Divergence: a Comparative Empirical Investigation (800-1600)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the contribution of Islamic legal institutions to the comparative economic decline of the Middle East behind Latin Europe, which can be observed since the late Middle Ages. To this end, we explore whether the sacralization of Islamic law and its focus on the Sharia as supreme, sacred and unchangeable legal text, which reached its culmination in the 13th century had an impact on economic development. We use the population size of 145 cities in Islamic countries and 648 European cities for the period 800-1800 as proxies for the level of economic development, and construct novel estimates of the number of law schools (i.e. madaris) and estimate their contribution to the pre-industrial economic development. Our triple-differences estimates show that a higher density of madrasas before the sacralization of Islamic law predicts a more vibrant urban economy characterized by higher urban growth. After the consolidation of the sharia sacralization of law in the 13th century, greater density of law schools is associated with stagnating population size. We show that the economic decline of the Middle East can be partly explained by the absence of legal innovations or substitutes of them, which paved the way for the economic rise of Latin Europe, where ground-breaking legal reforms introduced a series of legal innovations conducive for economic growth. We find that the number of learned lawyers trained in universities with law schools is highly and positively correlated with the western European city population. Our counterfactual estimates show that almost all Islamic cities under consideration would have had much larger size by the year 1700 if legal innovations comparable to those in Western Europe were introduced. By making use of a series of synthetic control and difference-in-differences estimators our findings are robust against a large number of model specification checks.</description>

      <title>Design-Robust Two-Way-Fixed-Effects Regression For Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new estimator for average causal effects of a binary treatment with panel data in settings with general treatment patterns. Our approach augments the popular two-way-fixed-effects specification with unit-specific weights that arise from a model for the assignment mechanism. We show how to construct these weights in various settings, including the staggered adoption setting, where units opt into the treatment sequentially but permanently. The resulting estimator converges to an average (over units and time) treatment effect under the correct specification of the assignment model, even if the fixed effect model is misspecified. We show that our estimator is more robust than the conventional two-way estimator: it remains consistent if either the assignment mechanism or the two-way regression model is correctly specified. In addition, the proposed estimator performs better than the two-way-fixed-effect estimator if the outcome model and assignment mechanism are locally misspecified. This strong double robustness property underlines and quantifies the benefits of modeling the assignment process and motivates using our estimator in practice. We also discuss an extension of our estimator to handle dynamic treatment effects.</description>
