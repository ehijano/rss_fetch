      <title>Phase-field models for ductile fatigue fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fatigue fracture is one of the main causes of failure in structures. However, the simulation of fatigue crack growth is computationally demanding due to the large number of load cycles involved. Metals in the low cycle fatigue range often show significant plastic zones at the crack tip, calling for elastic-plastic material models, which increase the computation time even further. In pursuit of a more efficient model, we propose a simplified phase-field model for ductile fatigue fracture, which indirectly accounts for plasticity within the fatigue damage accumulation. Additionally, a cycle-skipping approach is inherent to the concept, reducing computation time by up to several orders of magnitude.
  Essentially, the proposed model is a simplification of a phase-field model with elastic-plastic material behavior. As a reference, we therefore implement a conventional elastic-plastic phase-field fatigue model with nonlinear hardening and a fatigue variable based on the strain energy density, and compare the simplified model to it. Its approximation of the stress-strain behavior, the neglect of the plastic crack driving force and consequential range of applicability are discussed.
  Since in fact the novel efficient model is similar in its structure to a phase-field fatigue model we published in the past, we include this older version in the comparison, too. Compared to this model variant, the novel model improves the approximation of the plastic strains and corresponding stresses and refines the damage computation based on the Local Strain Approach. For all model variants, experimentally determined values for elastic, plastic, fracture and fatigue properties of AA2024 T351 aluminum sheet material are employed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of recently demonstrated joint use of novel Fourier-transform techniques and effective high-accuracy frequency domain solvers related to the Method of Moments, it is argued that a set of transformative innovations could be developed for the effective, accurate and efficient simulation of problems of wave propagation and scattering of broadband, time-dependent wavefields. This contribution aims to convey the character of these methods and to highlight their applicability in computational modeling of electromagnetic configurations across various fields of science and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) community has recently seen a substantial diversification of hardware platforms and their associated programming models. From traditional multicore processors to highly specialized accelerators, vendors and tool developers back up the relentless progress of those architectures. In the context of scientific programming, it is fundamental to consider performance portability frameworks, i.e., software tools that allow programmers to write code once and run it on different computer architectures without sacrificing performance. We report here on the benefits and challenges of performance portability using a field-line tracing simulation and a particle-in-cell code, two relevant applications in computational plasma physics with applications to magnetically-confined nuclear-fusion energy research. For these applications we report performance results obtained on four HPC platforms with server-class CPUs from Intel (Xeon) and AMD (EPYC), and high-end GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, including the latest Nvidia H100 GPU and the novel AMD Instinct MI300A APU. Our results show that both Kokkos and OpenMP are powerful tools to achieve performance portability and decent "out-of-the-box" performance, even for the very latest hardware platforms. For our applications, Kokkos provided performance portability to the broadest range of hardware architectures from different vendors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Accuracy and Feature Insights in Hydration Free Energy Predictions for Small Molecules with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of solvation free energy is of significant importance as it governs the behavior of solutes in solution. In this work, we apply a variety of machine learning techniques to predict and analyze the alchemical free energy of small molecules. Our methodology incorporates an ensemble of machine learning models with feature processing using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. Two training strategies are explored: one based on experimental data, and the other based on the offset between molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental measurements. The latter approach yields a substantial improvement in predictive accuracy, achieving a mean unsigned error (MUE) of 0.64 kcal/mol. Feature analysis identifies molecular geometry and topology as the most critical factors in predicting alchemical free energy, supporting the established theory that surface tension is a key determinant. Furthermore, the feature analysis of offset results highlights the relevance of charge distribution within the system, which correlates with the inaccuracies in force fields employed in MD simulations and may provide guidance for improving force field designs. These results suggest that machine learning approaches can effectively capture the complex features governing solvation free energy, offering novel pathways for enhancing predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Diagonalization without Diagonalization: A Direct Optimization Approach for Solid-State Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to address the challenges of variable occupation numbers in direct optimization of density functional theory (DFT). By parameterizing both the eigenfunctions and the occupation matrix, our method minimizes the free energy with respect to these parameters. As the stationary conditions require the occupation matrix and the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian to be simultaneously diagonalizable, this leads to the concept of ``self-diagonalization,'' where, by assuming a diagonal occupation matrix without loss of generality, the Hamiltonian matrix naturally becomes diagonal at stationary points. Our method incorporates physical constraints on both the eigenfunctions and the occupations into the parameterization, transforming the constrained optimization into an fully differentiable unconstrained problem, which is solvable via gradient descent. Implemented in JAX, our method was tested on aluminum and silicon, confirming that it achieves efficient self-diagonalization, produces the correct Fermi-Dirac distribution of the occupation numbers and yields band structures consistent with those obtained with SCF methods in Quantum Espresso.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional quantum dynamics with explicitly correlated Gaussian wave packets using Rothe's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous publication [J. Chem. Phys., 161, 044105 (2024)], it has been shown that Rothe's method can be used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) for the hydrogen atom in a strong laser field using time-dependent Gaussian wave packets. Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe's method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, explicitly correlated Gaussian functions (ECGs) with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Henon-Heiles potential, and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D, and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30 to 40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Thus, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe's method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.</description>

      <title>Combining Bayesian Optimization, SVD and Machine Learning for Advanced Optical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and optimization of optical components, such as Bragg gratings, are critical for applications in telecommunications, sensing, and photonic circuits. To overcome the limitations of traditional design methods that rely heavily on computationally intensive simulations and large datasets, we propose an integrated methodology that significantly reduces these burdens while maintaining high accuracy in predicting optical response. First, we employ a Bayesian optimization technique to strategically select a limited yet informative number of simulation points from the design space, ensuring that each contributes maximally to the model's performance. Second, we utilize singular value decomposition to effectively parametrize the entire reflectance spectra into a reduced set of coefficients, allowing us to capture all significant spectral features without losing crucial information. Finally, we apply XGBoost, a robust machine learning algorithm, to predict the entire reflectance spectra from the reduced dataset. The combination of Bayesian optimization for data selection, SVD for full-spectrum fitting, and XGBoost for predictive modeling provides a powerful, generalizable framework for the design of optical components.</description>

      <title>Piezovalley effect and magnetovalley coupling in altermagnetic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05518v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarifying the physical origin of valley polarization and exploring promising ferrovalley materials are conducive to the application of valley degrees of freedom in the field of information storage. Here, we explore two novel altermagnetic semiconductors (monolayers Nb2Se2O and Nb2SeTeO) with N\'eel temperature above room temperature based on first-principles calculations. It reveals that uniaxial strain induces valley polarization without spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in altermagnets owing to the piezovalley effect, while uniaxial compressive strain transforms the intrinsic ferrovalley semiconductor into a semimetal, half metal and metal. Moreover, moderate biaxial strain renders Janus monolayer Nb2SeTeO to robust Dirac-like band dispersion. The SOC and intrinsic in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy induce Dirac-like altermagnets to generate apparent valley polarization through magnetovalley coupling. In terms of SOC perturbation, we elucidate the physical mechanism behind in-plane-magnetization induced valley polarization and demonstrate the magnitude of valley polarization is positively correlated with the square of SOC strength and negatively correlated with the bandgap. The present work reveals the physical origin of valley polarization in altermagnets and expands the application of ferrovalley at room temperature in valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Smart navigation through a rotating barrier: Deep reinforcement learning with application to size-based separation of active microagents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (agents) that self-propel through a rotating, localized potential barrier in an otherwise static and viscous fluid background. The particle motion is prescribed to begin from a specified start point and terminate at a specified destination point. The potential barrier is modeled as a repulsive Gaussian potential with a finite range that rotates with given angular velocities around a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use an advantage actor-critic approach to train the agents and demonstrate that, by leveraging this approach, the rotating potential can be utilized for size-based sorting and separation of the agents. In other words, agents of different (hydrodynamic) radii reach the end-point at sufficiently well-separated times, enabling their separation. The efficiency of particle separation in this context is discussed using specific criteria. We also study the effect of rotational Brownian noise on the quality of the proposed size-based sorting mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate how the use of noise-induced training can enhance this mechanism in a noisy background within the range of parameters explored in our work. Reinforcement learning in the context of active particles thus offers promising avenues to unravel optimal navigation strategies within complex environments, with potential applications that can be utilized in microfluidic settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum hyperspins: Highly nonclassical collective behavior in quantum optical parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the emergence of a highly non-classical collective behavior in quantum parametric oscillators, which we name quantum hyperspin, induced by a tailored nonlinear interaction. This is the second quantized version of classical multidimensional spherical spins, as XY spins in two dimensions, and Heisenberg spins in three dimensions. In the phase space, the quantum hyperspins are represented as spherical shells whose radius scales with the number of particles in a way such that it cannot be factorized even in the limit of large particle number. We show that the nonlinearly coupled quantum oscillators form a high-dimensional entangled state that is surprisingly robust with respect to the coupling with the environment. Such a behavior results from a properly engineered reservoir. Networks of entangled quantum hyperspins are a new approach to quantum simulations for applications in computing, Ising machines, and high-energy physics models. We analyze from first principles through ab initio numerical simulations the properties of quantum hyperspins, including the interplay of entanglement and coupling frustration.</description>

      <title>Latest progress on the reduced-order particle-in-cell scheme: I. refining the underlying formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle-in-cell (PIC) method is a well-established and widely used kinetic plasma modelling approach that provides a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian approach to solve the plasma kinetic equation. Despite its power in capturing details of the underlying physics of plasmas, conventional PIC implementations are associated with a significant computational cost, rendering their applications for real-world plasma science and engineering challenges impractical. The acceleration of the PIC method has thus become a topic of high interest, with several approaches having been pursued to this end. Among these, the concept of reduced-order (RO) PIC simulations, first introduced in 2023, provides a uniquely flexible and computationally efficient framework for kinetic plasma modelling - characteristics verified extensively in various plasma configurations. In this two-part article, we report the latest progress achieved on RO-PIC. Part I article revisits the original RO-PIC formulation and introduces refinements that substantially enhance the cost-efficiency and accuracy of the method. We discuss these refinements in comparison against the original formulation, illustrating the progression to a "first-order" implementation from the baseline "zeroth-order" one. In a detailed step-by-step verification, we first test the newly updated reduced-dimension Poisson solver (RDPS) in the first-order RO-PIC against its zeroth-order counterpart using test-case Poisson problems. Next, comparing against the zeroth-order version, we examine the performance of the complete first-order RO-PIC code in two-dimensional plasma problems. The detailed verifications demonstrate that the improvements in the RO-PIC formulation enable the approach to provide full-2D-equivalent results at a substantially lower (up to an order of magnitude) computational cost compared to the zeroth-order RO-PIC.</description>

      <title>Latest progress on the reduced-order particle-in-cell scheme: II. Quasi-3D implementation and verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across many plasma applications, the underlying phenomena and interactions among the involved processes are known to exhibit three-dimensional characteristics. Furthermore, the global properties and evolution of plasma systems are often determined by a process called inverse energy cascade, where kinetic plasma processes at the microscopic scale interact and lead to macroscopic coherent structures. These structures can have a major impact on the stability of plasma discharges, with detrimental effects on the operation and performance of plasma technologies. Kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) methods offer a sufficient level of fidelity to capture these processes and behaviors. However, three-dimensional PIC simulations that can cost-effectively overcome the curse of dimensionality and enable full-scale simulations of real-world time significance have remained elusive. Tackling the enormous computational cost issue associated with conventional PIC schemes, the computationally efficient reduced-order (RO) PIC approach provides a viable path to 3D simulations of real-size plasma systems. This part II paper builds upon the improvements to the RO-PIC's underpinning formulation discussed in part I and extends the novel "first-order" RO-PIC formulation to 3D. The resulting Quasi-3D (Q3D) implementation is rigorously verified in this paper, both at the module level of the Q3D reduced-dimension Poisson solver (RDPS) and at the global PIC code level. The plasma test cases employed correspond to 3D versions of the 2D configurations studied in Part I, including a 3D extension to the Diocotron instability problem. The detailed verifications of the Q3D RO-PIC confirm that it maintains the expected levels of cost-efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating the ability of the approach to indistinguishably reproduce full-3D simulation results at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>The Helmholtz Dirichlet and Neumann problems on piecewise smooth open curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical scheme is presented for solving the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on piecewise smooth open curves, where the curves may have corners and multiple junctions. Existing integral equation methods for smooth open curves rely on analyzing the exact singularities of the density at endpoints for associated integral operators, explicitly extracting these singularities from the densities in the formulation, and using global quadrature to discretize the boundary integral equation. Extending these methods to handle curves with corners and multiple junctions is challenging because the singularity analysis becomes much more complex, and constructing high-order quadrature for discretizing layer potentials with singular and hypersingular kernels and singular densities is nontrivial. The proposed scheme is built upon the following two observations. First, the single-layer potential operator and the normal derivative of the double-layer potential operator serve as effective preconditioners for each other locally. Second, the recursively compressed inverse preconditioning (RCIP) method can be extended to address "implicit" second-kind integral equations. The scheme is high-order, adaptive, and capable of handling corners and multiple junctions without prior knowledge of the density singularity. It is also compatible with fast algorithms, such as the fast multipole method. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: The automatic differentiation (AD) in the vanilla physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is the computational bottleneck for the high-efficiency analysis. The concept of derivative discretization in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can provide an accelerated training method for PINNs. In this paper, smoothing kernel physics-informed neural networks (SK-PINNs) are established, which solve differential equations using smoothing kernel discretization. It is a robust framework capable of solving problems in the computational mechanics of complex domains. When the number of collocation points gradually increases, the training speed of SK-PINNs significantly surpasses that of vanilla PINNs. In cases involving large collocation point sets or higher-order problems, SK-PINN training can be up to tens of times faster than vanilla PINN. Additionally, analysis using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory shows that the convergence rates of SK-PINNs are consistent with those of vanilla PINNs. The superior performance of SK-PINNs is demonstrated through various examples, including regular and complex domains, as well as forward and inverse problems in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Domain decomposition is a technique used to reduce memory overhead on large neutron transport problems. Currently, the optimal load-balanced processor allocation for these domains is typically determined through small-scale simulations of the problem, which can be time-consuming for researchers and must be repeated anytime a problem input is changed. We propose a Transformer model with a unique 3D input embedding, and input representations designed for domain-decomposed neutron transport problems, which can predict the subdomain computation loads generated by small-scale simulations. We demonstrate that such a model trained on domain-decomposed Small Modular Reactor (SMR) simulations achieves 98.2% accuracy while being able to skip the small-scale simulation step entirely. Tests of the model's robustness on variant fuel assemblies, other problem geometries, and changes in simulation parameters are also discussed.</description>
