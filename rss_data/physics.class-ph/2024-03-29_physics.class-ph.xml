      <title>Symmetry criteria for the equality of interior and exterior shape factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lienhard (2019) reported that the shape factor of the interior of a simply-connected region ($\Omega$) is equal to that of its exterior ($\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\Omega$) under the same boundary conditions. In that study, numerical examples supported the claim in particular cases; for example, it was shown that for certain boundary conditions on circles and squares, the conjecture holds. In the present paper, we show that the conjecture is not generally true, unless some additional condition is met. We proceed by elucidating why the conjecture does in fact hold in all of the examples analysed by Lienhard. We thus deduce a simple criterion which, when satisfied, ensures the equality of interior and exterior shape factors in general. Our criterion notably relies on a beautiful and little-known symmetry method due to Hersch (1982) which we introduce in a tutorial manner.</description>

      <title>Capillary-lubrication force between rotating cylinders separated by a fluid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two cylinders rotating next to each other generate a large hydrodynamic force if the intermediate space is filled with a viscous fluid. Herein, we explore the case where the cylinders are separated by two layers of viscous immiscible fluids, in the limit of small capillary deformation of the fluid interface. As the interface deformation breaks the system's symmetry, a novel force characteristic of soft lubrication is generated. We calculate this capillary-lubrication force, which is split into velocity-dependant and acceleration-dependant contributions. Furthermore, we analyze the variations induced by modifying the viscosity ratio between the two fluid layers, their thickness ratio, and the Bond number. Unlike standard elastic cases, where a repelling soft-lubrication lift force has been abundantly reported, the current fluid bilayer setting can also exhibit an attractive force due to the non-monotonic deflection of the fluid interface when varying the sublayer thickness. Besides, at high Bond numbers, the system's response becomes analogous to the one of a Winkler-like substrate with a viscous flow inside.</description>
