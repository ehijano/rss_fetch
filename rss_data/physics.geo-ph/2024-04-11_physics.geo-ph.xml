      <title>A fine-tuning workflow for automatic first-break picking with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-break picking is an essential step in seismic data processing. First arrivals should be picked by an expert. This is a time-consuming procedure and subjective to a certain degree, leading to different results for different operators. In this study, we used a U-Net architecture with residual blocks to perform automatic first-break picking based on deep learning. Focusing on the effects of weight initialization on this process, we conduct this research by using the weights of a pretrained network that is used for object detection on the ImageNet dataset. The efficiency of the proposed method is tested on two real datasets. For both datasets, we pick manually the first breaks for less than 10% of the seismic shots. The pretrained network is fine-tuned on the picked shots and the rest of the shots are automatically picked by the neural network. It is shown that this strategy allows to reduce the size of the training set, requiring fine tuning with only a few picked shots per survey. Using random weights and more training epochs can lead to a lower training loss, but such a strategy leads to overfitting as the test error is higher than the one of the pretrained network. We also assess the possibility of using a general dataset by training a network with data from three different projects that are acquired with different equipment and at different locations. This study shows that if the general dataset is created carefully it can lead to more accurate first-break picking, otherwise the general dataset can decrease the accuracy. Focusing on near-surface geophysics, we perform traveltime tomography and compare the inverted velocity models based on different first-break picking methodologies. The results of the inversion show that the first breaks obtained by the pretrained network lead to a velocity model that is closer to the one obtained from the inversion of expert-picked first breaks.</description>

      <title>Towards resolving bedload flux variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bedload transport occurs when a bed composed of sedimentary grains becomes mobile in response to the shearing by a flow of liquid. It shapes the landscapes of Earth and other planetary bodies by promoting the formation and growth of various multiscale geological features. Estimating the rate at which such processes take place requires accurate bedload flux predictions. However, even for highly idealized conditions in the laboratory, study-to-study variability of reported bedload flux measurements borders an order of magnitude. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, typically empirical methods of determining the transport-driving bed shear stress, especially for very narrow or shallow channel flows, and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive a non-empirical method of bed shear stress determination and apply it to a number of independent grain-shape-controlled data sets, based on well-controlled experiments and CFD-DEM simulations, for a very diverse range of transport conditions. An existing physical bedload model, here generalized to account for grain shape variability, predicts almost all these data within a factor of 1.3, whereas a prominent alternative model (Deal et al., Nature 613, 298-302, 2023) seems falsified.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of temporal variability of long-duration bursts of high-energy radiation associated with thunderclouds on the Tibetan plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From 1998 to 2017, neutron monitors located at an altitude of 4300 m on the Tibetan plateau detected 127 long-duration bursts of high-energy radiation in association with thunderclouds. These bursts typically lasted for 10 to 40 minutes, and 89\% of them occurred between 10:00 and 24:00 local time. They were also found to be more likely to occur at night, especially during 18:00$-$06:00 local time period. The observed diurnal and seasonal variations in burst frequency were consistent with the frequencies of lightning and precipitation on the Tibetan plateau. Based on 19 years of data, the present study suggests that an annual variation in burst frequency has a periodicity of $\sim$16 years and a lag of $\sim$3 years relative to solar activity.</description>

      <title>Coupling nanoscopic tomography and micromagnetic modelling to assess the stability of geomagnetic recorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recording of planetary magnetic fields is often attributed to uniformly-magnetised nanoscopic iron oxides, called single-domain (SD). Yet, the main magnetic constituents of rocks are more complex, non-uniformly magnetised grains in single or multi-vortex states. We know little about their behaviour due to limitations in defining their precise shape and internal magnetic structure. We propose a novel approach combining non-destructive synchrotron-based ptychographic nanotomography with micromagnetic modelling to explore the magnetic stability of remanence-bearing minerals. Applied to a microscopic rock sample, we identified hundreds of nanoscopic grains of magnetite/maghemite with diverse morphologies. For some grains, shape irregularities near the transition from SD to the single-vortex state allow for multiple domain states, some unstable and unable to record the field for significant periods. Additionally, some other grains exhibit temperature-dependent occupancy probabilities, potentially hampering experiments to recover the intensity of past magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Robust elastic full-waveform inversion using an alternating direction method of multipliers with reconstructed wavefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic full-waveform inversion (EFWI) is a process used to estimate subsurface properties by fitting seismic data while satisfying wave propagation physics. The problem is formulated as a least-squares data fitting minimization problem with two sets of constraints: Partial-differential equation (PDE) constraints governing elastic wave propagation and physical model constraints implementing prior information. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used to solve the problem, resulting in an iterative algorithm with well-conditioned subproblems. Although wavefield reconstruction is the most challenging part of the iteration, sparse linear algebra techniques can be used for moderate-sized problems and frequency domain formulations. The Hessian matrix is blocky with diagonal blocks, making model updates fast. Gradient ascent is used to update Lagrange multipliers by summing PDE violations. Various numerical examples are used to investigate algorithmic components, including model parameterizations, physical model constraints, the role of the Hessian matrix in suppressing interparameter cross-talk, computational efficiency with the source sketching method, and the effect of noise and near-surface effects.</description>
