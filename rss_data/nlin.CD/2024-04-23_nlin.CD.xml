      <title>Machine learning for climate physics and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the emerging advances and opportunities at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and climate physics, highlighting the use of ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and equation discovery, to accelerate climate knowledge discoveries and simulations. We delineate two distinct yet complementary aspects: (1) ML for climate physics and (2) ML for climate simulations. While physics-free ML-based models, such as ML-based weather forecasting, have demonstrated success when data is abundant and stationary, the physics knowledge and interpretability of ML models become crucial in the small-data/non-stationary regime to ensure generalizability. Given the absence of observations, the long-term future climate falls into the small-data regime. Therefore, ML for climate physics holds a critical role in addressing the challenges of ML for climate simulations. We emphasize the need for collaboration among climate physics, ML theory, and numerical analysis to achieve reliable ML-based models for climate applications.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-Based Projections for Uncertainty Quantification near Stochastically Perturbed Limit Cycles and Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new boundary-value problem formulation for quantifying uncertainty induced by the presence of small Brownian noise near transversally stable periodic orbits (limit cycles) and quasiperiodic invariant tori of the deterministic dynamical systems obtained in the absence of noise. The formulation uses adjoints to construct a continuous family of transversal hyperplanes that are invariant under the linearized deterministic flow near the limit cycle or quasiperiodic invariant torus. The intersections with each hyperplane of stochastic trajectories that remain near the deterministic cycle or torus over intermediate times may be approximated by a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix can be obtained from the solution to the corresponding boundary-value problem. In the case of limit cycles, the analysis improves upon results in the literature through the explicit use of state-space projections, transversality constraints, and symmetry-breaking parameters that ensure uniqueness of the solution despite the lack of hyperbolicity along the limit cycle. These same innovations are then generalized to the case of a quasiperiodic invariant torus of arbitrary dimension. In each case, a closed-form solution to the covariance boundary-value problem is found in terms of a convergent series. The methodology is validated against the results of numerical integration for two examples of stochastically perturbed limit cycles and one example of a stochastically perturbed two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus. Finally, an implementation of the covariance boundary-value problem in the numerical continuation package coco is applied to analyze the small-noise limit near a two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus in a nonlinear deterministic dynamical system in $\mathbb{R}^4$ that does not support closed-form analysis.</description>

      <title>Eclectic Notes on Uncertainty, Information, and Classical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information is everywhere in nature which is very uncertain and unpredictable. But information, in itself, is a very ambiguous term. In this cursory write-up, we attempt to understand the formal meaning of information by quantifying uncertainty and discuss how it naturally appears in two core topics of classical physics -- classical mechanics and statistical mechanics. In the process, we witness how the concepts of the information theory render a unique viewpoint in physics. Except for the presentation of the material, the author claims no originality; however, the responsibility of every inadvertent error lies entirely with the author.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Analysis of Crises in a Chaotically Forced Ocean Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a coupling of the Stommel box model and the Lorenz model, with the goal of investigating the so-called "crises" that are known to occur given sufficient forcing. In this context, a crisis is characterized as the destruction of a chaotic attractor under a critical forcing strength. We document the variety of chaotic attractors and crises possible in our model, focusing on the parameter region where the Lorenz model is always chaotic and where bistability exists in the Stommel box model. The chaotic saddle collisions that occur in a boundary crisis are visualized, with the chaotic saddle computed using the Saddle-Straddle Algorithm. We identify a novel sub-type of boundary crisis, namely a vanishing basin crisis. For forcing strength beyond the crisis, we demonstrate the possibility of a merging between the persisting chaotic attractor and either a chaotic transient or a ghost attractor depending on the type of boundary crisis. An investigation of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents around crisis levels of forcing reveals a convergence between two near-neutral exponents, particularly at points of a trajectory most sensitive to divergence. This points to loss of hyperbolicity associated with crisis occurrence. Finally, we generalize our findings by coupling the Stommel box model to other strange attractors and thereby show that the behaviours are quite generic and robust.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly dispersive nature of Galerkin-regularization and longon turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With derivatives for physical insights and with mathematical analyses, technical variations and applications though, the dynamical nature of Galerkin truncation keeping finite Fourier modes in a nonlinear system is unclear. Here, I show with such Galerkin-regularized Burgers-Hopf (GrBH) equation that the truncation corresponds to a nonlinear dispersion, supporting solitons and soliton-like structures (called ``longons'') and rhyming with other expositions of dispersive objects. The formulation and scenarios resemble those of soliton turbulence, thus suggesting ``longon turbulence" with large degree of freedoms (finite though). I also argue and numerically demonstrate that appropriate linear dispersion functions with a large jump lead asymptotically to the GrBH dynamics.</description>

      <title>A quaternion-based mathematical model for geometrically exact dynamic analysis of cantilevered pipe conveying fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, the development of the nonlinear geometrically exact governing equations and corresponding boundary conditions of hanging cantilevered flexible pipes conveying fluid in the framework of the quaternion system is undertaken. Additionally, the linear model is derived from the nonlinear one for the stability analysis. The linear and nonlinear mathematical formulations based on the geometrically exact rotation-based model are also extracted from the current model. The obtained integro-partial differential-algebraic equations are converted to a set of ordinary differential algebraic equations via the Galerkin discretization technique, and the resulting equations are numerically solved to determine the self-excited oscillation behavior of the system in the post-flutter region. The critical flow velocities, time traces, bifurcation diagrams, phase planes, and deformed configurations are compared with those reported based on the geometrically exact rotation-based model. The comparative studies divulge that the present model can successfully capture the stability and dynamic characteristics of the system. An interesting feature of the current ordinary differential-algebraic equations is that their coefficients are time-independent, unlike those of geometrically exact rotation-based equations in the Galerkin form. The results show this feature leads to a remarkable decrease in the computational cost, although the number of equations increases and the nonlinearity becomes stronger. The challenging issues with the numerical solution utilized in this study are also discussed.</description>
