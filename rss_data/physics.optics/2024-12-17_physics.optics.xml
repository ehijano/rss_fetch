      <title>Nanoparticle doping as a way to enhance holmium fiber lasers efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly-doped holmium fibers have been prepared using modified chemical vapor deposition in combination with nanoparticle-doping method. Within a series of various Al2O3 and Ho3+ concentrations, relations between fibers composition and their fluorescence and laser parameters have been studied. Al/Ho molar ratio equal to at least 50 was found to be the key factor for fibers with outstanding parameters. Fibers with slope efficiency above 80%, laser threshold below 100 mW and fluorescence lifetime up to 1.6 ms have been prepared. Thanks to high Al2O3 concentrations, obtained through nanoparticle doping, we were able to achieve high-performance fibers in a wide range of Ho3+ concentrations. An output power of 19 W with 81% slope efficiency was reached using fiber with almost 4000 ppm of Ho3+ and 10 mol.% of Al2O3. This result is encouraging for highly efficient high-power cladding-pumped holmium fiber lasers, and studied relations between fibers composition and their laser parameters will be used in the designing of such laser sources.</description>

      <title>Bright and Purcell-enhanced single photon emission from a silicon G center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon G centers show significant promise as single photon sources in a scalable silicon platform. But these color centers have large non-radiative decay and a low Debye-Waller factor, limiting their usability in quantum applications. In this work, we demonstrate bright Purcell-enhanced emission from a silicon G center by coupling it to a nanophotonic cavity. The nanobeam cavity enhances the spontaneous emission rate of a single G center by a factor of 6, corresponding to a Purcell factor greater than 31 when accounting for decay into the phonon sideband. We obtain a spontaneous emission rate of 0.97 ns, which is the fastest single photon emission rate reported in silicon. With this radiative enhancement, we achieve an order of magnitude improvement in emitter brightness compared to previously reported values. These results pave the way for scalable quantum light sources on a silicon photonic chip.</description>

      <title>On the low frequency flexural band gaps of a metamaterial plate with low porosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates numerically and experimentally that it is possible to tailor flexural band gaps in the low-frequency regime by appropriate choice of cutout characteristics. The finite element method is used to obtain the numerical dispersion relation and band gaps. The influence of the cutout's shape, size, and location on the band gap is systematically studied. The study demonstrates that the cutout should pass through the center of the unit cell, and a large aspect ratio is required to introduce flexural band gaps in the low-frequency regime. This is validated by experiments on a finite plate with 3 $\times$ 3 unit cells.</description>

      <title>Model and theory of dark photons in the visible light range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of the existence of dark photons within the visible light range and provides evidence for their existence through a thought experiment. A new model of dark photons is established based on extensive theoretical research, forming a comprehensive theory of dark photons. This theory provides a reasonable explanation for certain perplexing optical phenomena, such as the wave-particle duality of light, Young's double-slit experiment, as well as phenomena like dark matter, dark energy, stellar spectral redshift, and negative time. Furthermore, this theory holds reference value for studying the properties of other fundamental particles and exploring quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Long lived surface plasmons on the interface of a metal and a photonic time-crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the existence of surface plasmons polaritons at the interface between a metal and a periodically modulated dielectric medium, and find an unusual multi-branched dispersion curve of surface and bulk modes. The branches are separated by momentum gaps indicating intense amplification of modes, and display high and low group velocity ranging from zero to infinity at short wavelengths. We simulate how these SPP modes are formed by launching a properly engineered laser beam onto the metallic interface and examine their space-time evolution. The amplification of the surface plasmons at the interface with a photonic time-crystal offers a path to overcome plasmonic losses, which have been a major challenge in plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Room temperature exciton-polariton neural network with perovskite crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limitations of electronics have stimulated the search for novel unconventional computing platforms that enable energy-efficient and ultra-fast information processing. Among various systems, exciton-polaritons stand out as promising candidates for the realization of optical neuromorphic devices. This is due to their unique hybrid light-matter properties, resulting in strong optical nonlinearity and excellent transport capabilities. However, previous implementations of polariton neural networks have been restricted to cryogenic temperatures, limiting their practical applications. In this work, using non-equillibrium Bose-Einstein condensation in a monocrystalline perovskite waveguide, we demonstrate the first room-temperature exciton-polariton neural network. Its performance is verified in various machine learning tasks, including binary classification, and object detection. Our result is a crucial milestone in the development of practical applications of polariton neural networks and provides new perspectives for optical computing accelerators based on perovskites.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal mode as a foundational framework for all electromagnetic Fano resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fano profiles are observed across various fields of wave physics. They emerge from interference phenomena and are quantified by the asymmetry parameter q. In optics, q is usually considered as a phenomenological coefficient obtained by fitting experimental or numerical data. In this work, we introduce an ab initio Maxwellian approach using quasinormal modes to analytically describe line shapes in light scattering problems. We show that the response of each individual quasinormal mode inherently exhibits a Fano profile and derive an explicit analytical formula for the Fano parameter. Experimental and numerical validations confirm the formula's accuracy across a broad spectrum of electromagnetic systems. The general expression for q opens new possibilities for fine-tuning and optimizing spectral line shapes in electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Toward ultimate-efficiency frequency conversion in nonlinear optical microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated nonlinear photonics has emerged as a transformative platform, enabling nanoscale nonlinear optical processes with significant implications for sensing, computation, and metrology. Achieving efficient nonlinear frequency conversion in optical microresonators is paramount to fully unlocking this potential, yet the absolute conversion efficiency (ACE) of many processes, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), remains fundamentally constrained by dissipative losses and intrinsic nonlinear effects in the device. In this work, we establish a unified theoretical framework for SHG in microresonators, identifying a decisive factor M that predicts the upper limit of ACE under the nonlinear critical coupling (NCC) condition. Using this framework, we fabricate integrated periodically poled lithium niobate microresonators and address the dispersive and dissipative suppression to approach the NCC condition. We achieve a record-high experimental ACE of 61.3% with milliwatt-level pump powers toward the ultimate efficiency, with the potential for even higher efficiency as the M factor increases. These results provide a versatile paradigm for high-efficiency nonlinear optical devices, offering new opportunities for advancements across classical and quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Interface and spectrum multiplexing Ptychographic reflection microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflective ptychography is a promising lensless imaging technique with a wide field of view, offering significant potential for applications in semiconductor manufacturing and detection. However, many semiconductor materials are coated with different layers during processing, which leads to the reflected diffraction light being a coherent superposition of multiple light beams. Traditional phase recovery methods often overlook the multi-layered nature of these materials, resulting in artificial errors and, in some cases, failures in image reconstruction. This limitation has hindered the broader application and adoption of reflection ptychography. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an innovative interface and spectrum multiplexing ptychographic reflection microscopy. By employing multi-wavelength light as the illumination source, our approach enables the accurate extraction of the wavelength-dependent surface structure imaging and topography mapping of materials in a single experiment. This advancement offers a reliable technique for element-specific detection of semiconductor materials, utilizing tabletop extreme ultraviolet light sources in the future.</description>

      <title>Twist-Induced Beam Steering and Blazing Effects in Photonic Crystal Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer photonic crystals introduce a twist between two stacked photonic crystal slabs, enabling strong modulation of their electromagnetic properties. The change in the twist angle strongly influences the resonant frequencies and available propagating diffraction orders with applications including sensing, lasing, slow light or wavefront engineering. In this work, we design and analyze twisted bilayer crystals capable of steering light in a direction controlled by the twist angle. In order to achieve beam steering, the device efficiently routes input power into a single, twist-dependent, transmitted diffraction order. The outgoing light then follows the orientation of this diffraction order, externally controlled by the twist angle. The optimization is performed using high-efficiency heuristic optimization method which enabled a data-oriented approach to further understand the design operation. The optimized device demonstrates an efficiency above 90% across twist angles ranging from 0 to 30 degrees for both TE and TM polarizations. Extending the optimization to include left- and right-handed polarizations yields overall accuracy nearing 90% when averaged across the entire 0 to 60 degrees control range. Finally, we show how the device resembles blazed gratings by effectively canceling the undesired diffraction orders. The optimized devices exhibit a shared slant dependent on the selected diffraction order. Our analysis is supported by a structural blazing model arising from the data-oriented statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Optomechanically and Themo-optically driven Interactions between Gilded Vaterite Nanoparticles in Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability to tailor mutual interactions between colloidal nanoparticles strongly depends on the length scales involved. While electrostatic and optomechanically driven interactions can cover nano and micron-scale landscapes, controlling inter-particle dynamics at larger distances remains a challenge. Small physical and electromagnetic cross-sections of nanoparticles make long-range interactions, screened by a fluid environment, inefficient. To bypass the limitations, we demonstrate that forming micron-scale bubbles around gilded vaterite nanoparticles enables mediating long-range interactions via thermo-optical forces. Femtosecond laser illumination leads to the encapsulation of light-absorbing particles inside long-lasting micron-scale bubbles, which in turn behave as negative lenses refracting incident light. Our experiments reveal the bubble-induced collimation of laser beams, traversing over mm-scale distances. The collimated beams are visualized with the aid of phase-contrast Schlieren imaging, which reveals refractive index variations, caused by temperature gradients within the fluid. We demonstrate that the refracted beams initiate the formation of secondary bubbles around nearby gilded vaterite particles. As the consequence, we demonstrate the ability to control secondary bubble motion by pushing and pulling it with optical radiation pressure force and by thermocapillary Marangoni effect, respectively. The latter facilitates interactions over millimeter-scale distances, which are otherwise unachievable. Apart from exploring new physical effects, mediating long-range interactions can find a use in a range of applications including drug design and screening, photochemistry, design of colloidal suspensions, and many others.</description>

      <title>Wilson Loop and Topological Properties in 3D Woodpile Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the first and the second order topological states of electromagnetic (EM) wave in the three-dimensional (3D) woodpile photonic crystal (PhC). The recent studies on 3D PhCs have mainly focused on the observation of the topological states. Here, we not only focus on finding the topological states but also propose a numerical calculation method for topological invariants, which is based on the Wilson loop. For the 3D woodpile PhC, the topological states emerge due to the finite difference in the winding number or partial Chern number. The selection rule for the emergence of topological hinge states is also pointed out based on the topological invariants. Our numerical calculation results are essential and put a step toward the experimental realization of topological waveguide in 3D PhCs.</description>

      <title>Broadband Unidirectional Visible Imaging Using Wafer-Scale Nano-Fabrication of Multi-Layer Diffractive Optical Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a broadband and polarization-insensitive unidirectional imager that operates at the visible part of the spectrum, where image formation occurs in one direction while in the opposite direction, it is blocked. This approach is enabled by deep learning-driven diffractive optical design with wafer-scale nano-fabrication using high-purity fused silica to ensure optical transparency and thermal stability. Our design achieves unidirectional imaging across three visible wavelengths (covering red, green and blue parts of the spectrum), and we experimentally validated this broadband unidirectional imager by creating high-fidelity images in the forward direction and generating weak, distorted output patterns in the backward direction, in alignment with our numerical simulations. This work demonstrates the wafer-scale production of diffractive optical processors, featuring 16 levels of nanoscale phase features distributed across two axially aligned diffractive layers for visible unidirectional imaging. This approach facilitates mass-scale production of ~0.5 billion nanoscale phase features per wafer, supporting high-throughput manufacturing of hundreds to thousands of multi-layer diffractive processors suitable for large apertures and parallel processing of multiple tasks. Our design can seamlessly integrate into conventional optical systems, broadening its applicability in fields such as security, defense, and telecommunication. Beyond broadband unidirectional imaging in the visible spectrum, this study establishes a pathway for artificial-intelligence-enabled diffractive optics with versatile applications, signaling a new era in optical device functionality with industrial-level massively scalable fabrication.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative cathodoluminescence microscopy of beam-sensitive materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence microscopy is now a well-established and powerful tool for probing the photonic properties of nanoscale materials, but in many cases, nanophotonic materials are easily damaged by the electron-beam doses necessary to achieve reasonable cathodoluminescence signal-to-noise ratios. Two-dimensional materials have proven particularly susceptible to beam-induced modifications, yielding both obstacles to high spatial-resolution measurement and opportunities for beam-induced patterning of quantum photonic systems. Here pan-sharpening techniques are applied to cathodoluminescence microscopy in order to address these challenges and experimentally demonstrate the promise of pan-sharpening for minimally-perturbative high-spatial-resolution spectrum imaging of beam-sensitive materials.</description>

      <title>Sub-quadratic scalable approximate linear converter using multi-plane light conversion with low-entropy mode mixers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing is emerging as a promising platform for energy-efficient, high-throughput hardware in deep learning. A key challenge lies in the realization of optical matrix-vector multiplication, which often requires $O(N^2)$ phase shifters for exact synthesis of $N \times N$ matrices, limiting scalability. In this study, we propose an approximate matrix realization method using multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) that reduces both the system size and the number of phase shifters while maintaining acceptable error bounds. This approach uses low-entropy mode mixers, allowing more compact implementations compared to conventional mixers. We introduce Shannon matrix entropy as a measure of mode coupling strength in mixers and demonstrate that low-entropy mixers can preserve computational accuracy while reducing the requirements for the mixers. The approximation quality is evaluated using the maximum norm between the target and realized matrices. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves sub-quadratic scaling of phase shifters by tolerating predefined error thresholds. To identify efficient architectures for implementing general linear matrices, we compare block-encoding (BE) and singular-value decomposition (SVD) schemes for realizing general linear matrices using unitary converters based on MPLC. Results indicate that BE exhibits superior iterative configuration properties beyond the unitary group. By characterizing the trade-offs between matrix entropy, number of phase shifter layers, and the error tolerance, this study provides a framework for designing scalable and efficient approximate optical converters.</description>

      <title>Robust Characterization of Integrated Photonics Directional Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional couplers are essential components in integrated photonics. Given their widespread use, accurate characterization of directional couplers is crucial for ensuring optimal performance. However, it is challenging due to the coupling between fibers and waveguides, which is highly sensitive to alignment and fabrication imperfections. To address these challenges, we propose a novel direct measurement technique that offers greater robustness to variations in optical interfaces, while bypassing extinction ratio measurements. Our method enables a broadband and precise characterization of the directional couplers' splitting ratio. We experimentally validate this approach, demonstrate its robustness against intentional errors, and compare it to a naive direct measurement method. Furthermore, our technique is generalized to measure the amplitude of any general 2x2 unitary circuit, providing valuable insights for designing and testing a wide range of photonic integrated devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11705v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colour printing based on metallic or dielectric nanostructures has revolutionized colour science due to its unprecedented subwavelength resolution. Evidently, the evolution towards the active control of such structural colours with smart materials is in progress for real applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate a large colour gamut with high intensity and purity, as well as its switching on and off based solely on tungsten trioxide (WO3) cylindrical resonators. The strong resonances in the visible spectral range in these WO3 metasurfaces can be reversibly switched on and off due to its electrochromism by applying alternating voltages of +2.0 V and -0.3 V. Our approach opens up possibilities for the functional diversification of commercial smart windows, as well as the development of new display technologies in the future.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic microscopy with meta-optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the miniaturization of optical elements have led to the emergence of novel imaging systems, used for industrial and consumer-based applications. The underlying methods are particularly prevalent in the realms of medical imaging and optical microscopy. Avoiding bulky optical elements can be extremely beneficial to many microscopy modalities, one of which is photoacoustic microscopy. Relying on short, highly focused light pulses that need to be precisely controlled, large and heavy optical elements can often hinder the overall performance of such systems. We propose the utilization of increasingly popular optical elements, so-called meta-optics, in the excitation path of a photoacoustic microscope. The metalenses, which were designed and used for this work, consist of sub-wavelength elements that enable elaborate phase control of incident light and multifunctionality within a single optical element. This allowed us to not only replace common optical elements in the excitation path of the photoacoustic microscope, completely omitting any conventional glass elements, but also to design an adapted lens, increasing the depth of field. With our work, we prove the benefit of meta-optics for photoacoustic microscopy by comparing two different metalenses to a conventional glass lens in simulations as well as experiments. We expect this to be a step into the direction of more advanced meta-optics being utilized in photoacoustic imaging setups.</description>

      <title>On-chip Brillouin Amplifier in Suspended Lithium Niobate Nanowaveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a leading material platform for integrated nonlinear photonics, enabling transformative applications such as broadband Kerr soliton microcomb and high-speed electro-optic modulation. While stimulated Brillouin scattering has been numerically proposed in TFLN, achieving sufficient gain remains challenging due to the requirement for the simultaneous low optical and mechanical losses of the device. In this work, we systematically characterize the angle-dependence of Brillouin gain coefficients in x-cut membrane-suspended TFLN nanowaveguides, taking into account the anisotropy of the photoelastic coefficients in lithium niobate. We report a Brillouin gain coefficient of 129.5 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$ and further demonstrate the Brillouin frequency tuning through variations in either pump frequency or chip operating temperature. Based on the suspended TFLN nanowaveguide, by optimizing the confinement of both photonic and phononic modes, we have achieved a Brillouin amplifier with a record-high gain of 8.5 dB. This result not only validates the feasibility of strong guided Brillouin interaction using suspended TFLN nanowaveguides, but also paves the way for novel on-chip sensing and signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal coupled-mode analysis of dynamic gain in exceptional-point lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key features of lasers operating near exceptional points (EPs) is that the gain medium can support an oscillating population inversion above a pump threshold, leading to self-modulated laser dynamics. This unusual behavior opens up new possibilities for frequency comb generation and temporal modulation. However, the dynamic population inversion couples signals with different frequencies and thus cannot be captured by conventional temporal coupled-mode theory (TCMT) based on static saturable gain. In this paper, we develop a perturbative coupled-mode analysis framework to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of near-EP lasers. By decomposing discrete frequency generation into multiple excitations of resonant modes, our analysis establishes a minimal physical model that translates the local distribution of dynamic population-inversion into a resonant modal interpretation of laser gain. This work enables the exploration of unique properties in this self-time-modulated systems, such as time-varying scattering and non-reciprocal transmission.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Linewidth Behaviour of Narrow Optical Emitters at Sub-kelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the properties of ultra-narrow spectral holes in ensembles of solid-state emitters in crystals over a range of sub-kelvin temperatures, with a focus on their potential application in frequency stabilization schemes as an alternative to ultrastable cavities. We investigate how the parameters used to burn the spectral hole impact its shape, and how these factors determine the minimum achievable linewidth. In addition to the stability of the hole's center frequency, the linewidth and contrast play a crucial role in frequency locking. At sub-kelvin temperatures, the temperaturedependent T^7 broadening from two-phonon Raman scattering is expected to be negligible, and the spectral hole's linewidth should therefore remain constant in this interval. We observe however a linear broadening with increasing temperature, highlighting the need for further investigation into the mechanisms governing the linewidth at ultra-low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Line shape of soft photon radiation generated at zero angle in an undulator with a dispersive medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of undulator radiation from a bunch of charged particles, taking into account a medium polarization, is considered. In a dispersive medium, at a zero angle, in addition to hard photons, soft photons are also generated. If the wavelength of the soft photons is greater than or equal to the longitudinal size of the microbunches formed during the FEL process, the microbunches radiate coherently. Consequently, the radiation of the bunch will be partially coherent. As a result, intense, quasi-monochromatic, and directed X-ray photon beams are produced, which can have wide practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minkowski vacuum is empty from the perspective of Unruh-Minkowski photons, however, in the Rindler picture, it is filled with entangled pairs of Rindler photons. A ground-state atom uniformly accelerated through Minkowski vacuum can become excited by absorbing a Rindler photon (Unruh effect) or, in the alternative description, by emitting an Unruh-Minkowski photon (Unruh-Wald effect). We find an exact solution for the quantum evolution of a long chain of harmonic oscillators accelerated through Minkowski vacuum and for two chains accelerated in the opposite directions. We show how entanglement of Rindler photons present in Minkowski vacuum is transferred to the oscillators moving in causally disconnected regions. We also show that in the Unruh-Minkowski photon picture the process can be interpreted as if initial correlations between collective oscillator modes are transferred to the generated Unruh-Minkowski photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a technique for calculation the density operator time evolution along the lines of Heisenberg representation of quantum mechanics. Using this technique, we find the exact solution for the evolution of two and three coupled harmonic oscillators initially prepared in thermal states at different temperatures. We show that such systems exhibit interesting quantum dynamics in which oscillators swap their thermal states due to entanglement induced in the process of energy exchange and yield noise induced coherence. A photonic quantum heat engine (QHE) composed of two optical cavities can be modeled as coupled harmonic oscillators with time-dependent frequencies. Photons in the cavities become entangled during the engine operation. We show that the work done by such an engine is maximum if at the end of the cycle the oscillators swap numbers of excitations which can be achieved when the engine operates under the condition of parametric resonance. We also show that Carnot formula yields limiting efficiency for QHEs under general assumptions. Our results deepen understanding of quantum evolution of mixed states which could be useful to design quantum machines with a better performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are renowned for their high brightness, significantly impacting biology, chemistry, and nonlinear X-ray optics. However, current XFELs are large, expensive, and exhibit significant shot-to-shot instability. Here, we propose a novel compact apparatus for generating X-ray lasers. The setup integrates an ion source to produce highly charged ions as the gain medium. The X-ray optical cavity employs crystal Bragg diffraction for high reflectivity at large angles, and two parabolic compound refractive lenses (CRLs) focus the X-rays. Pumping is achieved through electron collision excitations. This X-ray laser offers compact dimensions, reduced costs, and enhanced coherence, positioning it as a promising seed for XFELs. With further optimization, this device has the potential to rival XFELs and revolutionize both scientific research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Irradiation-driven Evaporation of Micro Droplets in an Optical Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small droplets are irradiated with visible and infrared light in many natural and industrial environments. One of the simplest ways to describe their evaporation is the D$^2$-Law. It states that the evaporation rate is proportional to $t^{-1/2}$, and $R^{-1}$. However, models like the D$^2$-Law do not account for the volumetric heating of light and the effect of strong irradiation on individual droplets is not fully understood. Here we show the effects of IR irradiation on optically levitated water droplets. We find that, under strong irradiation of up to $10^8 W/m^2$, the droplet evaporation is initially driven by the heat from the laser following the power law $dR / dt \sim R$, i.e. the inverse of the D$^2$-Law. Then, when the droplets shrink to 2 - 3 $\mu$m in radius a turnover occurs from irradiation-driven back to diffusion-driven evaporation. Our findings support the understanding of droplet evaporation in cases such as rocket engines or internal combustion, where the radiation from the flame will heat water and fuel droplets.</description>

Abstract: Development of experimental techniques at nanoscale resulted in ability to perform spectroscopic measurements on single-molecule current carrying junctions. These experiments are natural meeting point for research fields of optical spectroscopy and molecular electronics. We present a pedagogical comparison between perturbation theory expansion of standard nonlinear optical spectroscopy and (non-self-consistent) perturbative diagrammatic formulation of the nonequilibrium Green's functions method (NEGF is widely used in molecular electronics) indicating their similarities and differences. Comparing the two approaches we argue that optical spectroscopy of open quantum systems has to be analyzed within the more general Green's function formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured optical fields have led to several ground-breaking techniques in classical imaging and microscopy. At the same time, in the quantum domain, position-momentum entangled photon fields have been shown to have several unique features that can lead to beyond-classical imaging and microscopy capabilities. Therefore, it is natural to expect that position-momentum entangled two-photon fields that are structured can push the boundaries of quantum imaging and microscopy even further beyond. Nonetheless, the existing experimental schemes are able to produce either structured two-photon fields without position-momentum entanglement, or position-momentum entangled two-photon fields without structures. In this article, by manipulating the phase-matching condition of the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process, we report experimental generation of two-photon fields with various structures in their spatial correlations. We experimentally measure the minimum bound on the entanglement of formation and thereby verify the position-momentum entanglement of the structured two-photon field. We expect this work to have important implications for quantum technologies related to imaging and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider relativistic versions of the Ehrenfest relation between the expectation values of the coordinate and momentum of a quantum particle in free space: $d\langle {\bf r} \rangle /dt = \langle {\bf p} \rangle/m$. We find that the simple proportionality between the mean velocity and momentum holds true only for the simplest quadratic dispersion (i.e., dependence of the energy on the momentum). For relativistic dispersion, the mean velocity is generally not collinear with the mean momentum, but velocity of the {\it energy centroid} is directed along the mean momentum. This is related to the conservation of the Lorentz-boost momentum and has implications in possible decomposition of the mean orbital angular momentum into intrinsic and extrinsic parts. Neglecting spin/polarization effects, these properties depend solely on the dispersion relation, and can be applied to any waves, including classical electromagnetic or acoustic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate~(LN) is a birefringent material, where the strong birefringence thermo-optic effect is promising for the generation of quantum photon source with widely tunable wavelength. Here, we demonstrate birefringent phase-matching in a 20-mm-long waveguide fabricated on 5~$\mu$m-thick x-cut lithium niobate on insulator. The waveguide is deviated from the optical axis of LN by an angle of 53.5$^\circ$, enabling the phase matching between telecom and visible wavelengths. The phase-matching wavelength of this device can be thermally tuned with rate of 0.617~nm/K. We demonstrate the type-1 spontaneous parametric down-conversion to generate photon pairs with brightness of 2.2~MHz/mW and coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to $2.8\times10^5$. Furthermore, the heralded single photon is obtained from the photon pair with efficiency of 13.8\% and count rate up to 37.8~kHz.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency On-chip Quantum Photon Source in Modal Phase-matched Lithium Niobate Nanowaveguide</title>

Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate on insulator~(LNOI) emerges as a promising platform for integrated quantum photon source, enabling scalable on-chip quantum information processing. The most popular technique to overcome the phase mismatching between interacting waves in waveguide is periodic poling, which is intrinsically sensitive to poling uniformity. Here, we report an alternative strategy to offset the phase mismatching of spontaneous parametric down-conversion~(SPDC) process, so-called modal phase matching, in a straight waveguide fabricated on a dual-layer LNOI. The dual-layer LNOI consists of two 300~nm lithium niobates with opposite directions, which significantly enhances the spatial overlap between fundamental and high-order modes and thus enables efficient SPDC. This dual-layer waveguide generates photon pairs with pair generation rate of 41.77~GHz/mW, which exhibits excellent signal-to-noise performance with coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 58298$\pm$1297. Moreover, we observe a heralded single-photon source with second-order autocorrelation $g_{H}^{(2)}(0)&lt;0.2$ and heralded rate exceeding 100~kHz. Our results provide an experiment-friendly approach for efficient generation of quantum photon sources and benefit the on-chip quantum information processing based on LNOI.</description>

      <title>The focusing complex mKdV equation with nonzero background: Large $N$-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons and related Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the large-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons of the focusing complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (c-mKdV) equation with nonzero background via the Riemann-Hilbert problems. First, based on the Lax pair, inverse scattering transform, and a series of deformations, we construct a multi-rational soliton of the c-mKdV equation via a solvable Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP). Then, through a scale transformation, we construct a RHP corresponding to the limit function which is a new solution of the c-mKdV equation in the rescaled variables $X,\,T$, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the RHP's solution. Moreover, we also find that the limit function satisfies the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to space $X$ and time $T$, respectively. The ODEs with respect to space $X$ are identified with certain members of the Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy. We study the large $X$ and transitional asymptotic behaviors of near-field limit solutions, and we provide some part results for the case of large $T$. These results will be useful to understand and apply the large-order rational solitons in the nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond phase-space correlations in few-particle photoelectron pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions impose fundamental limits on the brightness of continuous and pulsed electron beams. When multiple electrons leave a field emitter within a space-time volume of femtoseconds and nanometers, their mutual repulsion creates well-defined correlations in energy and time. Such correlations remain undetected in ensemble measurements that average over the statistics of the emission process. Here, we employ event-based and femtosecond-gated detection of photoelectron states to map Coulomb-correlated few-particle phase-space distributions. Inelastic electron-light scattering experiments performed on two-electron states reveal a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space. Reconstructing the phase-space density, we find an overall energy-time dispersion that is distinct from that of the two separated sub-ensembles forming the bimodal distribution. Our findings disentangle correlation-induced and dispersive contributions to the energy-time structure of few-electron pulses and promote future electron microscopy schemes enhanced by multi-electron states.</description>

      <title>Uniform response theory of non-Hermitian systems: Non-Hermitian physics beyond the exceptional point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display remarkable response effects that reflect a variety of distinct spectral scenarios, such as exceptional points where the eigensystem becomes defective. However, present frameworks treat the different scenarios as separate cases, following the singular mathematical change between the spectral decompositions from one scenario to another. This not only complicates the coherent description near the spectral singularities where the response qualitatively changes, but also impedes the application to practical systems. Here we develop a general response theory of non-Hermitian systems that uniformly applies across all spectral scenarios. We unravel this response by formulating uniform expansions of the spectral quantization condition and Green's function, where both expansions exclusively involve directly calculable data from the Hamiltonian. This data smoothly varies with external parameters as spectral singularities are approached, and nevertheless captures the qualitative differences of the response in these scenarios. We furthermore present two direct applications of this framework. Firstly, we determine the precise conditions for spectral degeneracies of geometric multiplicity greater than unity, as well as the perturbative behavior around these cases. Secondly, we formulate a hierarchy of spectral response strengths that varies continuously across all parameter space, and thereby also reliably determines the response strength of exceptional points. Finally, we demonstrate both generally and in concrete examples that the previously inaccessible scenarios of higher geometric multiplicity result in unique variants of super-Lorentzian response. Our approach widens the scope of non-Hermitian response theory to capture all spectral scenarios on an equal and uniform footing.</description>

      <title>Molecular tuning of excitons and polarization anisotropy in hybrid bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, built from monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals with different lattice orientations, generate interlayer potentials leading to unique excitonic properties. However, the ability to tune the interlayer potential is limited by the fixed covalent 2D lattice geometries. Synthetically substituting one of the layers with an atomically thin molecular crystal could substantially expand the design space for tuning the excitonic response, enabled by explicit control of chemical and electronic structures of the molecular building blocks. Here we report the large-scale synthesis of four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), comprising perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer single crystals, which show precise tuning of the HBC lattices at the molecular level. We observe near-unity anisotropic photoluminescence, which is directly tuned by specific molecular geometry and HBC composition. Our ab initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations show that the anisotropic emission originates from delocalized and anisotropic hybrid excitons. These excitons inherit characteristics from states associated with both the TMD and molecular layers, resulting from a hybridized bilayer band structure of the HBC. By introducing HBCs as a scalable solid-state platform, our work paves the way for tunable interlayer energy landscapes achievable through direct synthesis, opening up new frontiers in molecule-based quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Freeform Metasurfaces: A Platform for Advanced Broadband Dispersion Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, with their ability to control electromagnetic waves, hold immense potential in optical device design, especially for applications requiring precise control over dispersion. This work introduces an approach to dispersion engineering using heterogeneous freeform metasurfaces, which overcomes the limitations of conventional metasurfaces that often suffer from poor transmission, narrow bandwidth, and restricted polarization responses. By transitioning from single-layer, canonical meta-atoms to bilayer architectures with non-intuitive geometries, our design decouples intrinsic material properties (refractive index and group index), enabling independent engineering of phase and group delays as well as higher-order dispersion properties, while achieving high-efficiency under arbitrary polarization states. We implement a two-stage multi-objective optimization process to generate libraries of meta-atoms, which are then utilized for the rapid design of dispersion-engineered metasurfaces. Additionally, we present a bilayer metasurface stacking technique, paving the way for the realization of high-performance, dispersion-engineered optical devices. Our approach is validated through the demonstration of metasurfaces exhibiting superior chromatic aberration correction and broadband performance, with over 81% averaged efficiency across the 420-nm visible-to-near-infrared bandwidth. Our synergistic combination of advanced design physics, powerful freeform optimization methods, and bi-layer nanofabrication techniques represents a significant breakthrough compared to the state-of-the-art while opening new possibilities for broadband metasurface applications.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Strain Tuning of Er3+ in Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Er3+ color centers are promising candidates for quantum science and technology due to their long electron and nuclear spin coherence times, as well as their desirable emission wavelength. By selecting host materials with suitable, controllable properties, we introduce new parameters that can be used to tailor the Er3+ emission spectrum. PbTiO3 is a well-studied ferroelectric material with known methods of engineering different domain configurations through epitaxial strain. By distorting the structure of Er3+-doped PbTiO3 thin films, we can manipulate the crystal fields around the Er3+ dopant. This is resolved through changes in the Er3+ resonant fluorescence spectra, tying the optical properties of the defect directly to the domain configurations of the ferroelectic matrix. Additionally, we are able to resolve a second set of peaks for films with in-plane ferroelectric polarization. We hypothesize these results to be due to either the Er3+ substituting different sites of the PbTiO3 crystal, differences in charges between the Er3+ dopant and the original substituent ion, or selection rules. Systematically studying the relationship between the Er3+ emission and the epitaxial strain of the ferroelectric matrix lays the pathway for future optical studies of spin manipulation by altering ferroelectric order parameters</description>

Abstract: Compensation of the generalized spherical aberration components is discussed for the plane-symmetric and anamorphic optical systems. An example compensation rules are derived for the double-plane symmetric optical system containing reflective and refractive subsystems, which focus light in the orthogonal directions at the image plane. An economical anamorphic extension of the Cassegrain-type cylindrical mirror system has been simulated with a ray-tracing code. Anamorphic telescopes of the introduced type provide independent focal distances in the two orthogonal planes allowing to set up a favorable field of view.</description>

Abstract: An optical frequency comb comprises a cluster of equally spaced, phase-locked spectral lines. Replacing these classical components with correlated quantum light gives rise to cluster quantum frequency combs, providing abundant quantum resources for measurement-based quantum computation and multi-user quantum networks. We propose and generate cluster quantum microcombs within an on-chip optical microresonator driven by multi-frequency lasers. Through resonantly enhanced four-wave mixing processes, continuous-variable cluster states with 60 qumodes are deterministically created. The graph structures can be programmed into one- and two-dimensional lattices by adjusting the configurations of the pump lines, which are confirmed inseparable based on the measured covariance matrices. Our work demonstrates the largest-scale cluster states with unprecedented raw squeezing levels from a photonic chip, offering a compact and scalable platform for computational and communicational tasks with quantum advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescence collection from individual emitters plays a key role in state detection and remote entanglement generation, fundamental functionalities in many quantum platforms. Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize two diffractive collection elements operating at $\lambda=397$ nm; a forward emitting design is predicted to offer 0.25% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode, while a more efficient reverse-emitting design offers $1.14\%$ collection efficiency, albeit with more demanding fabrication requirements. Close agreement between simulated and measured emission for both designs indicates practicality of these collection efficiencies, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams. We point out a particularly simple integrated waveguide configuration for polarization-based remote entanglement generation enabled by integrated collection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on time crystals concerns the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in time, as well as the realization of phenomena and phases known from solid-state physics in the time domain. Periodically driven systems of massive particles are widely used in these studies. In the present work, we consider a photonic system and demonstrate that stable nonlinear propagation of a strong optical wave in a fiber leads to the establishment of quasi-periodic oscillations in the electromagnetic field intensity. A second, weaker signal optical wave propagating in the fiber senses these oscillations and, as a result, undergoes exponential localization in time. This is a temporal analogue of Aubry-Andre localization. If an optical detector is placed at a certain position in the fiber, the temporal localization of the probe wave will be observed in the form of the signal which emerges and then decays as a function of time.</description>

Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the effective indices of modes of circular step-index fibers valid near their cutoff wavelengths. The approximation, being a first-order Taylor series of a smooth function, is also valid for the real part of the effective index beyond cutoff where the modes become lossy. The approximation is used to derive certain previously unknown mode properties. For example, it is shown that for non-dispersive materials the EH-mode group index at cutoff, surprisingly, does not depend on wavelength, core radius, or even radial mode order.</description>

Abstract: We present an innovative, platform-independent concept for multiparameter sensing where the measurable parameters are in series, or cascaded, enabling measurements as a function of position. With temporally resolved detection, we show that squeezing can give a quantum enhancement in sensitivity over that of classical states by a factor of $e^{2r}$, where $r \approx 1$ is the squeezing parameter. As an example, we have modeled an interferometer that senses multiple phase shifts along the same path, demonstrating a maximal quantum advantage by combining a coherent state with squeezed vacuum. Further classical modeling with up to 100 phases shows linear scaling potential for adding nodes to the sensor. The approach represents a new paradigm in multiparameter quantum metrology, and can be applied to remote sensing, geophysical surveying, and infrastructure monitoring.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequency Mixing using an N-$V$ Diamond Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07025</link>

Abstract: Wide-field magnetic microscopy using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can yield high-quality magnetic images of DC and AC magnetic fields. The unique combination of micron-scale spatial resolution of scalar or vector fields at room temperature and parallel camera readout make this an appealing technique for applications in biology, geology, condensed-matter physics, and electronics. However, while NV magnetic microscopy has achieved great success in these areas, historically the accessible frequency range has been limited. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by implementing the recently developed technique of quantum frequency mixing. With this approach, we generate wide-field magnetic images of test structures driven by alternating currents up to 70 MHz, well outside the reach of DC and Rabi magnetometry methods. With further improvements, this approach could find utility in hyperspectral imaging for electronics power spectrum analysis, electronics diagnostics and troubleshooting, and quantum computing hardware validation.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

      <title>Theory of the monochromatic advanced-wave picture and applications in biphoton optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02088</link>

Abstract: Klyshko's advanced-wave picture (AWP) is mainly interpreted by replacing the nonlinear crystal producing biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) by a mirror in quantum imaging protocols with thin crystals, where the biphotons are perfectly correlated in position at the crystal. To better explain the biphoton spatial states produced by arbitrary crystals and pump beams, we develop a formal theory of AWP with monochromatic lights that the conditional wave function of one photon is calculated by propagation, multiplication, and another propagation. The case of more general photon postselection or no detection and the inclusion of polarization are studied. Then, we explain the form of the biphoton state from SPDC with a bulk crystal and its free-space propagation. By treating the biphoton wave function as an impulse response function of a classical optical setup, we analyze quantum imaging with undetected photons and quantum holography with polarization entanglement, where properties like the spatial resolution can be concisely deduced. This method can be employed to design nonlinear materials or novel quantum imaging techniques. Finally, we discuss Klyshko's original proposal beyond monochromatic lights with the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect as an example.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensitivity of parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02887</link>

Abstract: Many quantum systems exhibit high sensitivity to their initial conditions, where microscopic quantum fluctuations can significantly influence macroscopic observables. Understanding how quantum states may influence the behavior of nonlinear dynamic systems may open new avenues in controlling light-matter interactions. To explore this issue, we analyze the sensitivity of a fundamental quantum optical process - parametric oscillation - to quantum initializations. Focusing on optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), we demonstrate that the quantum statistics of arbitrary initial states are imprinted in the early-stage dynamics and can persist in the steady-state probabilities. We derive the "quantum sensitivity" of parametric oscillators, linking the initial quantum state to the system's steady-state outcomes, highlighting how losses and parametric gain govern the system's quantum sensitivity. Moreover, we show that these findings extend beyond OPOs to a broader class of nonlinear systems, including Josephson junction based superconducting circuits. Our work opens the way to a new class of experiments that can test the sensitivity of macroscopic systems to quantum initial conditions and offers a pathway for controlling systems with quantum degrees of freedom.</description>
