      <title>Irreversible Failure Reverses the Value of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamic games with hidden states and absorbing failure, where belief-driven actions can trigger irreversible collapse. In such environments, equilibria that sustain activity generically operate at the boundary of viability. We show that this geometry endogenously reverses the value of information: greater informational precision increases the probability of collapse on every finite horizon. We formalize this mechanism through a limit-viability criterion, and model opacity as a strategic choice of the information structure via Blackwell garbling. When failure is absorbing, survival values become locally concave in beliefs, implying that transparency destroys equilibrium viability while sufficient opacity restores it. In an extended game where agents choose the information structure ex ante, strictly positive opacity is necessary for equilibrium survival. The results identify irreversible failure--not coordination, misspecification, or ambiguity--as a primitive force generating an endogenous demand for opacity in dynamic games.</description>

      <title>The Global Food Trade Network as a Complex Adaptive System: A Review of Structure, Evolution, and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global food system has metamorphosed from a loose aggregation of bilateral exchanges into a highly intricate, interdependent Global Food Trade Network (FTN). This comprehensive review synthesizes the extant literature to examine the FTN through the rigorous lens of complex network science, moving beyond traditional economic trade models to quantify the system's topological architecture. We delineate the network's historical transition from a unipolar, efficiency-driven system dominated by Western hegemony to a multipolar, regionalized structure characterized by high clustering and scale-free heterogeneity. Special emphasis is placed on the dual nature of connectivity, which functions simultaneously as a buffer against local production variances and a conduit for global contagion. By conceptualizing the FTN as a multiplex system-distinguishing between the robust topology of wheat, the brittle regionalism of rice, and the polarized "dumbbell" structure of soy-we elucidate the distinct structural vulnerabilities inherent in modern food security. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of recent high-magnitude shocks, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, illustrating the critical trade-off between logistical efficiency and systemic resilience. The review concludes by assessing the future trajectory of the network under anthropogenic climate change, predicting a poleward migration of comparative advantage that necessitates a paradigm shift from isolationist protectionism to cooperative network redundancy.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Concavity, Convexity of Optimal Actions, and the Local Single-Crossing Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents two results. First, it shows that under mild conditions, a decision problem is quasi-concave if the set of optimal actions is convex under every belief. Second, it shows that if a decision problem is quasi-concave, then it satisfies the local single crossing property after relabeling the states.</description>

      <title>The accumulation of knowledge with intra-industry knowledge spillovers: A competition game and the Nash equilibrium based on firm cost minimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a competition game whose key variables are the R&amp;D efforts (e.g. R&amp;D expenditures) and accumulated knowledge of firms located in a specific region. The most significant element of accumulated knowledge is knowledge spillovers. These are considered intra-industry as it is assumed that the firms operate within the same industry (i.e. similar types of firms) and competitors offer similar products. The present study identifies a Nash equilibrium based on firm cost minimisation. This is derived under the assumption that the firms under examination act rationally and are primarily concerned with achieving optimal outcomes - specifically, by minimising their total costs.</description>

      <title>Accelerator and Brake: Dynamic Persuasion with Dead Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal dynamic persuasion in a bandit experimentation model where a principal, unlike in standard settings, has a single-peaked preference over the agent's stopping time. This non-monotonic preference arises because maximizing the agent's effort is not always in the principal's best interest, as it may lead to a dead end. The principal privately observes the agent's payoff upon success and uses the information as the instrument of incentives. We show that the optimal dynamic information policy involves at most two one-shot disclosures: an accelerator before the principal's optimal stopping time, persuading the agent to be optimistic, and a brake after the principal's optimal stopping time, persuading the agent to be pessimistic. A key insight of our analysis is that the optimal disclosure pattern -- whether gradual or one-shot -- depends on how the principal resolves a trade-off between the mean of stopping times and its riskiness. We identify the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk aversion as a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal disclosure structure.</description>

      <title>Settling the Score: Portioning with Cardinal Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15586v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a portioning setting in which a public resource such as time or money is to be divided among a given set of candidates, and each agent proposes a division of the resource. We consider two families of aggregation rules for this setting -- those based on coordinate-wise aggregation and those that optimize some notion of welfare -- as well as the recently proposed independent markets rule. We provide a detailed analysis of these rules from an axiomatic perspective, both for classic axioms, such as strategyproofness and Pareto optimality, and for novel axioms, some of which aim to capture proportionality in this setting. Our results indicate that a simple rule that computes the average of the proposals satisfies many of our axioms and fares better than all other considered rules in terms of fairness properties. We complement these results by presenting two characterizations of the average rule.</description>

      <title>The Cost of EFX: Generalized-Mean Welfare and Complexity Dichotomies with Few Surplus Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is a central fairness notion for allocating indivisible goods, yet its existence is unresolved in general. In the setting with few surplus items, where the number of goods exceeds the number of agents by a small constant (at most three), EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist, shifting the focus from existence to efficiency and computation. We study how EFX interacts with generalized-mean ($p$-mean) welfare, which subsumes commonly-studied utilitarian ($p=1$), Nash ($p=0$), and egalitarian ($p \rightarrow -\infty$) objectives. We establish sharp complexity dichotomies at $p=0$: for any fixed $p \in (0,1]$, both deciding whether EFX can attain the global $p$-mean optimum and computing an EFX allocation maximizing $p$-mean welfare are NP-hard, even with at most three surplus goods; in contrast, for any fixed $p \leq 0$, we give polynomial-time algorithms that optimize $p$-mean welfare within the space of EFX allocations and efficiently certify when EFX attains the global optimum. We further quantify the welfare loss of enforcing EFX via the price of fairness framework, showing that for $p &gt; 0$, the loss can grow linearly with the number of agents, whereas for $p \leq 0$, it is bounded by a constant depending on the surplus (and for Nash welfare it vanishes asymptotically). Finally we show that requiring Pareto-optimality alongside EFX is NP-hard (and becomes $\Sigma_2^P$-complete for a stronger variant of EFX). Overall, our results delineate when EFX is computationally costly versus structurally aligned with welfare maximization in the setting with few surplus items.</description>

      <title>Modelling viable supply networks with cooperative adaptive financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a financial liquidity policy sharing method for firm-to-firm supply networks, introducing a scalable autonomous control function for viable complex adaptive supply networks. Cooperation and competition in supply chains is reconciled through overlapping collaborative sets, making firms interdependent and enabling distributed risk governance. How cooperative range - visibility - affects viability is studied using dynamic complex adaptive systems modelling. We find that viability needs cooperation; visibility and viability grow together in scale-free supply networks; and distributed control, where firms only have limited partner information, outperforms centralised control. This suggests that policy toward network viability should implement distributed supply chain financial governance, supporting interfirm collaboration, to enable autonomous control.</description>

      <title>Collective intelligence in science: direct elicitation of diverse information from experts with unknown information structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose we need a deep collective analysis of an open scientific problem: there is a complex scientific hypothesis and a large online group of mutually unrelated experts with relevant private information of a diverse and unpredictable nature. This information may be results of experts' individual experiments, original reasoning of some of them, results of AI systems they use, etc. We propose a simple mechanism based on a self-resolving play-money prediction market entangled with a chat. We show that such a system can easily be brought to an equilibrium where participants directly share their private information on the hypothesis through the chat and trade as if the market were resolved in accordance with the truth of the hypothesis. This approach will lead to efficient aggregation of relevant information in a completely interpretable form even if the ground truth cannot be established and experts initially know nothing about each other and cannot perform complex Bayesian calculations. Finally, by rewarding the experts with some real assets proportionally to the play money they end up with, we can get an innovative way to fund large-scale collaborative studies of any type.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Saving under Risk Preference Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that wealthy households have substantially higher saving rates and markedly lower marginal propensity to consume (MPC) than other groups. Existing theory cannot account for this pattern unless under restrictive assumptions on returns, discounting, and preferences. This paper develops a general theory of optimal savings with preference shocks, allowing risk aversion to vary across states and over time, and shows that incorporating such heterogeneity in risk attitudes fundamentally reshapes the asymptotic dynamics of consumption and saving. In particular, zero asymptotic MPCs (100% asymptotic saving rates) arise under markedly weaker conditions than in existing theory. Strikingly, such outcomes occur whenever there is a positive probability that agents become less risk averse in the future. Therefore, the vanishing MPC emerges as a generic feature rather than a knife-edge result of the optimal savings model, offering a more theoretically robust and empirically consistent account of the saving behavior of wealthy households.</description>

      <title>Sectorial Exclusion Criteria in the Marxist Analysis of the Average Rate of Profit: The United States Case (1960-2020)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long term estimation of the Marxist average rate of profit does not adhere to a theoretically grounded standard regarding which economic activities should or should not be included for such purposes, which is relevant because methodological non uniformity can be a significant source of overestimation or underestimation, generating a less accurate reflection of the capital accumulation dynamics. This research aims to provide a standard Marxist decision criterion regarding the inclusion and exclusion of economic activities for the calculation of the Marxist average profit rate for the case of United States economic sectors from 1960 to 2020, based on the Marxist definition of productive labor, its location in the circuit of capital, and its relationship with the production of surplus value. Using wavelet transformed Daubechies filters with increased symmetry, empirical mode decomposition, Hodrick Prescott filter embedded in unobserved components model, and a wide variety of unit root tests the internal theoretical consistency of the presented criteria is evaluated. Also, the objective consistency of the theory is evaluated by a dynamic factor autoregressive model, Principal Component Analysis via Singular Value Decomposition, and regularized Horseshoe regression. The results are consistent both theoretically and econometrically with the logic of Classical Marxist political economy.</description>
