      <title>Field-enhancement and nonlocal effects in epsilon-near-zero photonic gap antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the large electric field enhancement and tight spatial confinement supported by the so-called epsilon near-zero (ENZ) mode has attracted significant attention for the realization of efficient nonlinear optical devices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate ENZ photonic gap antennas (PGAs), which consist of a dielectric pillar within which a thin slab of indium tin oxide (ITO) material is embedded. In ENZ PGAs, hybrid dielectric-ENZ modes emerge from strong coupling between the dielectric antenna modes and the ENZ bulk plasmon resonance. These hybrid modes efficiently couple to free space and allow for large enhancements of the incident electric field over nearly an octave bandwidth, without the stringent lateral nanofabrication requirements of conventional plasmonic or dielectric nanoantennas. To understand the modal features, we probe the linear response of single ENZ PGAs with dark field scattering and interpret the results in terms of a simple coupled oscillator framework. Third harmonic generation (THG) is used to probe the ITO local fields and large enhancements are observed in the THG efficiency over a broad spectral range. Surprisingly, sharp peaks emerge on top of the nonlinear response, which were not predicted by full wave calculations. These peaks are attributed to the ENZ material's nonlocal response, which once included using a hydrodynamic model for the ITO permittivity improves the agreement of our calculations for both the linear and nonlinear response. This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of ENZ PGAs, which we have previously shown can support electric field enhancements of up to 100--200X, and the importance of including nonlocal effects when describing the response of thin ENZ layers. Importantly, inclusion of the ITO nonlocality leads to increases in the predicted field enhancement, as compared to the local calculation.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Double-hole Bull's Eye Nano-antenna for Far-field Polarization Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic polarization conversion offers significant advantages over conventional methods, including a smaller device footprint and easier integration into photonic circuits. In this work, we numerically and experimentally investigate the polarization conversion properties of a plasmonic double-hole structure surrounded by circular nanograting, i.e., a bull's eye antenna. Using a combination of polarimetric imaging via back focal plane (BFP) microscopy and the Stokes parameter analysis, we demonstrate the functionality of our structure as a miniature on chip polarization converter. Our results show that this nanostructure enables complex polarization transformations, including converting linear to circular polarization and vice versa. The polarization conversion efficiency is found to be dependent on the periodicity of the circular gratings and is particularly pronounced in the central region of the Fourier space. Moreover, the strong asymmetric scattering leads to distinctive patterns in the Stokes parameters across various incident polarization states. This work provides insights into the plasmonic manipulation of light polarization at the nanoscale, with potential applications in miniature on-chip polarization convertors, polarization-controlled emitters, and advanced sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>High Contrast Nulling in Photonic Meshes Through Architectural Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a silicon photonic architecture comprised of Double Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (DMZIs) designed for high-contrast photonic applications. This configuration significantly enhances the achievable extinction ratio of photonic integrated circuits (PICs), reaching levels exceeding 80 dB. By leveraging the tunable properties of DMZIs and implementing a systematic configuration algorithm, the proposed mesh effectively compensates for fabrication imperfections and mitigates non-idealities such as back reflections. Experimental validation on a silicon-on-insulator platform demonstrates the potential of this approach for applications requiring high contrast nulling such as astronomical sensing.</description>

      <title>Gigahertz-Frequency, Acousto-Optic Phase Modulation of Visible Light in a CMOS-Fabricated Photonic Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present an efficient, visible-light, gigahertz-frequency acousto-optic modulator fabricated on a 200 mm wafer in a volume CMOS foundry. Our device combines a piezoelectric transducer and a photonic waveguide within a single microstructure that confines both a propagating optical mode and an electrically excitable breathing-mode mechanical resonance. By tuning the device's geometry to optimize the optomechanical interaction, we achieve modulation depths exceeding 2 rad with 15 mW applied microwave power at 2.31 GHz in a 2 mm long device. This corresponds to a modulation figure of merit of $V_{\pi}\cdot L$ = 0.26 Vcm in a visible-light, integrated acousto-optics platform that can be straightforwardly extended to a wide range of optical wavelengths and modulation frequencies. For the important class of gigahertz-frequency modulators that can handle hundreds of milliwatts of visible-light optical power, which are critical for scalable quantum control systems, this represents a 15x decrease in $V_{\pi}$ and a 100x decrease in required microwave power compared to the commercial state-of-the-art and existing work in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An apparatus that records the optical spectrum of emissive materials as a function of the polar coordinate angles is reported. The ability for the device to characterize the directivity of a light source over the optical spectrum is demonstrated. The angular dependence of an electrically-driven LED with a hemispherical diffuser cap was characterized. Optically pumped materials that emitted both fluorescence and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) were also characterized.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Laser Driven Terahertz Surface Plasmon Polaritons on Long Metal Wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a novel scheme for efficiently generating intense terahertz (THz) surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on a sub-wavelength-diameter meter-long metal wire. Driven by a subrelativistic femtosecond laser (a0=0.3, 3 mJ) focused at the wire's midpoint, single-cycle ten-megawatt THz SPPs are excited and propagating bidirectionally along it over 25 cm. The measured laser-to-SPPs energy conversion efficiency is reaching up to ~2.4%, which is the highest value at present. It is proved that the THz SPPs are excited by coherent transition radiation of the subrelativistic laser produced escaping electrons. Particle-in-cell together with CST simulations confirm the experimental observations. Our scheme of using readily available subrelativistic laser should thus be useful to applications requiring terawatt level single-cycle THz SPPs.</description>

      <title>Radiometric Temperature Measurement for Metal Additive Manufacturing via Temperature Emissivity Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission of blackbody emission from the meltpool and surrounding area in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) makes this process visible to a range of optical monitoring instruments intended for online process and quality control. Yet, these instruments have yet to prove capable of reliably detecting the finest flaws that influence LPBF component mechanical performance, limiting their adoption. One hindrance lies in interpreting measurements of radiance as temperature, despite the physical link between these variables being readily understood as a combination of Plank's Law and spectral emissivity. Uncertainty in spectral emissivity arises as it is nearly impossible to predict and can be a strong function of wavelength; in turn, this manifests uncertainty in estimated temperatures and thereby obscures the LPBF process dynamics that indicate component defects. This paper presents temperature emissivity separation (TES) as a method for accurate retrieval of optically-measured temperatures in LPBF. TES simultaneously calculates both temperature and spectral emissivity from spectrally-resolved radiance measurements and, as the latter term is effectively measured, more accurate process temperatures result. Using a bespoke imaging spectrometer integrated with an LPBF testbed to evaluate this approach, three basic TES algorithms are compared in a validation experiment that demonstrates retrieval of temperatures accurate to $\pm 28$ K over a $1000$ K range. A second investigation proves industrial feasibility through fabrication of an LPBF test artifact. Temperature data are used to study the evolution of fusion process boundary conditions, including a decrease in cooling rate as layerwise printing proceeds. A provisional correlation of temperature fields to component porosity assessed by 3D computed tomography demonstrates in situ optical detection of micron-scale porous defects in LPBF.</description>

      <title>Mechano-optical metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable metasurfaces enable active and on-demand control over optical wavefronts through reconfigurable scattering of resonant nanostructures. Here, we present novel insights inspired by mechanical metamaterials to achieve giant tunability in mechano-optical metasurfaces where the mechanical metamaterial and optical metasurfaces are integrated in a single nanopatterned material. In a first design, judiciously engineered cuts in a flexible substrate enable large, strain-induced extension of the inter-particle spacing, tuning a high quality-factor resonance in a silicon nanoparticle array across a very broad spectral range. In a second design, we eliminate the substrate and demonstrate a nanopatterned silicon membrane that simultaneously functions as a mechanical metamaterial and an optical metasurface with large tunability. Our results highlight a promising route toward active metasurfaces, with potential applications in tunable filters, reconfigurable lenses, and dynamic wavefront shaping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonic integrated circuits offer significant improvements in processing bandwidth, power efficiency, and low latency, addressing the needs of future microwave communication systems. Several successful applications have been demonstrated in this field; however, the focus is now shifting toward integrating these applications into single programmable photonic circuits. This approach not only reduces fabrication costs but also makes photonics more accessible for everyday use. This paper presents a scalable silicon-based signal processor with advanced functionalities, including high-speed arbitrary waveform generation,tunable bandwidth filtering and ultrabroadband beamforming. These results highlight improvements in both scale and performance, representing a significant step forward in large-scale, high-performance, multifunctional photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Stable Soliton Microcomb Generation in X-cut Lithium Tantalate via Thermal-Assisted Photorefractive Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-based soliton frequency microcombs combine compact size, broad bandwidth, and high coherence, presenting a promising solution for integrated optical telecommunications, precision sensing, and spectroscopy. Recent progress in ferroelectric thin films, particularly thin-film Lithium niobate (LN) and thin-film Lithium tantalate (LT), has significantly advanced electro-optic (EO) modulation and soliton microcombs generation, leveraging their strong third-order nonlinearity and high Pockels coefficients. However, achieving soliton frequency combs in X-cut ferroelectric materials remains challenging due to the competing effects of thermo-optic and photorefractive phenomena. These issues hinder the simultaneous realization of soliton generation and high-speed EO modulation. Here, following the thermal-regulated carrier behaviour and auxiliary-laser-assisted approach, we propose a convenient mechanism to suppress both photorefractive and thermal dragging effect at once, and implement a facile method for soliton formation and its long-term stabilization in integrated X-cut LT microresonators for the first time. The resulting mode-locked states exhibit robust stability against perturbations, enabling new pathways for fully integrated photonic circuits that combine Kerr nonlinearity with high-speed EO functionality.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and dark modes in the motion of a pair of levitated nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate a system composed of two levitating nanospheres whose motions are indirectly coupled via coherent scattering in a single optical cavity mode. The nanospheres are loaded into a double longitudinal tweezer created with two lasers at different wavelengths, where chromatic aberration leads to the formation of two separate trapping sites. We achieve strong coupling between each pair of modes in the transverse plane of the tweezer, as demonstrated by the avoided crossings observed when tuning the eigenfrequencies of the motion of one nanosphere by varying its optical potential depth. Remarkably, we show the emergence of dark modes in the overall coupled motion. The dynamics can be described in terms of spin-1/2 matrices, and the observed features are ubiquitous in a variety of classical and quantum systems. As such, our experiment will allow us to explore the classical analog of typically quantum dynamics, and in further developments to investigate the transition to the quantum domain by lowering the decoherence rate and creating stationary entanglement, as well as implementing non-stationary protocols.</description>

      <title>Efficient passivation of III-As(P) photonic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface effects can significantly impact the performance of nanophotonic and quantum photonic devices, especially as the device dimensions are reduced. In this work, we propose and investigate a novel approach to surface passivation to mitigate these challenges in photonic nanostructures with III-As(P) quantum wells defined by a dry etching process. The nanostructures are annealed under the phosphine (PH$_3$) ambient inside a metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy chamber to eliminate surface and subsurface defects induced during the dry etching and subsequent oxidation of the etched sidewalls. Moreover, encapsulation of the active material with a wider bandgap material allows for maintaining the band structure of the device, mitigating band bending effects. Our findings reveal an almost order of magnitude reduction in the surface recombination velocity from $2 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the PH$_3$ annealing compared to $1.5 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the non-passivated structures and $5 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the standard method based on (NH$_4$)$_2$S wet treatment followed by Al$_2$O$_3$ encapsulation. A further reduction to $5 \times 10^2 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ is achieved for the InP-regrown samples. Additionally, we develop a model accounting for the impact of surface charges in the analysis of time-resolved photoluminescence curves and demonstrate that the proposed passivation method effectively reduces the surface charge density on the sidewalls of the studied quantum well-based photonic nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report intense terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons, representing a major step toward achieving stimulated cyclotron emission and polariton-based lasers. By strongly coupling the cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells with optical cavity modes, we observe efficient emission near the lasing threshold. This work demonstrates that polariton condensation, a process that bypasses the need for electronic population inversion, can significantly reduce the emission threshold compared to conventional mechanisms requiring high electric fields. Moreover, this concept unlocks the potential for stimulated emission in previously unsuitable narrow-gap semiconductors, as well as Dirac materials with non-equidistant Landau levels. These results open a new way for the development of compact, tunable terahertz lasers based on Landau polaritons, offering new opportunities for solid-state laser technology and applications in the terahertz gap.</description>

      <title>Towards the generation of petawatt near-infrared few-cycle light pulses via forward Raman amplification in plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light amplification towards extremely high power in the infrared regime remains a significant challenge due to the lack of suitable gain media. Here we propose a new scheme to amplify a laser pulse with tunable wavelengths towards extremely high power via forward Raman amplification in plasma. Different from those previously proposed schemes based upon backward Raman or Brillouin amplification, our scheme involves a pump pulse and a seed pulse co-propagating in moderate density plasma, with the phase matching conditions for forward Raman scattering fulfilled. Due to their group velocity difference in plasma, the pump with a shorter wavelength and longer duration will chase the seed and transfer energy to the latter efficiently. Analytical models both for linear and nonlinear stages of amplification as well as particle-in-cell simulation show that by employing a 1.0 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ pump laser, a 1.8 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ seed pulse can be amplified $10^4$ times in its intensity, and then self-compressed to near-single-cycle. Our scheme shows the merits of high efficiency, high compactness, and relatively easy implementation with the co-propagating configuration, which may provide a unique route towards the petawatt few-cycle infrared laser pulses.</description>

Abstract: Bringing increasingly complex polyatomic molecules within reach of precision measurement experiments offers fascinating and far-reaching prospects ranging from Earth sciences and astrophysics, to metrology and quantum sciences. Here, we demonstrate sub-Doppler spectroscopic measurements in the mid-IR fingerprint region of, to our knowledge, the largest molecule to date. To this end, we use a high-resolution ~10.3 $\mu$m spectrometer based on a sub-Hz quantum cascade laser remotely calibrated against state-of-the-art primary frequency standards via a metrology-grade fibre link. We perform saturated absorption spectroscopy in the v5 CO stretching mode of 1,3,5-trioxane, (H2CO)3, at a resolution of ~100 kHz, allowing us to measure the absolute frequency of hundreds of rovibrational transitions at unprecedented uncertainties for such a complex species, as low as ~5 kHz. Our work demonstrates the extension of frequency metrology methodologies to ever larger molecular system, confirming the potential of the technologies we develop for bringing increasingly complex species within reach of ultra-precise measurement experiments.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Fourier-domain Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography for a fast tomographic quantum imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using spectrally correlated photon pairs instead of classical laser light and coincidence detection instead of light intensity detection, Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography (Q-OCT) outperforms classical OCT in several experimental terms. It provides twice better axial resolution with the same spectral bandwidth and it is immune to even-order chromatic dispersion, including Group Velocity Dispersion responsible for the bulk of axial resolution degradation in the OCT images. Q-OCT has been performed in the time domain configuration, where one line of the two-dimensional image is acquired by axially translating the mirror in the interferometer's reference arm and measuring the coincidence rate of photons arriving at two single-photon-sensitive detectors. Although successful at producing resolution-doubled and dispersion-cancelled images, it is still relatively slow and cannot compete with its classical counterpart. Here, we experimentally demonstrate Q-OCT in a novel Fourier-domain configuration, theoretically proposed in 2020, where the reference mirror is fixed and the joint spectra are acquired. We show that such a configuration allows for faster image acquisition than its time-domain configuration, providing a step forward towards a practical and competitive solution in the OCT arena. The limitations of the novel approach are discussed, contrasted with the limitations of both the time-domain approach and the traditional OCT.</description>

      <title>Broken symmetries associated with a Kagome chiral charge order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality or handedness manifests in all fields of science, ranging from cell biology, molecular interaction, and catalysis to different branches of physics. In condensed matter physics, chirality is intrinsic to enigmatic quantum phases, such as chiral charge density waves and chiral superconductivity. Here, the underlying chiral response is subtle and leads to broken symmetries in the ground state. Detection of subtle broken symmetries is the key to understand these quantum states but they are extremely challenging to expose leading to debate and controversy. Here, using second-order optical response, we uncover the broken symmetries of a chiral charge density wave in the Kagome lattice KV3Sb5, revealing the relevant broken symmetries of its charge order. KV3Sb5 undergoes a phase transition to a charge-ordered state at low temperatures. Our polarization-dependent mid-infrared photocurrent microscopy reveals an intrinsic, longitudinal helicity-dependent photocurrent associated with the charge order. Our measurements, supported by our theoretical analysis, provide direct evidence for broken inversion and mirror symmetries at the charge order transition, indicating a chiral charge ordered state. On the other hand, we do not observe a circular photogalvanic effect along the direction perpendicular to that of the incident light, imposing stringent constraints on the rotational and point group symmetries of the charge order. Our study not only visualizes the chiral nature of the Kagome charge order revealing its broken symmetries, but also highlights the nonlinear photogalvanic effect as a sensitive probe for detecting subtle symmetry breakings.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared group-IV nanowire laser</title>

Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires have shown great potential for enabling ultra-compact lasers for integrated photonics platforms. Despite the impressive progress in developing nanowire lasers, their integration into Si photonics platforms remains challenging largely due to the use of III-V and II-VI semiconductors as gain media. These materials not only have high material costs, but also require inherently complex integration with Si-based fabrication processing, increasing overall costs and thereby limiting their large-scale adoption. Furthermore, these material-based nanowire lasers rarely emit above 2 um, which is a technologically important wavelength regime for various applications in imaging and quantum sensing. Recently, group-IV nanowires, particularly direct bandgap GeSn nanowires capable of emitting above 2 um, have emerged as promising cost-effective gain media for Si-compatible nanowire lasers, but there has been no successful demonstration of lasing from this seemingly promising nanowire platform. Herein, we report the experimental observation of lasing above 2 um from a single bottom-up grown GeSn nanowire. By harnessing strain engineering and optimized cavity designs simultaneously, the single GeSn nanowire achieves an amplified material gain that can sufficiently overcome minimized optical losses, resulting in a single-mode lasing with an ultra-low threshold of ~5.3 kW cm-2. Our finding paves the way for all-group IV mid-infrared photonic-integrated circuits with compact Si-compatible lasers for on-chip classical and quantum sensing and free-space communication.</description>

Abstract: Silicon carbide is a promising material platform for hosting various color centers suitable for quantum information processing. Here, we report the design and demonstration of an integrated electro-optic modulator that can directly interface the silicon vacancy centers in the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator platform. Despite a relatively low electro-optic coefficient ($0.22$ pm/V), the optimized silicon carbide modulator is able to work in the 920 nm range with a propagation loss of less than $0.5$ dB/cm, featuring a 3-dB bandwidth around 500 MHz, an extinction ratio of 8-12 dB for an operating peak-to-peak voltage of 10 V, and a footprint of less than $0.1\ \text{mm}^2$. With such modulation performance, our work provides a cost-effective solution for the chip-scale implementation of the electro-optic modulation technology for interfacing color centers in the silicon carbide platform.</description>

      <title>Experimental generation of optimally chiral azimuthally-radially polarized beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a paraxial azimuthally-radially polarized beam (ARPB), a novel class of structured light beams that can be optimal chiral (OC), leading to maximum chirality density at a given energy density. By using vectorial light shaping techniques, we successfully generated a paraxial ARPB with precise control over its features, validating theoretical predictions. Our findings demonstrate the ability to finely adjust the chirality density of the ARPB across its entire range by manipulating a single beam parameter. Although our experimental investigations are primarily focused on the transverse plane, we show that fields whose transverse components satisfy the optimal chirality condition are optimally chiral in all directions, and our results highlight the promising potential of OC structured light for applications in the sensing and manipulation of chiral particles. We show that optical chirality is more general than the concept of handedness. This work represents a significant advancement toward practical optical enantioseparation and enantiomer detection at the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: Whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microcavities have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional ultrasound probes, offering high sensitivity and wide bandwidth. In our research, we propose a novel silica WGM microprobe device, with impressive Q factors up to 10^7.The side-coupled approach and special encapsulation design make the device small, robust, and capable of utilizing in both gaseous and liquid environments.We have successfully conducted photoacoustic (PA) imaging on various samples using this device which demonstrates a high sensitivity of 5.4 mPa/sqrt(Hz) and a board bandwidth of 41 MHz at -6 dB for ultrasound. What's more, it's capable of capturing the vibration spectrum of microparticles up to a few hundred megahertz. Our compact and lightweight device exhibits significant application potential in PA endoscopic detection, near-field ultrasound sensing and other aspects.</description>

      <title>Characterization of point-source transient events with a rolling-shutter compressed sensing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point-source transient events (PSTEs) - optical events that are both extremely fast and extremely small - pose several challenges to an imaging system. Due to their speed, accurately characterizing such events often requires detectors with very high frame rates. Due to their size, accurately detecting such events requires maintaining coverage over an extended field-of-view, often through the use of imaging focal plane arrays (FPA) with a global shutter readout. Traditional imaging systems that meet these requirements are costly in terms of price, size, weight, power consumption, and data bandwidth, and there is a need for cheaper solutions with adequate temporal and spatial coverage. To address these issues, we develop a novel compressed sensing algorithm adapted to the rolling shutter readout of an imaging system. This approach enables reconstruction of a PSTE signature at the sampling rate of the rolling shutter, offering a 1-2 order of magnitude temporal speedup and a proportional reduction in data bandwidth. We present empirical results demonstrating accurate recovery of PSTEs using measurements that are spatially undersampled by a factor of 25, and our simulations show that, relative to other compressed sensing algorithms, our algorithm is both faster and yields higher quality reconstructions. We also present theoretical results characterizing our algorithm and corroborating simulations. The potential impact of our work includes the development of much faster, cheaper sensor solutions for PSTE detection and characterization.</description>

      <title>Partial-immunity of two-photon correlation against wavefront distortion for spatially entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement in photons offers notable technological advancements over traditional qubit-based systems, including increased information density and enhanced security. However, such high-dimensional states are vulnerable to disruption by complex disordered media, presenting significant challenges in practical applications. Spatially-entangled photons are conventionally generated using a nonlinear crystal via spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). While the effect of disorder on spatially entangled photons in the near field of the crystal is well understood, the impact of disorder in the far field is more complex. In this work, we present a systematic study of the randomization of two-photon correlations caused by arbitrary phase distortions in the far field by breaking it down into odd and even parity components. First, we theoretically show that the two-photon field is only sensitive to the even-parity part of the phase distortion. In follow-up experiments, we employ a deformable mirror to implement random phase distortions, separating the contributions of odd and even parity phases using Zernike polynomials. The experimental results are in agreements with the theoretical predictions. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to show that these results extend to stronger degrees of disorder. Our key finding is that, since two-photon correlations are only affected by the even-parity component of phase modulations, the number of independent adaptive optics elements required for optimizing the correlation can be effectively halved, offering a significant practical advantage in managing disorder in quantum systems.</description>
