      <title>Retro-Rank-In: A Ranking-Based Approach for Inorganic Materials Synthesis Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis strategically plans the synthesis of a chemical target compound from simpler, readily available precursor compounds. This process is critical for synthesizing novel inorganic materials, yet traditional methods in inorganic chemistry continue to rely on trial-and-error experimentation. Emerging machine-learning approaches struggle to generalize to entirely new reactions due to their reliance on known precursors, as they frame retrosynthesis as a multi-label classification task. To address these limitations, we propose Retro-Rank-In, a novel framework that reformulates the retrosynthesis problem by embedding target and precursor materials into a shared latent space and learning a pairwise ranker on a bipartite graph of inorganic compounds. We evaluate Retro-Rank-In's generalizability on challenging retrosynthesis dataset splits designed to mitigate data duplicates and overlaps. For instance, for Cr2AlB2, it correctly predicts the verified precursor pair CrB + Al despite never seeing them in training, a capability absent in prior work. Extensive experiments show that Retro-Rank-In sets a new state-of-the-art, particularly in out-of-distribution generalization and candidate set ranking, offering a powerful tool for accelerating inorganic material synthesis.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Perturbations for Improved Training of Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done \textit{ad hoc} by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We demonstrate that this is the case when training a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and use this approach to identify an optimal perturbation and frequency. Our work allows optimization of training protocols of machine learning models using a statistical mechanical approach.</description>

      <title>Exact sampling of molecules in chemical space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of molecular similarity appears in many machine-learning algorithms based on the assumption that molecules with similar representations will also share similar properties. In this work, we propose a new way to study similarity measures in molecular graph space using a Monte Carlo approach. We enable direct sampling from the underlying distribution of chemical space without numerical approximations or complete enumeration of molecular graphs, the latter intractable for practically relevant graph sets of interest. The Monte Carlo method allows observation of several interesting fundamental properties of chemical space, such as a linear trend of average property derivatives in chemical space with respect to the property's value at the molecule of interest. The trend was observed for extensive and intensive properties, suggesting that this trend is an inherent property of chemical space.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Liquid State Modeling from Experimental Scattering Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This dissertation is founded on the central notion that structural correlations in dense fluids, such as dense gases, liquids, and glasses, are directly related to fundamental interatomic forces. This relationship was identified early in the development of statistical theories of fluids through the mathematical formulations of Gibbs in the 1910s. However, it took nearly 80 years before practical implementations of structure-based theories became widely used for interpreting and understanding the atomic structures of fluids from experimental X-ray and neutron scattering data. The breakthrough in successfully applying structure-potential relations is largely attributed to the advancements in molecular mechanics simulations and the enhancement of computational resources. Despite advancements in understanding the relationship between structure and interatomic forces, a significant gap remains. Current techniques for interpreting experimental scattering measurements are widely used, yet there is little evidence that they yield physically accurate predictions for interatomic forces. In fact, it is generally assumed that these methods produce interatomic forces that poorly model the atomistic and thermodynamic behavior of fluids, rendering them unreliable and non-transferable. This thesis aims to address these limitations by refining the statistical theory, computational methods, and philosophical approach to structure-based analyses, thereby developing more robust and accurate techniques for characterizing structure-potential relationships.</description>

      <title>Modeling Reactions on the Solid-Liquid Interface With Next Generation Extended Lagrangian Quantum-Based Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate how extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer quantum-based molecular dynamics (XL-BOMD) can be used to simulate heterogeneous electrocatalytic reactions. In particular, we apply our framework to study the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism on nitrogen-doped graphene in an aqueous solution. The electronic ground state and total energy of XL-BOMD are stabilized through nuclear and electronic equations of motion assisted by an integral kernel updated with low-rank approximations. A species charge analysis reveals that the XL-BOMD simulations can be used to detect electron transfer between the catalyst surface and the solvated molecular oxygen mediated by water molecules, resulting in the molecular dissociation of O$_2$. Simulations of the ORR under high electrochemical biases contribute to a larger body of work elucidating an outer-sphere ORR mechanism in which reduction occurs through water networks without direct adsorption of molecular oxygen.</description>

      <title>The coupled-cluster self-energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled-cluster and Green's function theories are highly successful in treating many-body electron correlation and there has been significant interest in identifying and leveraging connections between them. Here we present a diagrammatic definition of the irreducible coupled-cluster self-energy that directly embeds coupled-cluster theory within the framework of many-body field theory. The EOM-CC treatment emerges naturally from our definition via the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, providing a unified description of RPA, $GW$-BSE and CC theory for ground state and excitation energies. This clarifies the origin of previously established connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory, and exposes the relationship between vertex corrections and the coupled-cluster amplitude equations.</description>

      <title>MOL-Mamba: Enhancing Molecular Representation with Structural &amp; Electronic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in various downstream tasks, such as molecular property prediction and drug design. To accurately represent molecules, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown potential in the realm of self-supervised pretraining. However, existing approaches often overlook the relationship between molecular structure and electronic information, as well as the internal semantic reasoning within molecules. This omission of fundamental chemical knowledge in graph semantics leads to incomplete molecular representations, missing the integration of structural and electronic data. To address these issues, we introduce MOL-Mamba, a framework that enhances molecular representation by combining structural and electronic insights. MOL-Mamba consists of an Atom &amp; Fragment Mamba-Graph (MG) for hierarchical structural reasoning and a Mamba-Transformer (MT) fuser for integrating molecular structure and electronic correlation learning. Additionally, we propose a Structural Distribution Collaborative Training and E-semantic Fusion Training framework to further enhance molecular representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOL-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across eleven chemical-biological molecular datasets.</description>
