      <title>Spectral parameter power series representation for regular solutions of the radial Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spectral parameter power series (SPPS) representation for the regular solution of the radial Dirac system with complex coefficients is obtained, as well as a SPPS representation for the (entire) characteristic function of the corresponding spectral problem on a finite interval. Based on the SPPS representation, a numerical method for solving spectral problems is developed. It is shown that the method is also applicable to solving spectral problems for perturbed Bessel equations. We exhibit that the proposed numerical method delivers excellent results. Additionally, an application of the method to find the energy values of hydrogen-like atoms with a finite radius is presented.</description>

      <title>Singular Integrals associated with Reflection Groups on Euclidean Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of harmonic analysis, geometric considerations are frequently crucial. Specially, group actions such as translations, dilations and rotations on Euclidean space are instrumental. The objective of this paper is to extend the study of singular integrals to include the effects of group reflections on Euclidean space, and to establish the T1 theorem for these singular integrals.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and periodic orbits for the $n$-body problem: about the computational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main problem is to understand and to find periodic symmetric orbits in the $n$-body problem, in the sense of finding methods to prove or compute their existence, and more importantly to describe their qualitative and quantitative properties. In order to do so, and in order to classify such orbits and their symmetries, computers have been extensively used in many ways since decades. We will focus on some very special symmetric orbits, which occur as symmetric critical points (local minimizers) of the gravitational Lagrangean action functional. The exploration of the loop space of the $n$-point configuration space, raised some computational and mathematical questions that couldd be interesting. The aim of the article is to explain how such questions and issues were % considered in the development of a software package that combined symbolic algebra, numerical and scientific libraries, human interaction and visualization.</description>

      <title>Optimal discrete Hardy-Rellich-Birman inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sufficient conditions on a parameter sequence to determine optimal weights in inequalities for an integer power $\ell$ of the discrete Laplacian on the half-line. By a concrete choice of the parameter sequence, we obtain explicit optimal discrete Rellich ($\ell=2$) and Birman ($\ell\geq3$) weights. For $\ell=1$, we rediscover the optimal Hardy weight of Keller-Pinchover-Pogorzelski. For $\ell=2$, we improve upon the best known Rellich weights due to Gerhat-Krej\v{c}i\v{r}\'{i}k-\v{S}tampach and Huang-Ye. For $\ell\geq3$, our main result proves a conjecture by Gerhat-Krej\v{c}i\v{r}\'{i}k-\v{S}tampach and improves the discrete analogue of the classical Birman weight due to Huang-Ye to the optimal.</description>

      <title>On the distance problem over finite p-adic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distance problem in the setting of finite p-adic rings. In odd dimensions, our results are essentially sharp. In even dimensions, we clarify the conjecture and provide examples to support it. Surprisingly, compared to the finite field case, in this setting, we are able to provide a large family of sets such that the distance conjecture holds. By developing new restriction type estimates associated to circles and orbits, with a group theoretic argument, we will prove the $4/3$-parallel result in the two dimensions. This answers a question raised by Alex Iosevich. In a more general scenario, the existence/distribution of geometric/graph configurations will be also considered in this paper. Our results present improvements and extensions of recent results due to Ben Lichtin (2019, 2023). In comparison with Lichtin's method, our approach is much simpler and flexible, which is also one of the novelties in this paper.</description>

Abstract: We show that the set of points \[ \Big(\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+1}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+2}\Big), \] obtained as $A$ ranges over infinite sets of positive integers, has a non-empty interior. This answers in the affirmative a question of Erd\H{o}s and Straus (posed in a 1980 problem book by Erd\H{o}s and Graham).</description>

      <title>Feedback-delay dependence of the stability of cluster periodic orbits in populations of degrade-and-fire oscillators with common activator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback delay has been identified as a key ingredient in the quorum sensing synchronization of synthetic gene oscillators. While this influence has been evidenced at the theoretical level in a simplified system of degrade-and-fire oscillators coupled via a common activator protein, full mathematical certifications remained to be provided. Here, we prove from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint that, for the very same model, the synchronized degrade-and-fire oscillations are 1/ unstable with respect to out-of-sync perturbations in absence of delay, and 2/ are otherwise asymptotically stable in presence of delay, no matter how small is its amplitude. To that goal, we proceed to an extensive study of the population dynamics in this system, which in particular identifies the mechanisms of, and related criteria for, the delay-dependent stability of periodic orbits with respect to out-of-sync perturbations. As an additional outcome, the analysis also reveals that, depending on the parameters, multiple stable partially synchronized periodic orbits can coexist with the fully synchronized one.</description>

      <title>Mordell-Tornheim zeta functions and functional equations for Herglotz-Zagier type functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mordell-Tornheim zeta function and the Herglotz-Zagier function $F(x)$ are two important functions in Mathematics. By generalizing a special case of the former, namely $\Theta(z, x)$, we show that the theories of these functions are inextricably woven. We obtain a three-term functional equation for $\Theta(z, x)$ as well as decompose it in terms of the Herglotz-Hurwitz function $\Phi(z, x)$. This decomposition can be conceived as a two-term functional equation for $\Phi(z, x)$. Through this result, we are not only able to get Zagier's identity relating $F(x)$ with $F(1/x)$ but also two-term functional equation for Ishibashi's generalization of $F(x)$, namely, $\Phi_k(x)$ which has been sought after for over twenty years. We further generalize $\Theta(z, x)$ by incorporating two Gauss sums, each associated to a Dirichlet character, and decompose it in terms of an interesting integral which involves the Fekete polynomial as well as the character polylogarithm. This result gives infinite families of functional equations of Herglotz-type integrals out of which only two, due to Kumar and Choie, were known so far. The first one among the two involves the integral $J(x)$ who special values have received a lot of attention, more recently, in the work of Muzzaffar and Williams, and in that of Radchenko and Zagier. Analytic continuation of our generalization of $\Theta(z, x)$ is also accomplished which allows us to obtain transformations between certain double series and Herglotz-type integrals or their explicit evaluations.</description>

      <title>Generalized co-polynomials of $R_{II}$ type and associated quadrature rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the co-recursion and co-dilation in the recurrence relation of certain sequences of orthogonal polynomials are not at the same level, the behaviour of the modified orthogonal polynomials is expected to have different properties compared to the situation of the same level of perturbation. This manuscript attempts to derive structural relations between the perturbed and original $R_{II}$ type orthogonal polynomials. The classical result is improved using a transfer matrix approach. It turns out that the $R_{II}$ fraction with perturbation is the rational spectral transformation of the unperturbed one. The derived notions are used to deduce some consequences for the polynomials orthogonal on the real line. A natural question that arises while dealing with perturbations at different levels, i.e., which perturbation, co-recursion or co-dilation, needs to be performed first, is answered.</description>

Abstract: We derive formulae for Gram matrices arising in the Nyman--Beurling reformulation of the Riemann hypothesis. The development naturally leads upon series of the form $S(x) = \sum_{n\ge 1} R(nx)$ and their reciprocity relations. We give integral representations of these series; and we present decompositions of the quadratic forms associated with the Gram matrices along with a discussion of the components' properties.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of Bedford-McMullen carpets with applications to Lipschitz equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermediate dimensions were recently introduced to provide a spectrum of dimensions interpolating between Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions for fractals where these differ. In particular, the self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets are a natural case for investigation, but until now only very rough bounds for their intermediate dimensions have been found. In this paper, we determine a precise formula for the intermediate dimensions $\dim_{\, \theta}\Lambda$ of any Bedford-McMullen carpet $\Lambda$ for the whole spectrum of $\theta \in [0,1]$, in terms of a certain large deviations rate function. The intermediate dimensions exist and are strictly increasing in $\theta$, and the function $\theta\mapsto \dim_{\, \theta}\Lambda$ exhibits interesting features not witnessed on any previous example, such as having countably many phase transitions, between which it is analytic and strictly concave.
  We make an unexpected connection to multifractal analysis by showing that two carpets with non-uniform vertical fibres have equal intermediate dimensions if and only if the Hausdorff multifractal spectra of the uniform Bernoulli measures on the two carpets are equal. Since intermediate dimensions are bi-Lipschitz invariant, this shows that the equality of these multifractal spectra is a necessary condition for two such carpets to be Lipschitz equivalent.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the number of multidimensional partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain estimates for the number $p_d(n)$ of $(d-1)$-dimensional integer partitions of a number $n$. It is known that the two-sided inequality $C_1(d)n^{1-1/d}&lt;\log p_d(n)&lt; C_2(d)n^{1-1/d}$ is always true and that $C_1(d)&gt;1$ whenever $\log n&gt; 3d$. However, establishing the $``$right$"$ dependence of $C_2$ on $d$ remained an open problem. We show that if $d$ is sufficiently small with respect to $n$, then $C_2$ does not depend on $d$, which means that $\log p_d(n)$ is up to an absolute constant equal to $n^{1-1/d}$. Besides, we provide estimates of $p_d(n)$ for different ranges of $d$ in terms of $n$, which give the asymptotics of $\log p_d(n)$ in each case.</description>
