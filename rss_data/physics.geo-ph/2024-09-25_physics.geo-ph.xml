      <title>A machine learning algorithm for predicting naturalized flow duration curves at human influenced sites and multiple catchment scales</title>

Abstract: Regional flow duration curves (FDCs) often reflect streamflow influenced by human activities. We propose a new machine learning algorithm to predict naturalized FDCs at human influenced sites and multiple catchment scales. Separate Meta models are developed to predict probable flow at discrete exceedance probabilities across catchments spanning multiple stream orders. Discrete exceedance flows reflect the stacking of k-fold cross-validated predictions from trained base ensemble machine learning models with and without hyperparameter tuning. The quality of individual base models reflects random stratified shuffling of spilt catchment records for training and testing. A Meta model is formed by retraining minimum variance base models that are bias corrected and used to predict final flows at selected percentiles that quantify uncertainty. Separate Meta models are developed and used to predict naturalised stochastic flows at other discrete exceedance probabilities along the duration curve. Efficacy of the new method is demonstrated for predicting naturalized stochastic FDCs at human influenced gauged catchments and ungauged stream reaches of unknown influences across Otago New Zealand. Important findings are twofold. First, independent observations of naturalised Median flows compare within few percent of the 50th percentile predictions from the FDC models. Second, the naturalised Meta models predict FDCs that outperform the calibrated SWAT model FDCs at gauge sites in the Taieri Freshwater Management Unit: Taieri at Tiroiti, Taieri at Sutton Creek, and Taieri River at Outram. Departures in the naturalised reference state are interpreted as flow regime changes across the duration curves. We believe these Meta models will be useful in predicting naturalised catchment FDCs across other New Zealand regions using physical catchment features available from the national data base.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{L}$-moments reveal the scales of momentum transport in dense canopy flows</title>

Abstract: The interaction between a dense forest canopy and atmosphere is a complex fluid-dynamical problem with a wide range of practical applications, spanning from the aspects of carbon sequestration to the spread of wildfires through a forest. To delineate the eddy processes specific to canopy flows, we develop an $\mathcal{L}$-moment based event framework and apply it on a suite of observational datasets encompassing both canopy and atmospheric surface layer flows. In this framework, the turbulent fluctuations are considered as a chronicle of positive and negative events having finite lengths or time scales, whose statistical distributions are quantified through the $\mathcal{L}$ moments. $\mathcal{L}$ moments are statistically more robust than the conventional moments and have earlier been used in hydrology applications, but here we show how this concept is useful even for canopy flows. The $\mathcal{L}$-moment framework is complemented with wavelet analysis, leading to a discovery of a mixed time scale controlling the momentum exchanges between the atmosphere and the canopy air space. The origin of this mixed-scale is intimately linked to an interaction between two different eddy processes that transport momentum in the gradient and counter-gradient directions, respectively. This finding gives rise to a conceptual model of canopy turbulence that resolves a long-standing issue in canopy flows: why the integral timescale of vertical velocity increases as the heights approach the forest floor? Moreover, this model explains the intermittent nature of the wind inside a canopy despite its average being nearly zero due to canopy drag.</description>
