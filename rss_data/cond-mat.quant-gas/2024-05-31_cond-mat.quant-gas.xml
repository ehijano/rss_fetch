      <title>Generic transverse stability of kink structures in atomic and optical nonlinear media with competing attractive and repulsive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence and stability of one-dimensional (1D) topological kink configurations immersed in higher-dimensional bosonic gases and nonlinear optical setups. Our analysis pertains, in particular, to the two- and three-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii models with quantum fluctuations describing droplet-bearing environments but also to the two-dimensional cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation containing higher-order corrections to the nonlinear refractive index. Contrary to the generic dark soliton transverse instability, the kink structures are generically robust under the interplay of low-amplitude attractive and high-amplitude repulsive interactions. A quasi-1D effective potential picture dictates the existence of these defects, while their stability is obtained through linearization analysis and direct dynamics in the presence of external fluctuations showcasing their unprecedented resilience. These generic (across different models) findings should be detectable in current cold atom and optics experiments. They also offer insights towards controlling topological excitations and their usage in topological quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Space-time first-order correlations of an open Bose-Hubbard model with incoherent pump and loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correlation properties in the steady state of driven-dissipative interacting bosonic systems in the quantum regime, as for example non-linear photonic cavities. Specifically, we consider the Bose-Hubbard model on a periodic chain and with spatially homogeneous one-body loss and pump within the Markovian approximation. The steady state corresponds to an infinite temperature state at finite chemical potential with diagonal spatial correlations. Nonetheless, we observe a nontrivial behaviour of the space-time two-point correlation function in the steady state, obtained by exact diagonalisation. In particular, we find that the decay width of the propagator is not only renormalised at increasing interactions, as it is the case of a single non-linear resonator, but also at increasing hopping strength. We then compute the full spectral function, finding that it contains both a dispersive free-particle like dispersion at low energy and a doublon branch at energy corresponding to the on-site interactions. We compare with the corresponding calculation for the ground state of a closed quantum system and show that the driven-dissipative nature - determining both the steady state and the dynamical evolution - changes the low-lying part of the spectrum, where noticeably, the dispersion is quadratic instead of linear at small wavevectors.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Rydberg-dressed extended Bose Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition of different length scales in quantum many-body systems leads to various novel phenomena, including the emergence of correlated dynamics or non-local order. To access and investigate such effects in an itinerant lattice-based quantum simulator, it has been proposed to introduce tunable extended-range interactions using off-resonant optical coupling to Rydberg states. However, experimental realizations of such "Rydberg dressing" have so far mostly concentrated on spin systems without motion. Here, we overcome a number of experimental challenges limiting previous work and realize an effective one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model (eBHM). Harnessing our quantum gas microscope, we probe the correlated out-of-equilibrium dynamics of extended-range repulsively-bound pairs at low filling, and kinetically-constrained "hard rods" at half filling. Near equilibrium, we observe density ordering when adiabatically turning on the extended-range interactions. Our results demonstrate the versatility of Rydberg dressing in engineering itinerant optical lattice-based quantum simulators and pave the way to realizing novel light-controlled extended-range interacting quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond spin-charge separation: Helical modes and topological quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional Fermi gases with spin-orbit and Rabi couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental observation of spin-charge separation in one-dimensional interacting Fermi gases, we investigate these systems in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and Rabi fields. We demonstrate that spin-charge-separated modes evolve into helical collective modes due to the special mixing of spin and charge induced by spin-orbit coupling and Rabi fields. We obtain the phase diagram of chemical potential versus Rabi fields for given spin-orbit coupling and interactions, and find several topological quantum phase transitions of the Lifshitz type. We show that the velocities of the collective modes are nonanalytic at the boundaries between different phases. Lastly, we analyze the charge-charge, spin-charge and spin-spin dynamical structure factors to show that the dispersions, spectral weights and helicities of the collective modes can be experimentally extracted in systems such as $^{6}{\rm Li}$, $^{40}{\rm K}$ and $^{173}{\rm Yb}$.</description>

      <title>Rearrangement of single atoms in a 2000-site optical tweezers array at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the trapping of single rubidium atoms in large arrays of optical tweezers comprising up to 2088 sites in a cryogenic environment at 6 K. Our approach relies on the use of microscope objectives that are in-vacuum but at room temperature, in combination with windowless thermal shields into which the objectives are protruding to ensure a cryogenic environment for the trapped atoms. To achieve enough optical power for efficient trapping, we combine two lasers at slightly different wavelengths. We discuss the performance and limitations of our design. Finally, we demonstrate atom-by-atom rearrangement of an 828-atom target array using moving optical tweezers controlled by a field-programmable gate array.</description>

      <title>Stability and dynamics of nonlinear excitations in a two-dimensional droplet-bearing environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unravel stationary states in the form of dark soliton stripes, bubbles, and kinks embedded in a two-dimensional droplet-bearing setting emulated by an extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. The existence of these configurations is corroborated through an effectively reduced potential picture demonstrating their concrete parametric regions of existence. The excitation spectra of such configurations are analyzed within the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes framework exposing the destabilization of dark soliton stripes and bubbles, while confirming the stability of droplets, and importantly unveiling spectral stability of the kink against transverse excitations. Additionally, a variational approach is constructed providing access to the transverse stability analysis of the dark soliton stripe for arbitrary chemical potentials and widths of the structure. This is subsequently compared with the stability analysis outcome demonstrating very good agreement at small wavenumbers. Dynamical destabilization of dark soliton stripes via the snake instability is showcased, while bubbles are found to feature both a splitting into a gray soliton pair and a transverse instability thereof. These results shed light on unexplored stability and instability properties of nonlinear excitations in environments featuring a competition of mean-field repulsion and beyond-mean-field attraction that can be probed by state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Beyond universality in repulsive SU(N) Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Itinerant ferromagnetism in dilute Fermi gases is predicted to emerge at values of the gas parameter where second-order perturbation theory is not accurate enough to properly describe the system. We have revisited perturbation theory for SU(N) fermions and derived its generalization up to third order both in terms of the gas parameter and the polarization. Our results agree satisfactorily with quantum Monte Carlo results for hard-sphere and soft-sphere potentials for $S = 1/2$. Although the nature of the phase transition depends on the interaction potential, we find that for a hard-sphere potential a phase transition is guaranteed to occur. While for $S= 1/2$ we observe a quasi-continuous transition, for spins $3/2$ and $5/2$, a first-order phase transition is found. For larger spins, a double transition (combination of continuous and discontinuous) occurs. The critical density reduces drastically when the spin increases, making the phase transition more accessible to experiments with ultracold dilute Fermi gases. Estimations for Fermi gases of Yb and Sr with spin $5/2$ and $9/2$, respectively, are reported.</description>

      <title>Measurements conspire nonlocally to restructure critical quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically how local measurements perfomed on critical quantum ground states affect long-distance correlations. These states are highly entangled and feature algebraic correlations between local observables. As a consequence, local measurements can have highly nonlocal effects. Our focus is on Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) ground states, a continuous family of critical states in one dimension whose structure is parameterized by a Luttinger parameter $K$. We show that arbitrarily weak local measurements, performed over extended regions of space, can conspire to drive transitions in long-distance correlations. Conditioning first on a particular measurement outcome we show that there is a transition in the character of the post-measurement quantum state for $K&lt;1$, and highlight a formal analogy with the effect of a static impurity on transport through a TLL. To investigate the full ensemble of measurement outcomes we consider averages of physical quantities which are necessarily nonlinear in the system density matrix. We show how their behavior can be understood within a replica field theory, and for the measurements that we consider we find that the symmetry of the theory under exchange of replicas is broken for $K&lt;1/2$. A well-known barrier to experimentally observing the collective effects of multiple measurements has been the need to post-select on random outcomes. Here we resolve this problem by introducing cross-correlations between experimental measurement results and classical simulations, which act as resource-efficient probes of the transition. The phenomena we discuss are, moreover, robust to local decoherence.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>
