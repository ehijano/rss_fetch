      <title>A zero-dead-time strontium lattice clock with a stability at $10^{-19}$ level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks play a crucial role in fundamental physics, relativistic geodesy, and the future redefinition of the SI second. Standard operation relies on cyclic interrogation sequences, which alternate between atomic interrogation and dead time used for state preparation and readout. This approach introduces the Dick effect, where laser frequency noise aliases onto the atomic transition frequency. Although reducing laser noise improves clock stability, the Dick effect remains a key limitation. In this work, we demonstrate a zero-dead-time optical clock based on two interleaved ensembles of cold $^{87}\text{Sr}$ atoms. Our system significantly suppresses this noise and achieves a fractional frequency instability at the $10^{-19}$ level between 10,000 and 20,000 seconds over repeated measurements, with a best value of $2.9 \times 10^{-19}$ at $\tau = 20,000$ seconds. The estimated long-term stability based on the combined data of these measurements reaches $2.5 \times 10^{-19}$ at one day. These results represent a more than ninefold improvement over a conventional single-ensemble clock, highlighting its potential for next-generation timekeeping applications.</description>

      <title>Chaotic scattering and heating in cold ion-atom collisions: two sides of the same coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a Paul-trapped ion in a low-density bath of atoms above 1 $\mu\textrm{K}$. We find that lower energy collisions with more massive atoms, especially at energies less than the initial micromotion heating, are more likely to form atom-ion complexes. These complexes evolve in a fractal structure for every scattering observable, showing non-hyperbolic chaotic dynamics. To explore the chaotic dynamics, we use a GPU-accelerated methodology allowing us to run over $3\times 10^{8}$ trajectories of a $^{174}$Yb$^+$ and different atoms. As a result, after analyzing the dynamics as a function of the atom species, collision energy, trap parameters, and ion-atom potential depth, we find a link between heating and the onset of chaos in the first atom-ion interaction that occurs when a low-density atomic bath is merged with a trapped ion.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).</description>

      <title>Attosecond Optical Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circularly polarized light offers opportunities to probe symmetry-dependent properties of matter such as chirality and spin. Circular dichroism measurements typically require further intrinsic or extrinsic breaking of symmetry by e.g. enantiomeric excess, orientation, magnetic fields or direction-sensitive detectors. Here we introduce circular-dichroic attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy by leveraging the angular momentum of two circular-polarized pulses, both pump and probe, in an isotropic medium, optically orienting the angular momentum of excited states on an attosecond timescale. We investigate a circular-dichroic measurement of the attosecond transient absorption of He Rydberg states. By limiting the allowed pathways via dipole selection rules for co- and counter-rotating circular polarized NIR and XUV pulses, different spectral reshapings of the XUV transient absorption due to the AC Stark effect are observed. Paired with time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation calculations, the results show the role of selection and propensity rules and open up new opportunities to study coupling pathways of excited states as well as spin-dependent dynamics in atoms and beyond via attosecond optical orientation.</description>

      <title>Simulation of STIRAP from the 1S to the 2S states of the Hydrogen/Antihydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving a high population of antihydrogen/hydrogen atoms in the 2S level is essential for spectroscopy measurements testing similarities between matter and antimatter. We propose and examine the efficiency of applying the STIRAP (Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage) process in achieving high population transfer from the 1S to the 2S levels. We utilized a circularly polarized Lyman alpha, Ly-$\alpha$, pulse to couple the 1S state to the 2P state and a microwave pulse to couple the 2P state and the 2S state. We calculate the efficiency of the STIRAP process for transferring the population between the stretched states $(1S_d, 2S_d)$ as a function of experimental parameters such as Rabi frequencies and pulse durations. We find that a Ly-$\alpha$ pulse with an energy of a few nanojoules could produce nearly perfect transfer at zero detunings for atoms on the laser beam axis. We extended the analysis to a thermal ensemble of atoms, where Doppler detuning affects the velocity distribution of the hydrogen atoms produced in the 2S level. We found that the width of such velocity distribution is controlled by the Rabi frequency. We show that the peak velocity of the hydrogen atoms in the 2S level after STIRAP can be controlled by the Ly-$\alpha$ pulse detuning. The efficiency of STIRAP in transferring population increases at low temperature (T$\sim$1~mK). Finally, we show that a background magnetic field improves the transfer rates between the other trappable states $(1S_c, 2S_c)$.</description>
