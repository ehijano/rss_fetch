      <title>Geometric Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture for integer Quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to show a geometric version of Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture for an integer Quantum Hall state. Given an effective reduced divisor on a compact connected Riemann surface, using the canonical holomorphic section of the associated canonical line bundle as well as certain initial data and local normalisation data, we construct a canonical non-zero element in the determinant line of the cohomology of the $p$-tensor power of the line bundle.
  When endowed with proper metric data, the square of the $ L^{2} $-norm of our canonical element is the partition function associated to an integer Quantum Hall state. We establish an asymptotic expansion for the logarithm of the partition function when $ p\to +\infty$. The constant term of this expansion includes the holomorphic analytic torsion and matches a geometric version of Zabrodin-Wiegmann's prediction.
  Our proof relies on Bismut-Lebeau's embedding formula for the Quillen metrics, Bismut-Vasserot and Finski's asymptotic expansion for the analytic torsion associated to the higher tensor product of a positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundle.</description>

      <title>On stability of exponentially subelliptic harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability problem of exponentially subelliptic harmonic maps from sub-Riemannian manifolds to Riemannian manifolds. We derive the rst and second variation formulas for exponentially subelliptic harmonic maps, and apply these formulas to prove that if the target manifold has nonpositive curvature, the exponentially subelliptic harmonic map is stable. Further, we obtain the instability of exponentially subelliptic harmonic maps when the target manifold is a sphere.</description>

      <title>On Finsler metric measure manifolds with integral weighted Ricci curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study deeply geometric and topological properties of Finsler metric measure manifolds with the integral weighted Ricci curvature bounds. We first establish Laplacian comparison theorem, Bishop-Gromov type volume comparison theorem and relative volume comparison theorem on such Finsler manifolds. Then we obtain a volume growth estimate and Gromov pre-compactness under the integral weighted Ricci curvature bounds. Furthermore, we prove the local Dirichlet isoperimetric constant estimate on Finsler metric measure manifolds with integral weighted Ricci curvature bounds. As applications of the Dirichlet isoperimetric constant estimates, we get first Dirichlet eigenvalue estimate and a gradient estimate for harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Curvature Deformations on Complete Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates conformal deformations of the scalar curvature and mean curvature on complete Riemannian manifolds with boundary. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of conformal deformations to complete metrics with positive scalar curvature and mean convex boundary. Building upon these results, we explore further deformation scenarios, including those that increase the mean curvature. Finally, we consider the case of deforming complete manifolds with negative scalar curvature on manifolds with noncompact boundary.</description>

      <title>Riemannian 3-spheres that are hard to sweep out by short curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of Riemannian 3-spheres that cannot be "swept out" by short closed curves. More precisely, for each $L &gt; 0$ we construct a Riemannian 3-sphere $M$ with diameter and volume less than 1, so that every 2-parameter family of closed curves in $M$ that satisfies certain topological conditions must contain a curve that is longer than $L$. This obstructs certain min-max approaches to bound the length of the shortest closed geodesic in Riemannian 3-spheres.
  We also find obstructions to min-max estimates of the lengths of orthogonal geodesic chords, which are geodesics in a manifold that meet a given submanifold orthogonally at their endpoints. Specifically, for each $L &gt; 0$, we construct Riemannian 3-spheres with diameter and volume less than 1 such that certain orthogonal geodesic chords that arise from min-max methods must have length greater than $L$.</description>

      <title>A note On the existence of solutions to Hitchin's self-duality equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1987, Hitchin introduced the self-duality equations on rank-2 complex vector bundles over compact Riemann surfaces with genus greater than one as a reduction of the Yang-Mills equation and established the existence of solutions to these equations starting from a Higgs stable bundle. In this paper, we fill in some technical details in Hitchin's original proof by the following three steps. First, we reduce the existence of a solution of class $L_1^2$ to minimizing the energy functional within a Higgs stable orbit of the $L_2^2$ complex gauge group action. Second, using this transformation, we obtain a solution of class $L_1^2$ in this orbit. These two steps primarily follow Hitchin's original approach. Finally, using the Coulomb gauge, we construct a smooth solution by applying an $L_2^2$ unitary gauge transformation to the $L_1^2$ solution constructed previously. This last step provides additional technical details to Hitchin's original proof.</description>

      <title>Formal manifolds: local structure of morphisms, and formal submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a paper in a series that studies smooth relative Lie algebra homologies and cohomologies based on the theory of formal manifolds and formal Lie groups. In three previous papers, we introduce the notion of formal manifolds and study their basic theory, focusing on function spaces and Poincare's lemma. In this paper, we further explore the foundational framework of formal manifolds, including the local structure of constant rank morphisms (such as inverse function theorem and constant rank theorems) as well as the theory of formal submanifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a classification of homogeneous Riemannian structures on (non locally symmetric) $3$-dimensional Lie groups equipped with left invariant Riemannian metrics. This work together with classifications due to previous works yields a complete classification of all the homogeneous Riemannian structures on homogeneous Riemannian $3$-spaces. Two applications of the classification to contact Riemannian geometry and CR geometry are also given.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and nonexistence of complete spacelike hypersurfaces in the steady state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study complete spacelike hypersurfaces immersed in an open region of the de Sitter space $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}_{1}$ which is known as the steady state space $\mathcal{H}^{n+1}$. In this setting, under suitable constraints on the behavior of the higher order mean curvatures of these hypersurfaces, we prove that they must be spacelike hyperplanes of $\mathcal{H}^{n+1}$. Nonexistence results concerning these spacelike hypersurfaces are also given. Our approach is based on a suitable extension of the Omori-Yau's generalized maximum principle due to Al\'{\i}as, Impera and Rigoli in [5].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the geometry of principal orbits in quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds $M$ of cohomogeneity one. We focus on the complete cohomogeneity one examples obtained from the non-compact quaternionic K\"ahler symmetric spaces associated with the simple Lie groups of type A by the one-loop deformation. We prove that for zero deformation parameter the principal orbits form a fibration by solvsolitons (nilsolitons if $4n=\dim M=4$). The underlying solvable group is non-unimodular if $n&gt;1$ and is the Heisenberg group if $n=1$. We show that under the deformation, the hypersurfaces remain solvmanifolds but cease to be Ricci solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a hyperbolic three-manifold $M$ containing a closed minimal surface with principal curvatures in $[-1,1]$ also contains nearby (non-minimal) surfaces with principal curvatures in $(-1,1)$. When $M$ is complete and homeomorphic to $S\times\mathbb{R}$, for $S$ a closed surface, this implies that $M$ is quasi-Fuchsian, answering a question left open from Uhlenbeck's 1983 seminal paper. Additionally, our result implies that there exist (many) quasi-Fuchsian manifolds that contain a closed surface with principal curvatures in $(-1,1)$, but no closed minimal surface with principal curvatures in $(-1,1)$, disproving a conjecture from the 2000s.</description>

      <title>Boundary Curvature Scalars on Conformally Compact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a sequence of conformally invariant scalar curvature quantities, defined along the conformal infinity of a conformally compact (CC) manifold, that measure the failure of a CC metric to have constant negative scalar curvature in the interior, i.e. its failure to solve the singular Yamabe problem. Indeed, these "CC boundary curvature scalars" compute canonical expansion coefficients for singular Yamabe metrics. Residues of their poles yield obstructions to smooth solutions to the singular Yamabe problem and thus, in particular, give an alternate derivation of generalized Willmore invariants. Moreover, in a given dimension, the critical CC boundary scalar characterizes the image of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the singular Yamabe problem. We give explicit formulae for the first five CC boundary curvature scalars required for a global study of four dimensional singular Yamabe metrics, as well as asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Domains with Nearly Maximal Yamabe Quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a smooth, bounded domain in $\mathbb R^3$ with connected boundary. It follows from work of Escobar that the Yamabe quotient of $\Omega$ is at most the Yamabe quotient of a ball, and equality holds if and only if $\Omega$ is a ball. We show that if equality almost holds then the following things are true:
  (i)$\Omega$ is diffeomorphic to a ball;
  (ii) There is a small number $\epsilon &gt; 0$ such that $B(x,r) \subset \Omega \subset B(x,r(1+\epsilon))$; (iii) After suitable scaling, $\Omega$ is Gromov-Hausdorff close to the unit ball when considered as a metric space with its induced length metric.
  We also give a qualitative comparison between $Q$ and the coefficient of quasi-conformality studied in the theory of quasi-conformal maps.</description>

Abstract: We provide an alternative construction of the quasi-Fuchsian flows introduced by Ghys in \cite{Ghys-92}. Our approach is based on the coupled vortex equations that allows to see these flows as thermostats on the unit tangent bundle of the Blaschke metric uniquely determined by a conformal class and a holomorphic quadratic differential. We also give formulas for the marked length spectrum of a quasi-Fuchsian flow.</description>

      <title>The Associated Discrete Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and Mean Curvature with Higher order Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $\mathbb{R}^3$, the primal and dual constructions yield completely different discrete Laplacians for tetrahedral meshes.In this article, we prove that the discrete Laplacian satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Dirichlet energy in terms of the associated discrete Laplacian corresponding to the dual construction. Specifically, for a three simplex immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the associated discrete Laplacian on the tetrahedron can be expressed as the discrete Laplacian of the faces of the tetrahedron and the associated discrete mean curvature term given by the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^3$. Based on geometric foundations, we provide a mathematical proof showing that the dual construction gives a optimal Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^3$ compared to the primal construction. Moreover, we show that the associated discrete mean curvature is more sensitive to the initial mesh than other state-of-the-art discrete mean curvatures when the angle changes instantaneously. Instead of improving the angular transient accuracy through mesh subdivision, we can improve the accuracy by providing a higher order approximation of the instantaneous change in angle to reduce the solution error.</description>

      <title>Families of diffeomorphisms, embeddings, and positive scalar curvature metrics via Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct infinite rank summands isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ in the higher homotopy and homology groups of the diffeomorphism groups of certain $4$-manifolds. These spherical families become trivial in the homotopy and homology groups of the homeomorphism group; an infinite rank subgroup becomes trivial after a single stabilization by connected sum with $S^2 \times S^2$. The stabilization result gives rise to an inductive construction, starting from non-isotopic but pseudoisotopic diffeomorphisms constructed by the second author in 1998. The spherical families give $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ summands in the homology of the classifying spaces of specific subgroups of those diffeomorphism groups.
  The non-triviality is shown by computations with family Seiberg-Witten invariants, including a gluing theorem adapted to our inductive construction. As applications, we we obtain infinite generation for higher homotopy and homology groups of spaces of embeddings of surfaces and $3$-manifolds in various $4$-manifolds, and for the space of positive scalar curvature metrics on standard PSC $4$-manifolds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.11335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an upper bound for the volume of the convex hull of a simple closed Frenet curve having exactly four vertices, i.e., four points of vanishing torsion, and lying on the boundary of its convex hull. Moreover, we show that the upper bound is attained when the curve intersects every plane in at most four points, a condition studied by Scherk and Segre in the 1930s. The proof hinges on the fact that, under the four-vertex assumption, the convex hull is a union of line segments, and so it admits an elementary parametrization. We also comment on a question posed by Newson in 1899.</description>

      <title>Quantitative marked length spectrum rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ of negative curvature and dimension at least 3 with marked length spectrum sufficiently close (multiplicatively) to that of a locally symmetric space $N$. Using the methods of Hamenst\"adt, we show the volumes of $M$ and $N$ are approximately equal. We then show the Besson-Courtois-Gallot map $F: M \to N$ is a diffeomorphism with derivative bounds close to 1 and depending on the ratio of the two marked length spectrum functions. Thus, we refine the results of Hamenst\"adt and Besson-Courtois-Gallot, which show $M$ and $N$ are isometric if their marked length spectra are equal. We also prove a similar result for compact negatively curved surfaces using the methods of Otal together with a version of the Gromov compactness theorem due to Pugh.</description>

      <title>A discrete analog of Segre's theorem on spherical curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a discrete analog of a certain four-vertex theorem for space curves. The smooth case goes back to the work of Beniamino Segre and states that a closed and smooth curve whose tangent indicatrix has no self-intersections admits at least four points at which its torsion vanishes. Our approach uses the notion of discrete tangent indicatrix of a (closed) polygon. Our theorem then states that a polygon with at least four vertices and whose discrete tangent indicatrix has no self-intersections admits at least four flattenings, i.e., triples of vertices such that the preceding and following vertices are on the same side of the plane spanned by this triple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The marked length spectrum (MLS) of a closed negatively curved manifold $(M, g)$ is known to determine the metric $g$ under various circumstances. We show that in these cases, (approximate) values of the MLS on a sufficiently large finite set approximately determine the metric. Our approach is to recover the hypotheses of our main theorems in arXiv:2203.12128, namely multiplicative closeness of the MLS functions on the entire set of closed geodesics of $M$. We use mainly dynamical tools and arguments, but take great care to show the constants involved depend only on concrete geometric information about the given Riemannian metrics, such as the dimension, sectional curvature bounds, and injectivity radii.</description>

Abstract: The critical points of the total scalar curvature functional, restricted to closed $n$-dimensional manifolds with constant scalar curvature metrics and unit volume, are termed CPE metrics. In 1987, Arthur L. Besse conjectured that CPE metrics are always Einstein. Using the theory of minimal surfaces, we prove the conjecture for three-dimensional manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We prove a canonical variation-type result for submersion metrics with positive intermediate Ricci curvatures. This can then be used in conjunction with surgery techniques to establish the existence of metrics with positive intermediate Ricci curvatures on a wide range of examples which had previously only been known to admit positive Ricci curvature, such as highly connected manifolds and exotic spheres. Further, we extend results of the second author on the moduli space of metrics with positive Ricci curvature to positive intermediate Ricci curvatures.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers and compatible almost complex structures on the Hard Lefschetz condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A special class of symplectic manifolds is those satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition. The algebraic property of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb C)$-module gives a natural constraint on the Betti numbers. However, such a constraint is only necessary, and it is not so clear what condition on the Betti numbers is equivalent to the Hard Lefschetz condition. In this paper, we give some relations between the Betti numbers and the variant Hodge numbers on the Hard Lefschetz condition. In general, we give a sufficient condition on Betti numbers and variant Hodge numbers for any almost K\"ahler manifold satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition. In particular, we offer an equivalent condition on the first Betti number for compact symplectic $4$-manifolds satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the heat flow provides good approximation properties for the area functional on proper $\RCD(K,\infty)$ spaces, implying that in this setting the area formula for functions of bounded variation holds and that the area functional coincides with its relaxation. We then obtain partial regularity and uniqueness results for functions whose hypographs are perimeter minimizing. Finally, we consider sequences of $\RCD(K,N)$ spaces and we show that, thanks to the previously obtained properties, Sobolev minimizers of the area functional in a limit space can be approximated with minimizers along the converging sequence of spaces. Using this last result, we obtain applications on Ricci-limit spaces.</description>

      <title>Topological Spherical T-duality -- Dimension change from higher degree $H$-flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological Spherical T-duality was introduced by Bouwknegt, Evslin and Mathai in [BEM15] as an extension of topological T-duality from $S^1$-bundles to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-bundles endowed with closed 7-forms. This notion was further extended to sphere bundles by Lind, Sati and Westerland [LSW16] as a duality between $S^{2n-1}$-bundles endowed with closed $(4n-1)$-forms. We generalise this relation one step further and define T-duality for $S^{2n-1}$-bundles endowed with closed odd forms of arbitrary degree. The degree of the form determines the dimension of the fibers of the dual spaces. We show that $T$-duals exist and, as in the previous cases, $T$-dual spaces have isomorphic twisted cohomology. We finish by introducing a version of Courant algebroids which is compatible with spherical T-duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new approach for constructing minimal submanifolds of codimension 1 in the round spheres is proposed. In the case of $\mathbb{S}^3$ two immersions of the Clifford torus and all Lawson $\tau_{n, m}$ surfaces are described in terms of $(\lambda, \mu)$-eigenfunctions. Also, a new proof of a theorem that describes $(\lambda, \mu)$-eigenfunctions on sphere is obtained. This proof is based on a statement that a function $f$ is a $(\lambda, \mu)$-eigenfunction if and only if $f$ and $f^2$ are eigenfunctions for the Laplace-Beltrami operator.</description>

The flow belongs to the family of Hermitian curvature flows introduced by Streets and Tian and it was considered by Lee in order to study compact Hermitian manifolds with almost negative Chern bisectional curvature. We show a regularity result on compact complex parallelizable manifolds and we prove that Chern-flat metrics are dynamically stable.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic mean curvature type flow and capillary Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an anisotropic volume-preserving mean curvature type flow for star-shaped anisotropic $\omega_0$-capillary hypersurfaces in the half-space is studied, and the long-time existence and smooth convergence to a capillary Wulff shape are obtained. If the initial hypersurface is strictly convex, the solution of this flow remains to be strictly convex for all $t&gt;0$ by adopting a new approach applicable to anisotropic capillary setting. In analogy with closed hypersurfaces, if the $\omega_0$-capillary Wulff shape is a $\theta$-capillary hypersurface with constant contact angle $\theta$, the quermassintegrals for anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces match the mixed volume of two $\theta$-capillary convex bodies. Thus, generalized quermassintegrals for anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces with general Wulff shapes (i.e., the $\omega_0$-capillary Wulff shape has a variable contact angle) can be defined, which satisfy certain monotonicity properties along the flow. As applications, we establish an anisotropic capillary isoperimetric inequality for star-shaped anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces and a family of new Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for strictly convex anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces. In particular, we provide a flow's method to derive the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for two $\theta$-capillary hypersurfaces, demonstrated in [30] (arXiv:2408.13655) from the view of point in convex geometry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove general criticality criteria for operators $\Delta + V$ on manifolds with more than one end, where $V$ bounds the Ricci curvature, and a related spectral splitting theorem extending Cheeger-Gromoll's one. Our results give new insight on Li-Wang's theory of manifolds with a weighted Poincar\'e inequality. We apply them to study stable and $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds with non-negative bi-Ricci or sectional curvature, in ambient dimension up to $5$ and $6$, respectively. In the special case where the ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^4$, we prove that a $1/3$-stable minimal hypersurface must either have one end or be a catenoid, and that proper, $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces with $\delta &gt; 1/3$ must be hyperplanes.</description>

Abstract: We develop regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals defined on Hessian spaces of functions on open, bounded subdomains of $\mathbb{R}^n$, under compactly supported variations. The critical point solves a fourth order nonlinear equation in double divergence form. We show that for smooth convex functionals, a $W^{2,\infty}$ critical point with bounded Hessian is smooth provided that its Hessian has a small bounded mean oscillation (BMO). We deduce that the interior singular set of a critical point has Hausdorff dimension at most $n-p_0$, for some $p_0 \in (2,3)$. We state some applications of our results to variational problems in Lagrangian geometry. Finally, we use the Hamiltonian stationary equation to demonstrate the importance of our assumption on the a priori regularity of the critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present article introduces a generalization of the (multisymplectic) Hamiltonian field theory for a Lagrangian density, allowing the formulation of this kind of field theories for variational problem of more general nature than those associated to a classical variational problem. It is achieved by realizing that the usual construction of the Hamiltonian equations can be performed without the use of the so called Hamiltonian section, whose existence is problematic when general variational problems are considered. The developed formalism is applied to obtain a novel multisymplectic Hamiltonian field theory for a first order formulation of gravity with basis in the full frame bundle. Also, aspects of a constraint algorithm in this generalized setting are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indoor radar perception has seen rising interest due to affordable costs driven by emerging automotive imaging radar developments and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliability under hazardous conditions (e.g., fire and smoke). However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.91+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/merlresearch/radar-detection-transformer.</description>

Abstract: Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian and of other differential operators have been intensively studied in the past decades. The aim of this paper is to introduce differential forms and the de Rham complex in the study of such inequalities. We show how differential forms lie hidden at the heart of the work of Rohleder on inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for the Laplacian on planar domains. Moreover, we extend the ideas of Rohleder to a new proof of Friedlander's inequality for any bounded Lipschitz domain.</description>

      <title>Smoothness up to the free boundary for the $p$-Laplacian evolution equation and the $\alpha$-Gauss curvature flow</title>

Abstract: The $p$-Laplacian evolution equation and the $\alpha$-Gauss curvature flow with a flat side are degenerate parabolic equations with evolving free boundaries. We give proofs of smooth short-time existence, up to the free boundaries, using a result of the authors on linear degenerate equations on a fixed domain.</description>

      <title>Slope Stable Sheaves and Hermitian-Einstein Metrics on Normal Varieties with Big Cohomology Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of $\alpha$-slope stability of sheaves where $\alpha$ is a big cohomology class. We also define the notion of a $T$-Hermitian-Einstein metric for sheaves in terms of a closed positive $(1,1)$-current $T$. The first main theorem establishes the invariance of these notions under bimeromorphic transformations that are compositions of proper bimeromorphic maps and bimeromorphic morphisms isomorphic in codimension 1. The second main theorem proves the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence with respect to the canonical divisor on a projective variety of general type. We also discuss the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for $\alpha$-slope sheaves where $\alpha$ is a big and nef class</description>
