      <title>Reconfigurable collective resonances induced by liquid crystals in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can show multi-resonant response with high Q-factors in the visible range due to multipole coupling. This work suggests that these collective resonances in all-dielectric metasurfaces can be modified if adjacent to an anisotropic liquid crystal medium, opening a new path toward the dynamic metasurface effects. Using numerical full-wave simulations and the multipole decomposition technique for reflection and transmission coefficients we study the influence of the surrounding anisotropic medium on the resonant response of metasurfaces composed of disk-shaped dielectric nanoparticles. First, we consider tuning and switching the resonances induced by the polarization of the incident beam in metasurfaces placed in a medium with different orientations of LC molecules. Secondly, we study the case when the tuning of resonances is carried out by applying an external voltage that changes the orientation of LC molecules and thereby changes the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of directly tuning the resonant response of dielectric metasurfaces in an anisotropic environment, which is important for the development of optical nanodevices with dynamic switching of functional modes in the visible range.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic homogenized composite mediums arising from truncated spheres, spheroids, and ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions were recently derived for depolarization dyadics for truncated spheres and truncated spheroids, and the formalism was extended to truncated ellipsoids. These results were exploited to develop an implementation of the Maxwell Garnett homogenization formalism for the relative permittivity parameters of homogenized composite mediums (HCMs) arising from an isotropic host medium impregnated with isotropic inclusions that are truncated spheres, spheroids, and ellipsoids. In so doing, the anisotropy of the HCM was related to the geometry of the inclusions: in general, the more the shape of the inclusions deviated from spherical, the greater was the degree of anisotropy exhibited by the HCM.</description>

      <title>Propagation effects in resonant high-harmonic generation and high-order frequency mixing in laser plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase matching of resonant high-harmonic generation (HHG) and high-order frequency mixing (HFM) in plasma. We solve numerically the propagation equations coupled with the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for the nonlinear polarisation. The macroscopic harmonic signal is enhanced in the vicinity of a multiphoton resonance with the transition between the ground and autoionising states of the generating ion. We show that narrow and strong resonances (as for gallium and indium ions) provide compensation of the plasma dispersion in a spectral region above the exact resonance improving the phase matching and leading to a high macroscopic signal. The compensation does not take place for a wider resonance (as for manganese ions), instead the phase matching is achieved in the HFM process. Comparing the XUV generated in manganese plasma and in neon gas, we show that the resonant HHG in plasma is an order of magnitude more effective than in the gas, moreover another order of magnitude can be gained from the propagation using HFM in plasma.</description>

      <title>Tunable broadband polarization retarders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a type of tunable polarization retarder, which is composed of sequences of half-wave and quarter-wave polarization retarders, allowing operation at broad spectral bandwidth. The constituent retarders are composed of stacked standard half-wave retarders and quarter-wave retarders rotated at designated angles relative to their fast-polarization axes. The proposed composite retarder can be tuned to an arbitrary value of the retardance by varying the middle retarder alone, while maintaining its broadband spectral bandwidth intact.</description>

      <title>Tunable quasi-discrete spectrum of spin waves excited by periodic laser patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concept for selective excitation of magnetostatic surface waves with quasi-discrete spectrum using spatially patterned femtosecond laser pulses inducing either ultrafast change of magnetic anisotropy or inverse Faraday effect. We micromagnetically simulate excitation of the waves with periodically patterned uni- or bipolar laser impact. Such excitation yields multiple wavepackets propagating with different group velocities, whose dispersion corresponds to the set of quasi-discrete points. In addition, we show that the frequency of the spectral peaks can be controlled by the polarity of the periodic impact and its spatial period. Presented consideration of multiple spatially periodic SW sources as a whole enables implementation of a comprehensive toolkit of spatio-temporal optical methods for tunable SW excitation and control of its parameters.</description>

      <title>Very-Large-Scale Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Dynamic Control of Terahertz and Millimetre Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlocking the potential of terahertz (THz) and millimetre (mm) waves for next generation communications and imaging applications requires reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with programmable elements that can manipulate the waves in real-time. Realization of this technology has been hindered by the lack of efficient THz electro-optical materials and THz semiconductor platform. Here, by merging graphene-based THz modulators and the thin-film transistor (TFT) technology, we demonstrate mega-scale spatial light modulator arrays with individually addressable subwavelength pixels. We demonstrate electronically programmable patterns of intensity and phase of THz light over a large area with unprecedent levels of uniformity and reproducibility. To highlight the potential of these devices, we demonstrate a single pixel mm-wave camera capable of imaging metallic objects. We anticipate that these results will provide realistic pathways to structure THz waves for applications in non-invasive THz imaging and next generation THz communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient energy harvesting, conversion, and recycling technologies are crucial for addressing the challenges faced by modern societies and the global economy. The potential of harnessing mid-infrared (mid-IR) thermal radiation as a pervasive and readily available energy source has so far no been fully exploited, particularly through bioinspiration. In this article, by reviewing existing photon-based strategies and the efficiency of natural systems in harnessing light and thermal radiation, I highlight the promising role of bioinspiration in enhancing energy capture, conversion, and recycling. Natural photonic structures found in various organisms, including insects, birds, and plants, exhibit sophisticated optical properties that can be leveraged for energy-efficient applications. These developments pave the way for future research and innovation in bioinspired energy solutions. Ultimately, they contribute to the pursuit of a sustainable and environmentally conscious future by harnessing the beauty of nature's designs to meet humankind's energy needs.</description>

      <title>Selective excitation of high-order modes in two-dimensional cavity resonator integrated grating filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selective spatial mode excitation of a bi-dimensional grating-coupled micro-cavity called a Cavity Resonator Integrated Grating Filter (CRIGF) is reported using an incident beam shaped to reproduce the theoretical emission profiles of the device in one- and subsequently two-dimensions.In both cases, the selective excitation of modes up to order 10 (per direction) is confirmed by responses exhibiting one (respectively two) spectrally narrow-band resonance(s) with a good extinction of the other modes, the latter being shown to depend on the parity and order(s) of the involved modes. These results paves the way towards the demonstration of multi-wavelength spatially-selective reflectors or fibre-to-waveguide couplers. Also, subject to an appropriate choice of the materials constituting the CRIGF, this work can be extended to obtain mode-selectable laser emission or nonlinear frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Terawatt-level three-stage pulse compression for all-attosecond pump-probe spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of terawatt (TW) near-single-cycle laser pulses is of high interest for applications including attosecond science. Here we demonstrate a three-stage post-compression scheme in a non-guided geometry using He as the nonlinear medium, resulting in the generation of multi-mJ pulses with a duration of 3.7 fs. Key features of this approach are its simplicity, robustness and high stability, making it ideally suited for highly demanding applications such as attosecond-pump attosecond-probe spectroscopy (APAPS). This is demonstrated by performing two-color APAPS in Ar and Ne, where both simultaneous and sequential two-photon absorption are observed. Our approach is scalable to multi-TW powers.</description>

      <title>Narrow linewidth exciton-polariton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution spectroscopic investigation of the energy and linewidth of an exciton-polariton laser in the single-mode regime, which derives its coherent emission from an optically pumped and confined exciton-polariton condensate. We report an ultra-narrow linewidth of 56~MHz or 0.24~$\mu$eV, corresponding to a coherence time of 5.7~ns. The narrow linewidth is consistently achieved by using an exciton-polariton condensate with a high photonic content confined in an optically induced trap. Contrary to previous studies, we show that the excitonic reservoir created by the pump and responsible for creating the trap does not strongly affect the emission linewidth as long as the condensate is trapped and the pump power is well above the condensation (lasing) threshold. Our results open up opportunities for manipulating the macroscopic quantum state of the system owing to its long coherence time.</description>

      <title>Perovskite topological exciton-polariton disclination laser at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically nontrivial systems can be protected by band topology in momentum space, as seen in topological insulators and semimetals, or real-space topology, such as in lattice deformations known as topological disclinations (TDs). TDs, with inherent chiral symmetry, can support localized states pinned spectrally to the middle of the topological gap, preventing hybridization with bulk bands, and making them promising for topological lasers. Here, we experimentally realize a C4v symmetric TD laser based on perovskite exciton-polariton lattices at room temperature. Protected by the chiral and point group symmetries of the lattice, the TD state emerges in the middle of the gap and at the core of the perovskite lattice. Under a non-resonant pulsed excitation, coherent polariton lasing occurs precisely at the TD state with a low threshold of 9.5 uJ/cm2, as confirmed by momentum space and real space spectra measurements. This study not only introduces a class of symmetry-protected topological lasers, but also expands the landscape for exploring exciton-polariton light-matter interactions with novel topological structures.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent multi-pulse threshold due to SWCNT/PDMS saturable absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The threshold pump power for modelocking decreased by 18% when the temperature was increased from 25 to 100 degrees C, where a SWCNT/PDMS coated tapered fiber was used as the saturable absorber in a fiber laser. Further, the pump power at which multi-pulse operation began decreased by 24%, and the pump power range over which fundamental modelocking could be maintained decreased by 59% over the same temperature range. This decrease in stability is attributed to the large thermo-optic coefficient of the PDMS polymer, which results in a 40% reduction of the overlap between the evanescent field and SWCNT coating of the taper fiber over a temperature range of 75 degrees C.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Product Space for Studying the Interaction of Bipartite States of Light with Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairs of entangled photons are important for applications in quantum nanophotonics, where their theoretical description must accommodate their bipartite character. Such character is shared at the other end of the intensity range by, for example, the two degenerate instances of the pump field involved in second-harmonic generation. Describing the interaction of nanophotonic structures with bipartite states of light is, regardless of their intensity, a challenge with important technological applications. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for studying the interaction of material structures with bipartite states of light. The basic element is the symmetrized tensor product space of two copies of an electromagnetic Hilbert space. One of the benefits inherited from the single Hilbert space is that consequences of material symmetries are readily deduced. We derive selection rules for second-order non-linear processes in objects with rotational and/or mirror symmetries. We numerically verify several selection rules by combining quantum-chemical calculations with a Maxwell solver to simulate second-harmonic generation in two different MoS$_2$ clusters. The computationally convenient scattering matrix method is also extended to the tensor product space when the response of the object to one part of the state is independent of the other. For such a case, we obtain the relation between the scattering matrix in the single Hilbert space and the scattering matrix for bipartite states. Such a separable case is relevant for the entanglement evolution of biphoton states interacting with nanostructures. We discuss some possibilities for accommodating the computations of non-linear effects in the framework, for example, through a non-separable scattering operator, where the response of the object to one part of the state depends on the other part.</description>

      <title>Enhanced second harmonic generation in high-$Q$ all-dielectric metasurfaces with backward coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we employ the quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC) resonance in all-dielectric metasurfaces for efficient nonlinear processes in consideration of backward coupling. We theoretically study the second-harmonic generation (SHG) from symmetry-broken AlGaAs metasurfaces and reveal the efficiency enhancement empowered by high-$Q$ quasi-BIC resonances. By introducing the correction term of nonlinear polarization at the fundamental wave field to the conventional undepleted approximation, we uncover the effect of backward coupling on the nonlinear conversation efficiency. The SHG efficiency as $3.94\times10^{-3}$ with the developed depleted approximation, shows a 9$\%$ decrease compared with $4.33\times10^{-3}$ in conventional undepleted approximation, under the incident intensity of 10 GW/cm$^{2}$. Our results are of significant importance for designing efficient nonlinear metasurfaces supporting high-$Q$ resonances.</description>

      <title>Correcting directional dark-field x-ray imaging artefacts using position-dependent image deblurring and attenuation removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a novel x-ray imaging modality has emerged that reveals unresolved sample microstructure via a "dark-field image", which provides complementary information to conventional "bright-field" images, such as attenuation and phase-contrast modalities. This x-ray dark-field signal is produced by unresolved microstructures scattering the x-ray beam resulting in localised image blur. Dark-field retrieval techniques extract this blur to reconstruct a dark-field image. Unfortunately, the presence of non-dark-field blur such as source-size blur or the detector point-spread-function can affect the dark-field retrieval as they also blur the experimental image. In addition, dark-field images can be degraded by the artefacts induced by large intensity gradients from attenuation and propagation-based phase contrast, particularly around sample edges. By measuring any non-dark-field blurring across the image plane and removing it from experimental images, as well as removing attenuation and propagation-based phase contrast, we show that a directional dark-field image can be retrieved with fewer artefacts and more consistent quantitative measures. We present the details of these corrections and provide "before and after" directional dark-field images of samples imaged at a synchrotron source. This paper utilises single-grid directional dark-field imaging, but these corrections have the potential to be broadly applied to other x-ray imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous measurement of extensional stress and flow birefringence field for uniaxially extending worm-like micellar solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study proposes a novel and simple rheo-optical technique to investigate the relation between the rheology of complex fluids and their internal structural deformation under uniaxial extensional flow. The macroscale results of viscoelasticity from rheological measurements and microscale results of birefringence from optical measurements are combined to evaluate the microstructural deformation and orientation state inside the fluids under extensional stress. The proposed technique combines a liquid dripping method with a high-speed polarization camera to measure the extensional stress and flow-induced birefringence field simultaneously. In the liquid dripping method, temporal evolution images of the liquid filament diameter for fluids dripping from a nozzle are measured to obtain the extensional stress loading on the liquid filament. These images are captured with a high-speed polarization camera connected to a micro polarization element alley, enabling high-speed imaging of the birefringent field. Worm-like micellar solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) with varying concentrations of CTAB and NaSal are employed as the measurement targets. Consequently, we successfully visualized temporally developing images of the birefringence field of uniaxially extending worm-like micellar solutions induced by the orientation of micelles toward the extensional direction. Furthermore, the proposed technique supports investigating the conditions for establishing the stress-optical rule, which is the linear relation between stress and birefringence for complex fluids. The stress-optical coefficient, a proportionality constant indicating the sensitivity of birefringence to stress, is analyzed from these measurements. The stress-optical coefficient under uniaxial extensional flow is confirmed to be comparable to that under shear flow.</description>

      <title>Programmable Photonic Quantum Circuits with Ultrafast Time-bin Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum information processing platform that utilizes the ultrafast time-bin encoding of photons. This approach offers a pathway to scalability by leveraging the inherent phase stability of collinear temporal interferometric networks at the femtosecond-to-picosecond timescale. The proposed architecture encodes information in ultrafast temporal bins processed using optically induced nonlinearities and birefringent materials while keeping photons in a single spatial mode. We demonstrate the potential for scalable photonic quantum information processing through two independent experiments that showcase the platform's programmability and scalability, respectively. The scheme's programmability is demonstrated in the first experiment, where we successfully program 362 different unitary transformations in up to 8 dimensions in a temporal circuit. In the second experiment, we show the scalability of ultrafast time-bin encoding by building a passive optical network, with increasing circuit depth, of up to 36 optical modes. In each experiment, fidelities exceed 97\%, while the interferometric phase remains passively stable for several days.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we explore the quantum propagation of exciton polaritons in semiconductor microcavities, exhibiting intriguing effects such as interactions, decay, and disorder scatterings. Our investigation uncovers anomalies in their quantum propagation, deviating from predictions based on existing theories. By applying scaling theory, we elucidate the true nature of exciton polariton propagation, unveiling a localization phase that characteristically differs from Anderson localization. Our numerical results agree with the self-consistent theory developed for exciton polariton condensates, incorporating non-linearity and finite lifetime.</description>

      <title>Design of Tunable Perfect Absorbers in the Mid-IR Spectrum Using Graphene-Based Multilayer Structures: Emerging Applications in Atmospheric Window Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces tunable and switchable Perfect Absorbers (PAs) operating within the mid-infrared spectrum, specifically targeting the 3 to 5 um range at 0.25 um intervals. This spectrum is engineered for minimal atmospheric absorption and unique transmission characteristics. Our approach uses graphene-based nanophotonic aperiodic multilayer structures, optimized through micro-genetic algorithms within an inverse design framework. This combination broadens the design space, enabling highly accurate absorption control. Using the Transfer-Matrix-Method for simulations, we tailor absorption characteristics while keeping the structures under 2 um thick. Our results demonstrate PA tunability and switchability by adjusting graphene layers' chemical potentials. For instance, a 4 um peak can shift to 4.22 um by changing the graphene potential from 0 eV to 1 eV, without reducing efficiency. Our research also reveals PA adaptability to incident angles, maintaining 90% absorption up to 52 degrees, demonstrating versatility for applications like thermal photovoltaics, sensors, and stealth technology. This research deepens our understanding of nanophotonic materials and advances optical devices for the mid-IR range.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Blockade Optimizing via Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade in weak nonlinear regime is an exciting and promising subject that has been extensively studied in the steady state. However, how to achieve dynamic blockade in a single bosonic mode with weak nonlinearity using only pulsed driving field remains unexplored. Here, we propose to optimize the parameters of the pulsed driving field to achieve dynamic blockade in a single bosonic mode with weak nonlinearity via the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. We demonstrate that both Gaussian and rectangular pulses can be used to generate dynamic photon blockade in a single bosonic mode with weak nonlinearity. Based on the Fourier series expansions of the pulsed driving field, we identify that there are many paths for two-photon excitation in the bosonic mode, even only driven by pulsed field, and the dynamic blockade in weak nonlinear regime is induced by the destructive interference between them. Our work not only highlights the effectiveness of PSO algorithm in optimizing dynamical blockade, but also opens a way to optimize the parameters for other quantum effects, such as quantum entanglement and quantum squeezing.</description>

      <title>Quantifying broadband chromatic drifts in Fabry-Perot resonators for exoplanet science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of an Earth-Sun analog beyond our solar system is one of the most longstanding questions in science. At present, answering this question embodies an extremely difficult measurement problem that requires multiple coordinated advances in astronomical telescopes, fiber optics, precision spectrographs, large format detector arrays, and advanced data processing. Taken together, addressing this challenge will require the measurement and calibration of shifts in stellar spectra at the 10^-10 level over multi-year periods. The potential for such precision has recently been advanced by the introduction of laser frequency combs (LFCs) to the field of precision astronomical spectroscopy. However, the expense, complexity and lack of full spectral coverage of LFCs has limited their widespread use and ultimate impact. To address this issue, we explore simple and robust white-light-illuminated Fabry-Perot (FP) etalons as spectral calibrators for precise radial velocity measurements. We track the frequencies of up to 13,000 etalon modes of the installed FPs from two state-of-the-art astronomical spectrographs. Combining these measurements with modeling, we trace unexpected chromatic variations of the FP modes to sub-picometer changes in the dielectric layers of the broad bandwidth FP mirrors. This yields the determination of the frequencies of the FP modes with precision approaching 10^-11/day, equivalent to a radial velocity (RV) Doppler shift of 3 mm/s/day. These results represent critical progress in precision RV measurements on two fronts: first, they make FP etalons a more powerful stand-alone calibration tool, and second, they demonstrate the capability of LFCs to extend cm/s level RV measurement precision over periods approaching a year. Together, these advances highlight a path to achieving spectroscopic calibration at levels that will be critical for finding earths like our own.</description>

      <title>Fabry-Perot Resonance of Bilayer Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we constructed a Fabry-Perot cavity with nanostructured, thin resonant metasurfaces as meta-mirrors. We developed a temporal coupled-mode theory and provided an accurate generalization of Fabry-Perot resonance and analytically derived the transmission characteristics. The presence of metasurface mirrors introduces a substantial group delay, causing the field concentration to shift from the center of the Fabry-Perot cavity toward the metasurface region. This shift is accompanied by a significant increase in the quality factor of the FP resonance. In the frequency space, there are singular points where the quality factor increases exponentially. These singular points in meta-mirror cavities exist even when the cavity separations are smaller than the cavity length of the fundamental mode in the standard cavities. We discover two characteristic cavity separations, Lc and LQ, that differentiate the resonance in terms of lineshapes and the dominance of the quality factor. When L &lt; Lc, there is strong evanescent interaction between the two metasurface mirrors, and the coupling of this interaction with the traditional resonance produces sharp Fano-shaped transmission peaks. When Lc &lt; L&lt; LQ, we have induced transparency peaks with lorentzian line-shapes and length-independent quality factors. This length-independence enables, the meta-mirror cavity to outperform the traditional cavities by achiveing high quality factor despite a shorter cavity length.</description>

Abstract: Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) is a powerful non-invasive 3D imaging technique, but its combination with broadband light sources is difficult. In this study, we introduce ultrabroadband ODT, covering over 150 nm of visible spectral bandwidth with a lateral spatial resolution of 150 nm. Our work addresses a critical experimental gap by enabling the measurement of broadband refractive index changes in 3D samples, a crucial information that is difficult to assess with existing methodologies. We present broadband, spectrally resolved ODT images of HeLa cells, obtained via pulse-shaping based Fourier transform spectroscopy. The spectral observations enabled by ultrabroadband ODT, combined with material-dependent refractive index responses, allow for precise three-dimensional identification of the nanoparticles within cellular structures. Our work represents a crucial step towards time and spectrally-resolved tomography of complex 3D structures with implications for life and materials science applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental verification of field-enhanced molecular vibrational scattering at single infrared antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy exploits the field enhancement near nanophotonic structures for highly sensitive characterization of (bio)molecules. The vibrational signature observed in SEIRA spectra is typically interpreted as field-enhanced molecular absorption. Here we study molecular vibrations in the near field of single antennas and show that the vibrational signature can be equally well explained by field-enhanced molecular scattering. Although the infrared scattering cross section of molecules is negligible compared to their absorption cross section, the interference between the molecular-scattered field and the incident field enhances the spectral signature caused by molecular vibrational scattering by 10 orders of magnitude, thus becoming as large as that of field-enhanced molecular absorption. We provide experimental evidence that field-enhanced molecular scattering can be measured, scales in intensity with the fourth power of the local field enhancement and fully explains the vibrational signature in SEIRA spectra in both magnitude and line shape. Our work may open new paths for developing highly sensitive SEIRA sensors that exploit the presented scattering concept.</description>

      <title>Single-frame transmission and phase imaging using off-axis holography with undetected photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging with undetected photons relies upon nonlinear interferometry to extract the spatial image from an infrared probe beam and reveal it in the interference pattern of an easier-to-detect visible beam. Typically, the transmission and phase images are extracted using phase-shifting techniques and combining interferograms from multiple frames. Here we show that off-axis digital holography enables reconstruction of both transmission and phase images at the infrared wavelength from a single interferogram, and hence a single frame, recorded in the visible. This eliminates the need for phase stepping and multiple acquisitions, thereby greatly reducing total measurement time for imaging with long acquisition times at low flux or enabling video-rate imaging at higher flux. With this single-frame acquisition technique, we are able to reconstruct transmission images of an object in the infrared beam with a signal-to-noise ratio of $1.78\,\pm\,0.06$ at 10 frames per second, and record a dynamic scene in the infrared beam at 33 frames per second.</description>

      <title>The inverse Faraday effect at Mie resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, dielectric nanophotonics enables almost lossless resonant interaction between light and matter at the nanoscale. We show both theoretically and by electromagnetic simulations, that the peculiar nature of Mie-resonance induced effective magnetic fields contrasts sharply with the optomagnetism of smooth bulk materials. Mie resonances produce strongly nonuniform effective magnetic fields generated by the inverse Faraday effect. Different orders of optical resonances are characterized by different types of the effective magnetic field patterns. The number of point-like inverse Faraday effect sources can be controlled by adjusting the pump wavelength, allowing for the selective launch of spin waves with submicron wavelengths. A distinguish feature of the Mie-resonance-induced effective magnetic fields is the vortex structure that can be used for the magnetic skyrmion generation. The proposed approach considerably broadens the scope of nanoscale optomagnetism.</description>

Abstract: Artificial neural networks with internal dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises its physical openness, posing challenges for neuromorphic realizations. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with large-scale computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delayed inputs. Much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, we show that the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and large-scale Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, increased interpretability and fewer hyperparameters compared to conventional optical RC, while achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Given its scalability and versatility, our optical NGRC framework also paves the way for other next generation physical reservoirs, new applications and architectures in a broad sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In addition to a plethora of emergent phenomena, the spatial topology of optical vortices enables an array of applications spanning communications to quantum photonics. Nonlinear optics is essential in this context, providing access to an infinitely large set of quantum states associated with the orbital angular momentum of light. Nevertheless, the realization of such processes have failed to keep pace with the ever-growing need to shrink the fundamental length-scale of photonic technologies to the nanometer regime6. Here, we push the boundaries of vortex nonlinear optics to the ultimate limits of material dimensionality. By exploiting second and third-order frequency-mixing processes in semiconducting monolayers, we demonstrate the independent manipulation of the wavelength, orbital angular momentum, and spatial distribution of vortex light-fields. Due to the atomically-thin nature of the host quantum material, this control spans a broad spectral bandwidth in a highly-integrable platform, unconstrained by the traditional limits of bulk nonlinear optical materials. Our work heralds a new avenue for ultra-compact and scalable hybrid nanotechnologies empowered by twisted nonlinear light-matter interactions in van der Waals quantum nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Stable vortex solitons sustained by a localized gain in the cubic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple dissipative system with purely cubic defocusing nonlinearity and nonuniform linear gain that can support stable localized dissipative vortex solitons with high topological charges without the utilization of competing nonlinearities and nonlinear gain or losses. Localization of such solitons is achieved due to an intriguing mechanism when defocusing nonlinearity stimulates energy flow from the ring-like region with linear gain to the periphery of the medium where energy is absorbed due to linear background losses. Vortex solitons bifurcate from linear gain-guided vortical modes with eigenvalues depending on topological charges that become purely real only at specific gain amplitudes. Increasing gain amplitude leads to transverse expansion of vortex solitons, but simultaneously it usually also leads to stability enhancement. Increasing background losses allows creation of stable vortex solitons with high topological charges that are usually prone to instabilities in conservative and dissipative systems. Propagation of the perturbed unstable vortex solitons in this system reveals unusual dynamical regimes, when instead of decay or breakup, the initial state transforms into stable vortex soliton with lower or sometimes even with higher topological charge. Our results suggest an efficient mechanism for the formation of nonlinear excited vortex-carrying states with suppressed destructive azimuthal modulational instabilities in a simple setting relevant to a wide class of systems, including polaritonic systems, structured microcavities, and lasers.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional gradient force optical trapping in dielectric nanocavities by inverse design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical trapping enables precise control of individual particles of different sizes, such as atoms, molecules, or nanospheres. Optical tweezers provide free-space omnidirectional optical trapping of objects in laboratories around the world. As an alternative to standard macroscopic setups based on lenses, which are inherently bound by the diffraction limit, plasmonic and photonic nanostructures promise trapping by near-field optical effects on the extreme nanoscale. However, the practical design of lossless waveguide-coupled nanostructures capable of trapping deeply sub-wavelength particles in all spatial directions using the gradient force has until now proven insurmountable. In this work, we demonstrate an omnidirectional optical trap realized by inverse-designing fabrication-ready integrated dielectric nanocavities. The sub-wavelength optical trap is designed to rely solely on the gradient force and is thus particle-size agnostic. In particular, we show how a nanometer-sized trapped particle experiences a force strong enough to overcome room-temperature thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, through the robust inverse design framework, we tailor manufacturable devices operating at near-infrared and optical frequencies. Our results open a new regime of levitated optical trapping by achieving a deep trapping potential capable of trapping single sub-wavelength particles in all directions using optical gradient forces. We anticipate potentially groundbreaking applications of the optimized optical trapping system for biomolecular analysis in aqueous environments, levitated cavity-optomechanics, and cold atom physics, constituting an important step towards realizing integrated bio-nanophotonics and mesoscopic quantum mechanical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a simple, low-cost and ultracompact chiral resonant metasurface design, which, by strong local coupling to a quantum gain medium (quantum emitters), allows to implement an ultra-thin metasurface laser, capable of generating tunable circularly polarized coherent lasing output. According to our detailed numerical investigations the lasing emission can be transformed from linear to circular and switch from right- to left-handed circularly polarized (CP) not only by changing the metasurface chiral response but also by changing the polarization of a linearly polarized pump wave, providing thus dynamic lasing-polarization control. Given the increasing interest for CP laser emission, our chiral metasurface laser design proves to be a versatile yet straightforward strategy to generate strong and tailored CP emission laser, promising great potential for future applications in both photonics and materials science.</description>

Abstract: Photonic metasurfaces offer exceptional control over light at the nanoscale, facilitating applications spanning from biosensing, and nonlinear optics to photocatalysis. Many metasurfaces, especially resonant ones, rely on periodicity for the collective mode to form, which makes them subject to the influences of finite size effects, defects, and edge effects, all of which have considerable negative impact at the application level. These aspects are especially important for quasi-bound state in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces, for which the collective mode is highly sensitive to perturbations due to high quality factors and strong near-field enhancement. Here, we quantitatively investigate the mode formation in quasi-BIC metasurfaces on the individual resonator level using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) in combination with a new image processing technique. We find that the quasi-BIC mode is formed at a minimum size of 10 x 10-unit cells much smaller than expected from far-field measurements. Furthermore, we show that the coupling direction of the resonators, defects and edge states have pronounced influence on the quasi-BIC mode. This study serves as a link between the far-field and near-field responses of metasurfaces, offering crucial insights for optimizing spatial footprint and active area, holding promise for augmenting applications such as catalysis and biospectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Neural \'{E}tendue Expander for Ultra-Wide-Angle High-Fidelity Holographic Display</title>

Abstract: Holographic displays can generate light fields by dynamically modulating the wavefront of a coherent beam of light using a spatial light modulator, promising rich virtual and augmented reality applications. However, the limited spatial resolution of existing dynamic spatial light modulators imposes a tight bound on the diffraction angle. As a result, modern holographic displays possess low \'{e}tendue, which is the product of the display area and the maximum solid angle of diffracted light. The low \'{e}tendue forces a sacrifice of either the field-of-view (FOV) or the display size. In this work, we lift this limitation by presenting neural \'{e}tendue expanders. This new breed of optical elements, which is learned from a natural image dataset, enables higher diffraction angles for ultra-wide FOV while maintaining both a compact form factor and the fidelity of displayed contents to human viewers. With neural \'{e}tendue expanders, we experimentally achieve 64$\times$ \'{e}tendue expansion of natural images in full color, expanding the FOV by an order of magnitude horizontally and vertically, with high-fidelity reconstruction quality (measured in PSNR) over 29 dB on retinal-resolution images.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry emergence in a Hermitian system without symmetry</title>

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in systems with symmetry is a cornerstone phenomenon accompanying second-order phase transitions. Here, we predict the opposite phenomenon, namely, spontaneous symmetry emergence in a system without symmetry. On the example of two coupled oscillators interacting non-symmetrically with a set of oscillators whose frequencies uniformly fill a finite frequency range, we demonstrate that the system state can acquire symmetry, which is not inherent to the system Hamiltonian. The emergence of symmetry manifests itself in a change of the system dynamics, which can be interpreted as a phase transition in a Hermitian system without symmetry.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Wavelength-Multiplexed Reservoir Computing Using a Silicon Microring Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the promising advantages of photonic computing over conventional computing architectures is the potential to increase computing efficiency through massive parallelism by using the many degrees of freedom provided by photonics. Here, we numerically demonstrate the simultaneous use of time and frequency (equivalently wavelength) multiplexing to solve three independent tasks at the same time on the same photonic circuit. In particular, we consider a microring-based time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) scheme that simultaneously solves three tasks: Time-series prediction, classification, and wireless channel equalization. The scheme relies on time-division multiplexing to avoid the necessity of multiple physical nonlinear nodes, while the tasks are parallelized using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). The input data modulated on each optical channel is mapped to a higher dimensional space by the nonlinear dynamics of the silicon microring cavity. The carrier wavelength and input power assigned to each optical channel have a high influence on the performance of its respective task. When all tasks operate under the same wavelength/power conditions, our results show that the computing nature of each task is the deciding factor of the level of performance achievable. However, it is possible to achieve good performance for all tasks simultaneously by optimizing the parameters of each optical channel. The variety of applications covered by the tasks shows the versatility of the proposed photonic TDRC scheme. Overall, this work provides insight into the potential of WDM-based schemes for improving the computing capabilities of reservoir computing schemes.</description>

      <title>Single-exposure elemental differentiation and texture-sensitive phase-retrieval imaging with a neutron counting micro-channel plate detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors, when used at pulsed-neutron-source instruments, offer the possibility of high spatial resolution and high contrast imaging with pixel-level spectroscopic information. Here we demonstrate the possibility of multimodal analysis including total neutron cross-section spectra measurements, quantitative material differentiation imaging and texture-sensitive in-line phase imaging, from a single exposure using an MCP detector. This multimodal approach operates in full-field imaging mode, with the neutron transmission spectra acquired at each individual detector pixel. Due to the polychromatic nature of the beam and spectroscopic resolving capability of the detector, no energy scanning is required. Good agreement with the library reference data is demonstrated for neutron cross-section spectra measurements. Two different images corresponding to two selected energy bandwidths are used for elemental differentiation imaging. Moreover, the presence of changes in texture, i.e., preferred grain orientation, in the sample is identified from our phase-retrieval imaging results.</description>

      <title>Postselection technique for optical Quantum Key Distribution with improved de Finetti reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous action of a single photon at two remote places</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent single-photon detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of photons at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement by a single photon through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>
