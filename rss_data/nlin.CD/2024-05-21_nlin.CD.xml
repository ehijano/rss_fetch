      <title>Explosive synchronization in coupled stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of network topology on the collective dynamics of an oscillator ensemble. Specifically, we explore explosive synchronization in a system of interacting star networks. Explosive synchronization is characterized by an abrupt transition from an incoherent state to a coherent state. In this study, we couple multiple star networks through their hubs and study the emergent dynamics as a function of coupling strength. The dynamics of each node satisfies the equation of a Kuramoto oscillator. We observe that for a small inter-star coupling strength, the hysteresis width between the forward and backward transition point is minimal, which increases with an increase in the inter-star coupling strength. This observation is independent of the size of the network. Further, we find that the backward transition point is independent of the number of stars coupled together and the inter-star coupling strength, which is also verified using the Watanabe and Strogatz (WS) theory.</description>

      <title>Flow of unitary matrices: Real-space winding numbers in one and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of the flow introduced by Kitaev is a manifestly topological formulation of the winding number on a real lattice. First, we show in this paper that the flow is quite useful for practical numerical computations for systems without translational invariance. Second, we extend it to three dimensions. Namely, we derive a formula of the flow on a three-dimensional lattice, which corresponds to the conventional winding number when systems have translational invariance.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlators in electronic structure using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator spreading has profound implications in diverse fields ranging from statistical mechanics and blackhole physics to quantum information. The usual way to quantify it is through out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which are the quantum analog to Lyapunov exponents in classical chaotic dynamics. In this work we explore the phenomenon of operator spreading in quantum simulation of electronic structure in quantum computers. To substantiate our results, we focus on a hydrogen chain $H_4$ and demonstrate that operator spreading is enhanced when the chain is far from its equilibrium geometry. We also investigate the dynamics of bipartite entanglement and its dependence on the partition's size. Our findings reveal distinctive signatures closely resembling area- and volume-laws in equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium geometries, respectively. Our results provide insight of operator spreading of coherent errors in quantum simulation of electronic structure and can be experimentally implemented in various platforms available today.</description>

      <title>On the role of Loewner entropy in statistical mechanics of 2D Ising system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental properties of 2-dimensional (2D) Ising system were formulated using the Loewner theory. We focus on the role of the complexity measure of the 2D geometry, referred to as the Loewner entropy, to derive the statistical-mechanical relations of the 2D Ising system by analyzing the structure of the interface (i.e., the phase separation line). For the mixing property of the discrete Loewner evolution, we assume that the Loewner driving force ${\it\eta_s(n)}$ obtained from the interface has a stationary property, where the autocorrelation function $\langle{\it\eta_s(0)\eta_s(n)}\rangle $ converges in the long-time limit. Using this fact, we reconstruct the continuous Loewner evolution driven by the diffusion process whose increments correspond to the sequence of ${\it\eta_s(n)}$, and the fractal dimension of the generated curve was derived. We show that these formulations lead to a novel expression of the Hamiltonian, grand canonical ensemble of the system, which also are applicable for the non-equilibrium state of the system. In addition, the relations on the central limit theorem (CLT) governing the local fluctuation of the interface, the non-equilibrium free energy, and fluctuation dissipation relation (FDR) were derived using the Loewner theory. The present results suggest a possible form of the complexity-based theory of the 2D statistical mechanical systems that is applicable for the non-equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos and H\'enon-Heiles model: Dirac's variational approach with Jackiw-Kerman function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple semiclassical H\'enon-Heiles model is constructed based on Dirac's time-dependent variational principle. We obtain an effective semiclassical Hamiltonian using a Hatree-type two-body trial wavefunction in the Jackiw-Kerman form. Numerical results show that quantum effects can in fact induce chaos in the non-chaotic regions of the classical H\'enon-Heiles model.</description>
