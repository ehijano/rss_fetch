      <title>QUADS: QUAntized Distillation Framework for Efficient Speech Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems must balance performance and efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing methods apply distillation and quantization separately, leading to suboptimal compression as distillation ignores quantization constraints. We propose QUADS, a unified framework that optimizes both through multi-stage training with a pre-tuned model, enhancing adaptability to low-bit regimes while maintaining accuracy. QUADS achieves 71.13\% accuracy on SLURP and 99.20\% on FSC, with only minor degradations of up to 5.56\% compared to state-of-the-art models. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity by 60--73$\times$ (GMACs) and model size by 83--700$\times$, demonstrating strong robustness under extreme quantization. These results establish QUADS as a highly efficient solution for real-world, resource-constrained SLU applications.</description>

      <title>TCSinger 2: Customizable Multilingual Zero-shot Singing Voice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However, existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations, limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration, extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3) Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision, enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks.</description>

      <title>EASY: Emotion-aware Speaker Anonymization via Factorized Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion plays a significant role in speech interaction, conveyed through tone, pitch, and rhythm, enabling the expression of feelings and intentions beyond words to create a more personalized experience. However, most existing speaker anonymization systems employ parallel disentanglement methods, which only separate speech into linguistic content and speaker identity, often neglecting the preservation of the original emotional state. In this study, we introduce EASY, an emotion-aware speaker anonymization framework. EASY employs a novel sequential disentanglement process to disentangle speaker identity, linguistic content, and emotional representation, modeling each speech attribute in distinct subspaces through a factorized distillation approach. By independently constraining speaker identity and emotional representation, EASY minimizes information leakage, enhancing privacy protection while preserving original linguistic content and emotional state. Experimental results on the VoicePrivacy Challenge official datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all baseline systems, effectively protecting speaker privacy while maintaining linguistic content and emotional state.</description>

      <title>Towards Pre-training an Effective Respiratory Audio Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have sparked interest in respiratory audio foundation models. However, the effectiveness of applying conventional pre-training schemes to datasets that are small-sized and lack diversity has not been sufficiently verified. This study aims to explore better pre-training practices for respiratory sounds by comparing numerous pre-trained audio models. Our investigation reveals that models pre-trained on AudioSet, a general audio dataset, are more effective than the models specifically pre-trained on respiratory sounds. Moreover, combining AudioSet and respiratory sound datasets for further pre-training enhances performance, and preserving the frequency-wise information when aggregating features is vital. Along with more insights found in the experiments, we establish a new state-of-the-art for the OPERA benchmark, contributing to advancing respiratory audio foundation models. Our code is available online at https://github.com/nttcslab/eval-audio-repr/tree/main/plugin/OPERA.</description>

      <title>Analysis of ABC Frontend Audio Systems for the NIST-SRE24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the embedding extractors (frontends) developed by the ABC team for the audio track of NIST SRE 2024. We follow the two scenarios imposed by NIST: using only a provided set of telephone recordings for training (fixed) or adding publicly available data (open condition). Under these constraints, we develop the best possible speaker embedding extractors for the pre-dominant conversational telephone speech (CTS) domain. We explored architectures based on ResNet with different pooling mechanisms, recently introduced ReDimNet architecture, as well as a system based on the XLS-R model, which represents the family of large pre-trained self-supervised models. In open condition, we train on VoxBlink2 dataset, containing 110 thousand speakers across multiple languages. We observed a good performance and robustness of VoxBlink-trained models, and our experiments show practical recipes for developing state-of-the-art frontends for speaker recognition.</description>

      <title>On the Relevance of Clinical Assessment Tasks for the Automatic Detection of Parkinson's Disease Medication State from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic identification of medication states of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients can assist clinicians in monitoring and scheduling personalized treatments, as well as studying the effects of medication in alleviating the motor symptoms that characterize the disease. This paper explores speech as a non-invasive and accessible biomarker for identifying PD medication states, introducing a novel approach that addresses this task from a speaker-independent perspective. While traditional machine learning models achieve competitive results, self-supervised speech representations prove essential for optimal performance, significantly surpassing knowledge-based acoustic descriptors. Experiments across diverse speech assessment tasks highlight the relevance of prosody and continuous speech in distinguishing medication states, reaching an F1-score of 88.2%. These findings may streamline clinicians' work and reduce patient effort in voice recordings.</description>

      <title>Segmentation-Variant Codebooks for Preservation of Paralinguistic and Prosodic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization in SSL speech models (e.g., HuBERT) improves compression and performance in tasks like language modeling, resynthesis, and text-to-speech but often discards prosodic and paralinguistic information (e.g., emotion, prominence). While increasing codebook size mitigates some loss, it inefficiently raises bitrates. We propose Segmentation-Variant Codebooks (SVCs), which quantize speech at distinct linguistic units (frame, phone, word, utterance), factorizing it into multiple streams of segment-specific discrete features. Our results show that SVCs are significantly more effective at preserving prosodic and paralinguistic information across probing tasks. Additionally, we find that pooling before rather than after discretization better retains segment-level information. Resynthesis experiments further confirm improved style realization and slightly improved quality while preserving intelligibility.</description>

      <title>ToxicTone: A Mandarin Audio Dataset Annotated for Toxicity and Toxic Utterance Tonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on toxic speech detection in text, a critical gap remains in handling spoken Mandarin audio. The lack of annotated datasets that capture the unique prosodic cues and culturally specific expressions in Mandarin leaves spoken toxicity underexplored. To address this, we introduce ToxicTone -- the largest public dataset of its kind -- featuring detailed annotations that distinguish both forms of toxicity (e.g., profanity, bullying) and sources of toxicity (e.g., anger, sarcasm, dismissiveness). Our data, sourced from diverse real-world audio and organized into 13 topical categories, mirrors authentic communication scenarios. We also propose a multimodal detection framework that integrates acoustic, linguistic, and emotional features using state-of-the-art speech and emotion encoders. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms text-only and baseline models, underscoring the essential role of speech-specific cues in revealing hidden toxic expressions.</description>

      <title>GraphemeAug: A Systematic Approach to Synthesized Hard Negative Keyword Spotting Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken Keyword Spotting (KWS) is the task of distinguishing between the presence and absence of a keyword in audio. The accuracy of a KWS model hinges on its ability to correctly classify examples close to the keyword and non-keyword boundary. These boundary examples are often scarce in training data, limiting model performance. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically generate adversarial examples close to the decision boundary by making insertion/deletion/substitution edits on the keyword's graphemes. We evaluate this technique on held-out data for a popular keyword and show that the technique improves AUC on a dataset of synthetic hard negatives by 61% while maintaining quality on positives and ambient negative audio data.</description>

      <title>Replay Attacks Against Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how replay attacks undermine audio deepfake detection: By playing and re-recording deepfake audio through various speakers and microphones, we make spoofed samples appear authentic to the detection model. To study this phenomenon in more detail, we introduce ReplayDF, a dataset of recordings derived from M-AILABS and MLAAD, featuring 109 speaker-microphone combinations across six languages and four TTS models. It includes diverse acoustic conditions, some highly challenging for detection. Our analysis of six open-source detection models across five datasets reveals significant vulnerability, with the top-performing W2V2-AASIST model's Equal Error Rate (EER) surging from 4.7% to 18.2%. Even with adaptive Room Impulse Response (RIR) retraining, performance remains compromised with an 11.0% EER. We release ReplayDF for non-commercial research use.</description>

      <title>Towards Inclusive ASR: Investigating Voice Conversion for Dysarthric Speech Recognition in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech) to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model, Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE (Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning Boosts Speech Recognition via Human-like Adaptation to Speakers and Language Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human listeners readily adjust to unfamiliar speakers and language varieties through exposure, but do these adaptation benefits extend to state-of-the-art spoken language models? We introduce a scalable framework that allows for in-context learning (ICL) in Phi-4 Multimodal using interleaved task prompts and audio-text pairs, and find that as few as 12 example utterances (~50 seconds) at inference time reduce word error rates by a relative 19.7% (1.2 pp.) on average across diverse English corpora. These improvements are most pronounced in low-resource varieties, when the context and target speaker match, and when more examples are provided--though scaling our procedure yields diminishing marginal returns to context length. Overall, we find that our novel ICL adaptation scheme (1) reveals a similar performance profile to human listeners, and (2) demonstrates consistent improvements to automatic speech recognition (ASR) robustness across diverse speakers and language backgrounds. While adaptation succeeds broadly, significant gaps remain for certain varieties, revealing where current models still fall short of human flexibility. We release our prompts and code on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Discrete Audio Representations for Automated Audio Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete audio representations, termed audio tokens, are broadly categorized into semantic and acoustic tokens, typically generated through unsupervised tokenization of continuous audio representations. However, their applicability to automated audio captioning (AAC) remains underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the viability of audio token-driven models for AAC through comparative analyses of various tokenization methods. Our findings reveal that audio tokenization leads to performance degradation in AAC models compared to those that directly utilize continuous audio representations. To address this issue, we introduce a supervised audio tokenizer trained with an audio tagging objective. Unlike unsupervised tokenizers, which lack explicit semantic understanding, the proposed tokenizer effectively captures audio event information. Experiments conducted on the Clotho dataset demonstrate that the proposed audio tokens outperform conventional audio tokens in the AAC task.</description>

      <title>AsynFusion: Towards Asynchronous Latent Consistency Models for Decoupled Whole-Body Audio-Driven Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality, digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>SHEET: A Multi-purpose Open-source Speech Human Evaluation Estimation Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SHEET, a multi-purpose open-source toolkit designed to accelerate subjective speech quality assessment (SSQA) research. SHEET stands for the Speech Human Evaluation Estimation Toolkit, which focuses on data-driven deep neural network-based models trained to predict human-labeled quality scores of speech samples. SHEET provides comprehensive training and evaluation scripts, multi-dataset and multi-model support, as well as pre-trained models accessible via Torch Hub and HuggingFace Spaces. To demonstrate its capabilities, we re-evaluated SSL-MOS, a speech self-supervised learning (SSL)-based SSQA model widely used in recent scientific papers, on an extensive list of speech SSL models. Experiments were conducted on two representative SSQA datasets named BVCC and NISQA, and we identified the optimal speech SSL model, whose performance surpassed the original SSL-MOS implementation and was comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Audio Detection Using Fine-Tuned Audio Spectrogram Transformers: A Dataset-Driven Evaluation of Mixed AI-Human Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled sophisticated audio generation and voice cloning technologies, posing significant security risks for applications reliant on voice authentication. While existing datasets and models primarily focus on distinguishing between human and fully synthetic speech, real-world attacks often involve audio that combines both genuine and cloned segments. To address this gap, we construct a novel hybrid audio dataset incorporating human, AI-generated, cloned, and mixed audio samples. We further propose fine-tuned Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)-based models tailored for detecting these complex acoustic patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in mixed-audio detection, achieving 97\% classification accuracy. Our findings highlight the importance of hybrid datasets and tailored models in advancing the robustness of speech-based authentication systems.</description>

      <title>Voice-ENHANCE: Speech Restoration using a Diffusion-based Voice Conversion Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a speech enhancement system that combines speaker-agnostic speech restoration with voice conversion (VC) to obtain a studio-level quality speech signal. While voice conversion models are typically used to change speaker characteristics, they can also serve as a means of speech restoration when the target speaker is the same as the source speaker. However, since VC models are vulnerable to noisy conditions, we have included a generative speech restoration (GSR) model at the front end of our proposed system. The GSR model performs noise suppression and restores speech damage incurred during that process without knowledge about the target speaker. The VC stage then uses guidance from clean speaker embeddings to further restore the output speech. By employing this two-stage approach, we have achieved speech quality objective metric scores comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Unit Language Guidance to Advance Speech Modeling in Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of building textless speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models has attracted much attention. However, S2ST still faces two main challenges: 1) extracting linguistic features for various speech signals, called cross-modal (CM), and 2) learning alignment of difference languages in long sequences, called cross-lingual (CL). We propose the unit language to overcome the two modeling challenges. The unit language can be considered a text-like representation format, constructed using $n$-gram language modeling. We implement multi-task learning to utilize the unit language in guiding the speech modeling process. Our initial results reveal a conflict when applying source and target unit languages simultaneously. We propose task prompt modeling to mitigate this conflict. We conduct experiments on four languages of the Voxpupil dataset. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over a strong baseline and achieves performance comparable to models trained with text.</description>

      <title>Decoding Phone Pairs from MEG Signals Across Speech Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.</description>

      <title>MHANet: Multi-scale Hybrid Attention Network for Auditory Attention Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to detect the target speaker in a multi-talker environment from brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), which has made great progress. However, most AAD methods solely utilize attention mechanisms sequentially and overlook valuable multi-scale contextual information within EEG signals, limiting their ability to capture long-short range spatiotemporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-scale hybrid attention network (MHANet) for AAD, which consists of the multi-scale hybrid attention (MHA) module and the spatiotemporal convolution (STC) module. Specifically, MHA combines channel attention and multi-scale temporal and global attention mechanisms. This effectively extracts multi-scale temporal patterns within EEG signals and captures long-short range spatiotemporal dependencies simultaneously. To further improve the performance of AAD, STC utilizes temporal and spatial convolutions to aggregate expressive spatiotemporal representations. Experimental results show that the proposed MHANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer trainable parameters across three datasets, 3 times lower than that of the most advanced model.

      <title>Neurodyne: Neural Pitch Manipulation with Representation Learning and Cycle-Consistency GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pitch manipulation is the process of producers adjusting the pitch of an audio segment to a specific key and intonation, which is essential in music production. Neural-network-based pitch-manipulation systems have been popular in recent years due to their superior synthesis quality compared to classical DSP methods. However, their performance is still limited due to their inaccurate feature disentanglement using source-filter models and the lack of paired in- and out-of-tune training data. This work proposes Neurodyne to address these issues. Specifically, Neurodyne uses adversarial representation learning to learn a pitch-independent latent representation to avoid inaccurate disentanglement and cycle-consistency training to create paired training data implicitly. Experimental results on global-key and template-based pitch manipulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, marking improved synthesis quality while maintaining the original singer identity.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Autoregressive Speech Synthesis Inference With Speech Speculative Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern autoregressive speech synthesis models leveraging language models have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, the sequential nature of next token prediction in these models leads to significant latency, hindering their deployment in scenarios where inference speed is critical. In this work, we propose Speech Speculative Decoding (SSD), a novel framework for autoregressive speech synthesis acceleration. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight draft model to generate candidate token sequences, which are subsequently verified in parallel by the target model using the proposed SSD framework. Experimental results demonstrate that SSD achieves a significant speedup of 1.4x compared with conventional autoregressive decoding, while maintaining high fidelity and naturalness. Subjective evaluations further validate the effectiveness of SSD in preserving the perceptual quality of the target model while accelerating inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in discrete audio codecs have significantly improved speech representation modeling, while codec language models have enabled in-context learning for zero-shot speech synthesis. Inspired by this, we propose a voice conversion (VC) model within the VALLE-X framework, leveraging its strong in-context learning capabilities for speaker adaptation. To enhance prosody control, we introduce a prosody-aware audio codec encoder (PACE) module, which isolates and refines prosody from other sources, improving expressiveness and control. By integrating PACE into our VC model, we achieve greater flexibility in prosody manipulation while preserving speaker timbre. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline VC systems in prosody preservation, timbre consistency, and overall naturalness, surpassing baseline VC systems.</description>

      <title>Audio Jailbreak: An Open Comprehensive Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Audio Language Models (LAMs) brings both potential and risks, as their audio outputs may contain harmful or unethical content. However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of 1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories, converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency, and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio samples. Our findings demonstrate that even small, semantically preserved perturbations can significantly reduce the safety performance of leading LAMs, underscoring the need for more robust and semantically aware defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Moonbeam: A MIDI Foundation Model Using Both Absolute and Relative Music Attributes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moonbeam is a transformer-based foundation model for symbolic music, pretrained on a large and diverse collection of MIDI data totaling 81.6K hours of music and 18 billion tokens. Moonbeam incorporates music-domain inductive biases by capturing both absolute and relative musical attributes through the introduction of a novel domain-knowledge-inspired tokenization method and Multidimensional Relative Attention (MRA), which captures relative music information without additional trainable parameters. Leveraging the pretrained Moonbeam, we propose 2 finetuning architectures with full anticipatory capabilities, targeting 2 categories of downstream tasks: symbolic music understanding and conditional music generation (including music infilling). Our model outperforms other large-scale pretrained music models in most cases in terms of accuracy and F1 score across 3 downstream music classification tasks on 4 datasets. Moreover, our finetuned conditional music generation model outperforms a strong transformer baseline with a REMI-like tokenizer. We open-source the code, pretrained model, and generated samples on Github.</description>

      <title>Word Level Timestamp Generation for Automatic Speech Recognition and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach for enabling word-level timestamp prediction in the Canary model. Accurate timestamp information is crucial for a variety of downstream tasks such as speech content retrieval and timed subtitles. While traditional hybrid systems and end-to-end (E2E) models may employ external modules for timestamp prediction, our approach eliminates the need for separate alignment mechanisms. By leveraging the NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA) as a teacher model, we generate word-level timestamps and train the Canary model to predict timestamps directly. We introduce a new &lt;|timestamp|&gt; token, enabling the Canary model to predict start and end timestamps for each word. Our method demonstrates precision and recall rates between 80% and 90%, with timestamp prediction errors ranging from 20 to 120 ms across four languages, with minimal WER degradation. Additionally, we extend our system to automatic speech translation (AST) tasks, achieving timestamp prediction errors around 200 milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Direct Duplex Modeling for Speech-to-Speech Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.</description>

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the process of efficiently removing specific information from machine learning models, is a growing area of interest for responsible AI. However, few studies have explored the effectiveness of unlearning methods on complex tasks, particularly speech-related ones. This paper introduces UnSLU-BENCH, the first benchmark for machine unlearning in spoken language understanding (SLU), focusing on four datasets spanning four languages. We address the unlearning of data from specific speakers as a way to evaluate the quality of potential "right to be forgotten" requests. We assess eight unlearning techniques and propose a novel metric to simultaneously better capture their efficacy, utility, and efficiency. UnSLU-BENCH sets a foundation for unlearning in SLU and reveals significant differences in the effectiveness and computational feasibility of various techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring large-scale emotional speech data with strong consistency remains a challenge for speech synthesis. This paper presents MIKU-PAL, a fully automated multimodal pipeline for extracting high-consistency emotional speech from unlabeled video data. Leveraging face detection and tracking algorithms, we developed an automatic emotion analysis system using a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our results demonstrate that MIKU-PAL can achieve human-level accuracy (68.5% on MELD) and superior consistency (0.93 Fleiss kappa score) while being much cheaper and faster than human annotation. With the high-quality, flexible, and consistent annotation from MIKU-PAL, we can annotate fine-grained speech emotion categories of up to 26 types, validated by human annotators with 83% rationality ratings. Based on our proposed system, we further released a fine-grained emotional speech dataset MIKU-EmoBench(131.2 hours) as a new benchmark for emotional text-to-speech and visual voice cloning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although discrete speech tokens have exhibited strong potential for language model-based speech generation, their high bitrates and redundant timbre information restrict the development of such models. In this work, we propose LSCodec, a discrete speech codec that has both low bitrate and speaker decoupling ability. LSCodec adopts a multi-stage unsupervised training framework with a speaker perturbation technique. A continuous information bottleneck is first established, followed by vector quantization that produces a discrete speaker-decoupled space. A discrete token vocoder finally refines acoustic details from LSCodec. By reconstruction evaluations, LSCodec demonstrates superior intelligibility and audio quality with only a single codebook and smaller vocabulary size than baselines. Voice conversion and speaker probing experiments prove the excellent speaker disentanglement of LSCodec, and ablation study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed training framework.</description>

      <title>From KAN to GR-KAN: Advancing Speech Enhancement with KAN-Based Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement (SE) usually uses conventional activation functions, which lack the expressiveness to capture complex multiscale structures needed for high-fidelity SE. Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), retains KAN's expressiveness while improving scalability on complex tasks. We adapt GR-KAN to existing DNN-based SE by replacing dense layers with GR-KAN layers in the time-frequency (T-F) domain MP-SENet and adapting GR-KAN's activations into the 1D CNN layers in the time-domain Demucs. Results on Voicebank-DEMAND show that GR-KAN requires up to 4x fewer parameters while improving PESQ by up to 0.1. In contrast, KAN, facing scalability issues, outperforms MLP on a small-scale signal modeling task but fails to improve MP-SENet. We demonstrate the first successful use of KAN-based methods for consistent improvement in both time- and SoTA TF-domain SE, establishing GR-KAN as a promising alternative for SE.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Intelligibility for Generative Target Speech Extraction via Joint Optimization with Target Speaker ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target speech extraction (TSE) isolates the speech of a specific speaker from a multi-talker overlapped speech mixture. Most existing TSE models rely on discriminative methods, typically predicting a time-frequency spectrogram mask for the target speech. However, imperfections in these masks often result in over-/under-suppression of target/non-target speech, degrading perceptual quality. Generative methods, by contrast, re-synthesize target speech based on the mixture and target speaker cues, achieving superior perceptual quality. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook speech intelligibility, leading to alterations or loss of semantic content in the re-synthesized speech. Inspired by the Whisper model's success in target speaker ASR, we propose a generative TSE framework based on the pre-trained Whisper model to address the above issues. This framework integrates semantic modeling with flow-based acoustic modeling to achieve both high intelligibility and perceptual quality. Results from multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing generative and discriminative baselines. We present speech samples on https://aisaka0v0.github.io/GenerativeTSE_demo/.</description>

      <title>WhiSPA: Semantically and Psychologically Aligned Whisper with Self-Supervised Contrastive and Student-Teacher Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current speech encoding pipelines often rely on an additional text-based LM to get robust representations of human communication, even though SotA speech-to-text models often have a LM within. This work proposes an approach to improve the LM within an audio model such that the subsequent text-LM is unnecessary. We introduce WhiSPA (Whisper with Semantic and Psychological Alignment), which leverages a novel audio training objective: contrastive loss with a language model embedding as a teacher. Using over 500k speech segments from mental health audio interviews, we evaluate the utility of aligning Whisper's latent space with semantic representations from a text autoencoder (SBERT) and lexically derived embeddings of basic psychological dimensions: emotion and personality. Over self-supervised affective tasks and downstream psychological tasks, WhiSPA surpasses current speech encoders, achieving an average error reduction of 73.4% and 83.8%, respectively. WhiSPA demonstrates that it is not always necessary to run a subsequent text LM on speech-to-text output in order to get a rich psychological representation of human communication.</description>

      <title>MoHAVE: Mixture of Hierarchical Audio-Visual Experts for Robust Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) has become critical for enhancing speech recognition in noisy environments by integrating both auditory and visual modalities. However, existing AVSR systems struggle to scale up without compromising computational efficiency. In this study, we introduce MoHAVE (Mixture of Hierarchical Audio-Visual Experts), a novel robust AVSR framework designed to address these scalability constraints. By leveraging a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, MoHAVE activates modality-specific expert groups, ensuring dynamic adaptation to various audio-visual inputs with minimal computational overhead. Key contributions of MoHAVE include: (1) a sparse MoE framework that efficiently scales AVSR model capacity, (2) a hierarchical gating mechanism that dynamically utilizes the expert groups based on input context, enhancing adaptability and robustness, and (3) remarkable performance across robust AVSR benchmarks, including LRS3 and MuAViC transcription and translation tasks, setting a new standard for scalable speech recognition systems.</description>

      <title>MDDM: A Multi-view Discriminative Enhanced Diffusion-based Model for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of deep learning, speech enhancement has been greatly optimized in terms of speech quality. Previous methods typically focus on the discriminative supervised learning or generative modeling, which tends to introduce speech distortions or high computational cost. In this paper, we propose MDDM, a Multi-view Discriminative enhanced Diffusion-based Model. Specifically, we take the features of three domains (time, frequency and noise) as inputs of a discriminative prediction network, generating the preliminary spectrogram. Then, the discriminative output can be converted to clean speech by several inference sampling steps. Due to the intersection of the distributions between discriminative output and clean target, the smaller sampling steps can achieve the competitive performance compared to other diffusion-based methods. Experiments conducted on a public dataset and a realworld dataset validate the effectiveness of MDDM, either on subjective or objective metric.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Enhancing LLM-based AVSR: A Sparse Mixture of Projectors Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) enhances robustness in noisy environments by integrating visual cues. While recent advances integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into AVSR, their high computational cost hinders deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Llama-SMoP, an efficient Multimodal LLM that employs a Sparse Mixture of Projectors (SMoP) module to scale model capacity without increasing inference costs. By incorporating sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) projectors, Llama-SMoP enables the use of smaller LLMs while maintaining strong performance. We explore three SMoP configurations and show that Llama-SMoP DEDR (Disjoint-Experts, Disjoint-Routers), which uses modality-specific routers and experts, achieves superior performance on ASR, VSR, and AVSR tasks. Ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in expert activation, scalability, and noise robustness.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Subgroup Disparities in Multi-Label Speech Emotion Recognition: A Pseudo-Labeling and Unsupervised Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While subgroup disparities and performance bias are increasingly studied in computational research, fairness in categorical Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on explicit demographic labels, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we introduce an Implicit Demography Inference (IDI) module that leverages pseudo-labeling from a pre-trained model and unsupervised learning using k-means clustering to mitigate bias in SER. Our experiments show that pseudo-labeling IDI reduces subgroup disparities, improving fairness metrics by over 33% with less than a 3% decrease in SER accuracy. Also, the unsupervised IDI yields more than a 26% improvement in fairness metrics with a drop of less than 4% in SER performance. Further analyses reveal that the unsupervised IDI consistently mitigates race and age disparities, demonstrating its potential in scenarios where explicit demographic information is unavailable.</description>

Abstract: We introduce STAR (Stream Transduction with Anchor Representations), a novel Transformer-based model designed for efficient sequence-to-sequence transduction over streams. STAR dynamically segments input streams to create compressed anchor representations, achieving nearly lossless compression (12x) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and outperforming existing methods.

      <title>dMel: Speech Tokenization made Simple</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing by leveraging self-supervised pretraining on vast textual data. Inspired by this success, researchers have investigated various compression-based speech tokenization methods to discretize continuous speech signals, enabling the application of language modeling techniques to discrete tokens. However, audio compressor introduces additional complexity and computational cost, and often fail on out-of-domain audio signals. In this work, we introduce a novel speech representation (dmel) that discretizes mel-filterbank channels into intensity bins, creating a simpler yet more effective representation compared to existing speech tokenization methods. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in preserving audio content, robustness to out-of-domain data, and offers a training-free, natural, and streamable representation. To address the high-dimensional nature of log-mel spectrograms, we propose an efficient parallel encoding and decoding method for high-dimensional tokens using an LM-style transformer architecture. This innovation enables us to develop RichTTS and RichASR, two models sharing the same architecture while achieving comparable or better results than specialized existing methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of dmel in achieving high performance on both speech synthesis and recognition tasks within a unified framework, paving the way for efficient and effective joint modeling of speech and text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Unified Microphone Conversion, a unified generative framework designed to bolster sound event classification (SEC) systems against device variability. While our prior CycleGAN-based methods effectively simulate device characteristics, they require separate models for each device pair, limiting scalability. Our approach overcomes this constraint by conditioning the generator on frequency response data, enabling many-to-many device mappings through unpaired training. We integrate frequency-response information via Feature-wise Linear Modulation, further enhancing scalability. Additionally, incorporating synthetic frequency response differences improves the applicability of our framework for real-world application. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.6% and reduces variability by 0.8% in macro-average F1 score.</description>

      <title>Solid State Bus-Comp: A Large-Scale and Diverse Dataset for Dynamic Range Compressor Virtual Analog Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual Analog (VA) modeling aims to simulate the behavior of hardware circuits via algorithms to replicate their tone digitally. Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) is an audio processing module that controls the dynamics of a track by reducing and amplifying the volumes of loud and quiet sounds, which is essential in music production. In recent years, neural-network-based VA modeling has shown great potential in producing high-fidelity models. However, due to the lack of data quantity and diversity, their generalization ability in different parameter settings and input sounds is still limited. To tackle this problem, we present Solid State Bus-Comp, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for modeling the classical VCA compressor -- SSL 500 G-Bus. Specifically, we manually collected 175 unmastered songs from the Cambridge Multitrack Library. We recorded the compressed audio in 220 parameter combinations, resulting in an extensive 2528-hour dataset with diverse genres, instruments, tempos, and keys. Moreover, to facilitate the use of our proposed dataset, we conducted benchmark experiments in various open-sourced black-box and grey-box models, as well as white-box plugins. We also conducted ablation studies in different data subsets to illustrate the effectiveness of the improved data diversity and quantity. The dataset and demos are on our project page: https://www.yichenggu.com/SolidStateBusComp/.</description>

      <title>CAV-MAE Sync: Improving Contrastive Audio-Visual Mask Autoencoders via Fine-Grained Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-visual learning have shown promising results in learning representations across modalities. However, most approaches rely on global audio representations that fail to capture fine-grained temporal correspondences with visual frames. Additionally, existing methods often struggle with conflicting optimization objectives when trying to jointly learn reconstruction and cross-modal alignment. In this work, we propose CAV-MAE Sync as a simple yet effective extension of the original CAV-MAE framework for self-supervised audio-visual learning. We address three key challenges: First, we tackle the granularity mismatch between modalities by treating audio as a temporal sequence aligned with video frames, rather than using global representations. Second, we resolve conflicting optimization goals by separating contrastive and reconstruction objectives through dedicated global tokens. Third, we improve spatial localization by introducing learnable register tokens that reduce semantic load on patch tokens. We evaluate the proposed approach on AudioSet, VGG Sound, and the ADE20K Sound dataset on zero-shot retrieval, classification and localization tasks demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming more complex architectures.</description>

      <title>VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning.</description>

      <title>Hearing from Silence: Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos via Vision-Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans can intuitively infer sounds from silent videos, but whether multimodal large language models can perform modal-mismatch reasoning without accessing target modalities remains relatively unexplored. Current text-assisted-video-to-audio (VT2A) methods excel in video foley tasks but struggle to acquire audio descriptions during inference. We introduce the task of Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos (SVAD) to address this challenge and investigate vision-language models' (VLMs) capabilities on this task. To further enhance the VLMs' reasoning capacity for the SVAD task, we construct a CoT-AudioCaps dataset and propose a Chain-of-Thought-based supervised fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on SVAD and subsequent VT2A tasks demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two key aspects: significantly improving VLMs' modal-mismatch reasoning for SVAD and effectively addressing the challenge of acquiring audio descriptions during VT2A inference.</description>

Abstract: Multi-task and multilingual approaches benefit large models, yet speech processing for low-resource languages remains underexplored due to data scarcity. To address this, we present Granary, a large-scale collection of speech datasets for recognition and translation across 25 European languages. This is the first open-source effort at this scale for both transcription and translation. We enhance data quality using a pseudo-labeling pipeline with segmentation, two-pass inference, hallucination filtering, and punctuation restoration. We further generate translation pairs from pseudo-labeled transcriptions using EuroLLM, followed by a data filtration pipeline. Designed for efficiency, our pipeline processes vast amount of data within hours. We assess models trained on processed data by comparing their performance on previously curated datasets for both high- and low-resource languages. Our findings show that these models achieve similar performance using approx. 50% less data. Dataset will be made available at https://hf.co/datasets/nvidia/Granary</description>

      <title>Recreating Neural Activity During Speech Production with Language and Speech Model Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural activity encodes speech and language production is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. This study investigates whether embeddings from large-scale, self-supervised language and speech models can effectively reconstruct high-gamma neural activity characteristics, key indicators of cortical processing, recorded during speech production. We leverage pre-trained embeddings from deep learning models trained on linguistic and acoustic data to represent high-level speech features and map them onto these high-gamma signals. We analyze the extent to which these embeddings preserve the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. Reconstructed neural signals are evaluated against high-gamma ground-truth activity using correlation metrics and signal reconstruction quality assessments. The results indicate that high-gamma activity can be effectively reconstructed using large language and speech model embeddings in all study participants, generating Pearson's correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.99.</description>

      <title>AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they achieve suboptimal effectiveness, applicability, and practicability, particularly, assuming that the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts. In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available at our website https://audiojailbreak.github.io/AudioJailbreak.</description>

      <title>MatchDance: Collaborative Mamba-Transformer Architecture Matching for High-Quality 3D Dance Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music-to-dance generation represents a challenging yet pivotal task at the intersection of choreography, virtual reality, and creative content generation. Despite its significance, existing methods face substantial limitation in achieving choreographic consistency. To address the challenge, we propose MatchDance, a novel framework for music-to-dance generation that constructs a latent representation to enhance choreographic consistency. MatchDance employs a two-stage design: (1) a Kinematic-Dynamic-based Quantization Stage (KDQS), which encodes dance motions into a latent representation by Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) with kinematic-dynamic constraints and reconstructs them with high fidelity, and (2) a Hybrid Music-to-Dance Generation Stage(HMDGS), which uses a Mamba-Transformer hybrid architecture to map music into the latent representation, followed by the KDQS decoder to generate 3D dance motions. Additionally, a music-dance retrieval framework and comprehensive metrics are introduced for evaluation. Extensive experiments on the FineDance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>
