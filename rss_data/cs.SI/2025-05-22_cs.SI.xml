      <title>Ricci Matrix Comparison for Graph Alignment: A DMC Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph alignment problem explores the concept of node correspondence and its optimality. In this paper, we focus on purely geometric graph alignment methods, namely our newly proposed Ricci Matrix Comparison (RMC) and its original form, Degree Matrix Comparison (DMC). To formulate a Ricci-curvature-based graph alignment situation, we start with discussing different ideas of constructing one of the most typical and important topological objects, the torus, and then move on to introducing the RMC based on DMC with theoretical motivations. Lastly, we will present to the reader experimental results on a torus and a complex protein-protein interaction network that indicate the potential of applying a differential-geometric view to graph alignment. Results show that a direct variation of DMC using Ricci curvature can help with identifying holes in tori and aligning line graphs of a complex network at 80-90+% accuracy. This paper contributes a new perspective to the field of graph alignment and partially shows the validity of the previous DMC method.</description>

      <title>MPPFND: A Dataset and Analysis of Detecting Fake News with Multi-Platform Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fake news spreads widely on social media, leading to numerous negative effects. Most existing detection algorithms focus on analyzing news content and social context to detect fake news. However, these approaches typically detect fake news based on specific platforms, ignoring differences in propagation characteristics across platforms. In this paper, we introduce the MPPFND dataset, which captures propagation structures across multiple platforms. We also describe the commenting and propagation characteristics of different platforms to show that their social contexts have distinct features. We propose a multi-platform fake news detection model (APSL) that uses graph neural networks to extract social context features from various platforms. Experiments show that accounting for cross-platform propagation differences improves fake news detection performance.</description>

      <title>Web2Wiki: Characterizing Wikipedia Linking Across the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites globally, yet its role beyond its own platform remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of how Wikipedia is referenced across the Web. Using a dataset from Common Crawl, we identify over 90 million Wikipedia links spanning 1.68% of Web domains and examine their distribution, context, and function. Our analysis of English Wikipedia reveals three key findings: (1) Wikipedia is most frequently cited by news and science websites for informational purposes, while commercial websites reference it less often. (2) The majority of Wikipedia links appear within the main content rather than in boilerplate or user-generated sections, highlighting their role in structured knowledge presentation. (3) Most links (95%) serve as explanatory references rather than as evidence or attribution, reinforcing Wikipedia's function as a background knowledge provider. While this study focuses on English Wikipedia, our publicly released Web2Wiki dataset includes links from multiple language editions, supporting future research on Wikipedia's global influence on the Web.</description>

      <title>AH-UGC: Adaptive and Heterogeneous-Universal Graph Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textbf{Graph Coarsening (GC)}$ is a prominent graph reduction technique that compresses large graphs to enable efficient learning and inference. However, existing GC methods generate only one coarsened graph per run and must recompute from scratch for each new coarsening ratio, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Moreover, most prior approaches are tailored to $\textit{homogeneous}$ graphs and fail to accommodate the semantic constraints of $\textit{heterogeneous}$ graphs, which comprise multiple node and edge types. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that combines Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with Consistent Hashing to enable $\textit{adaptive graph coarsening}$. Leveraging hashing techniques, our method is inherently fast and scalable. For heterogeneous graphs, we propose a $\textit{type isolated coarsening}$ strategy that ensures semantic consistency by restricting merges to nodes of the same type. Our approach is the first unified framework to support both adaptive and heterogeneous coarsening. Extensive evaluations on 23 real-world datasets including homophilic, heterophilic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method achieves superior scalability while preserving the structural and semantic integrity of the original graph.</description>

      <title>Simulating Prosocial Behavior and Social Contagion in LLM Agents under Institutional Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as autonomous agents in social contexts, understanding their capacity for prosocial behavior becomes essential. We present ProSim, a simulation framework designed to examine how prosocial behavior emerges, adapts, and erodes in LLM-based agents under diverse social and institutional conditions. The framework comprises four components: individual simulation, scenario simulation, interaction simulation, and intervention simulation. We conduct three progressive studies to evaluate prosocial alignment. First, we show that LLM agents can demonstrate stable and context-sensitive prosocial behavior across diverse scenarios and adapt their responses under normative policy interventions. Second, we find that agents engage in fairness-based third-party punishment and respond systematically to variations in inequity magnitude and enforcement cost. Third, we show that policy-induced inequities suppress prosocial behavior, propagate through social networks, and are mediated by agents' perceptions of unfairness. These findings lay the groundwork for evaluating social alignment and modeling institutional dynamics in agent-driven societies.</description>

      <title>Tight Practical Bounds for Subgraph Densities in Ego-centric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgraph densities play a crucial role in network analysis, especially for the identification and interpretation of meaningful substructures in complex graphs. Localized subgraph densities, in particular, can provide valuable insights into graph structures. Distinguishing between mathematically-determined and domain-driven subgraph density features, however, poses challenges. For instance, the lack or presence of certain structures can be explained by graph density or degree distribution. These differences are especially meaningful in applied contexts as they allow us to identify instances where the data induces specific network structures, such as friendships in social networks. The goal of this paper is to measure these differences across various types of graphs, conducting social media analysis from a network perspective. To this end, we first provide tighter bounds on subgraph densities. We then introduce the subgraph spread ratio to quantify the realized subgraph densities of specific networks relative to the feasible bounds. Our novel approach combines techniques from flag algebras, motif-counting, and topological data analysis. Crucially, effective adoption of the state-of-the-art in the plain flag algebra method yields feasible regions up to three times tighter than prior best-known results, thereby enabling more accurate and direct comparisons across graphs. We additionally perform an empirical analysis of 11 real-world networks. We observe that social networks consistently have smaller subgraph spread ratios than other types of networks, such as linkage-mapping networks for Wikipedia pages. This aligns with our intuition about social relationships: such networks have meaningful structure that makes them distinct. The subgraph spread ratio enables the quantification of intuitive understandings of network structures and provides a metric for comparing types of networks.</description>

      <title>Novel Rewiring Mechanism for Restoration of the Fragmented Social Networks after Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world complex systems exhibit intricate interconnections and dependencies, especially social networks, technological infrastructures, and communication networks. These networks are prone to disconnection due to random failures or external attacks on their components. Therefore, managing the security and resilience of such networks is a prime concern, particularly at the time of disaster. Therefore, in this research work, network is reconstructed by rewiring/addition of the edges and robustness of the networks is measured. To this aim, two approaches namely (i) Strategic rewiring (ii) budget constrained optimal rewiring are adopted. While current research often assesses robustness by examining the size of the largest connected component, this approach fails to capture the complete spectrum of vulnerability. The failure of a small number of connections leads to a sparser network yet connected network. Thus, the present research work delves deeper into evaluating the robustness of the restored network by evaluating Laplacian Energy to better comprehend the system's behavior during the restoration of the network still considering the size of the largest connected component attacks.</description>

      <title>Filling in the Blanks? A Systematic Review and Theoretical Conceptualisation for Measuring WikiData Content Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wikidata is a collaborative knowledge graph which provides machine-readable structured data for Wikimedia projects including Wikipedia. Managed by a community of volunteers, it has grown to become the most edited Wikimedia project. However, it features a long-tail of items with limited data and a number of systematic gaps within the available content. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review aimed to understand the state of these content gaps within Wikidata. We propose a typology of gaps based on prior research and contribute a theoretical framework intended to conceptualise gaps and support their measurement. We also describe the methods and metrics present used within the literature and classify them according to our framework to identify overlooked gaps that might occur in Wikidata. We then discuss the implications for collaboration and editor activity within Wikidata as well as future research directions. Our results contribute to the understanding of quality, completeness and the impact of systematic biases within Wikidata and knowledge gaps more generally.</description>

      <title>Citation Parsing and Analysis with Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key type of resource needed to address global inequalities in knowledge production and dissemination is a tool that can support journals in understanding how knowledge circulates. The absence of such a tool has resulted in comparatively less information about networks of knowledge sharing in the Global South. In turn, this gap authorizes the exclusion of researchers and scholars from the South in indexing services, reinforcing colonial arrangements that de-center and minoritize those scholars. In order to support citation network tracking on a global scale, we investigate the capacity of open-weight language models to mark up manuscript citations in an indexable format. We assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations from preprints and published research papers. Then, we evaluated a number of open-weight language models on the annotation task. We find that, even out of the box, today's language models achieve high levels of accuracy on identifying the constituent components of each citation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the smallest model we evaluated, Qwen3-0.6B, can parse all fields with high accuracy in $2^5$ passes, suggesting that post-training is likely to be effective in producing small, robust citation parsing models. Such a tool could greatly improve the fidelity of citation networks and thus meaningfully improve research indexing and discovery, as well as further metascientific research.</description>

      <title>Scalable Graph Generative Modeling via Substructure Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) has been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance, limiting the viability of GNNs as backbones for graph foundation models. In this work, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable, transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node classification, graph classification, and transfer learning -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/G2PM.</description>

      <title>Urban transport systems shape experiences of social segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobility is a fundamental feature of human life, and through it our interactions with the world and people around us generate complex and consequential social phenomena. Social segregation, one such process, is increasingly acknowledged as a product of one's entire lived experience rather than mere residential location. Increasingly granular sources of data on human mobility have evidenced how segregation persists outside the home, in workplaces, cafes, and on the street. Yet there remains only a weak evidential link between the production of social segregation and urban policy. This study addresses this gap through an assessment of the role of the urban transportation systems in shaping social segregation. Using city-scale GPS mobility data and a novel probabilistic mobility framework, we establish social interactions at the scale of transportation infrastructure, by rail and bus service segment, individual roads, and city blocks. The outcomes show how social segregation is more than a single process in space, but varying by time of day, urban design and structure, and service design. These findings reconceptualize segregation as a product of likely encounters during one's daily mobility practice. We then extend these findings through exploratory simulations, highlighting how transportation policy to promote sustainable transport may have potentially unforeseen impacts on segregation. The study underscores that to understand social segregation and achieve positive social change urban policymakers must consider the broadest impacts of their interventions and seek to understand their impact on the daily lived experience of their citizens.</description>

      <title>Modeling Inequality in Complex Networks of Strategic Agents using Iterative Game-Theoretic Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transactions are an important aspect of human social life, and represent dynamic flow of information, intangible values, such as trust, as well as monetary and social capital. Although much research has been conducted on the nature of transactions in fields ranging from the social sciences to game theory, the systemic effects of different types of agents transacting in real-world social networks (often following a scale-free distribution) are not fully understood. A particular systemic measure that has not received adequate attention in the complex networks and game theory communities, is the Gini Coefficient, which is widely used in economics to quantify and understand wealth inequality. In part, the problem is a lack of experimentation using a replicable algorithm and publicly available data. Motivated by this problem, this article proposes a model and simulation algorithm, based on game theory, for quantifying the evolution of inequality in complex networks of strategic agents. Our results shed light on several complex drivers of inequality, even in simple, abstract settings, and exhibit consistency across networks with different origins and descriptions.</description>

      <title>Neural Influence Estimator: Towards Real-time Solutions to Influence Blocking Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time solutions to the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problems are crucial for promptly containing the spread of misinformation. However, achieving this goal is non-trivial, mainly because assessing the blocked influence of an IBM problem solution typically requires plenty of expensive Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). This work presents a novel approach that enables solving IBM problems with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges in seconds. The key idea is to construct a fast-to-evaluate surrogate model called neural influence estimator (NIE) offline as a substitute for the time-intensive MCSs, and then combine it with optimization algorithms to address IBM problems online. To this end, a learning problem is formulated to build the NIE that takes the false-and-true information instance as input, extracts features describing the topology and inter-relationship between two seed sets, and predicts the blocked influence. A well-trained NIE can generalize across different IBM problems given a social network, and can be readily combined with existing IBM optimization algorithms. The experiments on 25 IBM problems with up to millions of edges show that the NIE-based optimization method can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than MCSs-based optimization method to achieve the same optimization quality. Moreover, given a one-minute limit, the NIE-based method can solve IBM problems with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than what can be solved by existing methods.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Neighborhood Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize bounded-confidence models (BCMs) of opinion dynamics by incorporating neighborhood effects. In a BCM, interacting agents influence each other through dyadic influence if their opinions are sufficiently similar to each other. In our "neighborhood BCMs" (NBCMs), interacting agents are influenced both by each other's opinions and by the opinions of the agents in each other's neighborhoods. Our NBCMs thus include both the usual dyadic influence between agents and a "transitive influence", which encodes the influence of an agent's neighbors, when determining whether or not an interaction changes the opinions of agents. In this transitive influence, an individual's opinion is influenced by a neighbor when, on average, the opinions of the neighbor's neighbors are sufficiently similar to its own opinion. We formulate both neighborhood Deffuant--Weisbuch (NDW) and neighborhood Hegselmann--Krause (NHK) BCMs.
  We build further on our NBCMs by introducing a neighborhood-based network adaptation in which a network coevolves with agent opinions by changing its structure through "transitive homophily". In this network evolution, an agent breaks a tie to one of its neighbors and then rewires that tie to a new agent, with a preference for agents with a mean neighbor opinion that is closer to its own opinion. Using numerical simulations on a variety of types of networks, we explore how the qualitative opinion dynamics and network properties of our adaptive NDW model change as we adjust the relative proportions of dyadic and transitive influence. In our numerical experiments, we find that incorporating neighborhood effects into the opinion dynamics and the network-adaptation rewiring strategy tends to reduce the spectral gap and degree assortativity of networks.

Abstract: We examine gender differences in collaboration networks and academic career progression in physics. We use the likelihood and time to become a principal investigator (PI) and the length of an author's career to measure career progression. Utilising logistic regression and accelerated failure time models, we examine whether the effect of collaboration behaviour varies by gender. We find that, controlling for the number of publications, the relationship between collaborative behaviour and career progression is almost the same for men and women. Specifically, we find that those who eventually reach principal investigator (PI) status, tend to have published with more unique collaborators. In contrast, publishing repeatedly with the same highly interconnected collaborators and/or larger number of co-authors per publication is characteristic of shorter career lengths and not attaining PI status. We observe that women tend to collaborate in more tightly connected and larger groups than men. Finally, we observe that women are less likely to attain the status of PI throughout their careers and have a lower survival probability compared to men, which calls for policies to close this crucial gap.</description>
