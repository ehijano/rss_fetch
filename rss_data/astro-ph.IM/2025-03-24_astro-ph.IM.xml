      <title>Diving deep into the Milky Way using Anti-Reflection Coatings for Astronomical CCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report two anti-reflection (AR) coatings that give better quantum efficiency (QE) than the existing AR coating on the Gaia astrometric field (AF) CCDs. Light being the core of optical astronomy is extremely important for such missions, therefore, the QE of the devices that are used to capture it should be substantially high. To reduce the losses due to the reflection of light from the surface of the CCDs, AR coatings can be applied. Currently, the main component of the Gaia satellite, the AF CCDs use hafnium dioxide (HfO2) AR coating. In this paper, the ATLAS module of the SILVACO software has been employed for simulating and studying the AF CCD pixel structure and several AR coatings. Our findings evidently suggest that zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) will prove to be better AR coatings for broadband astronomical CCDs in the future and will open new avenues for understanding the evolution of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation Transport with Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel tensor network algorithm to solve the time-dependent, gray thermal radiation transport equation. The method invokes a tensor train (TT) decomposition for the specific intensity. The efficiency of this approach is dictated by the rank of the decomposition. When the solution is "low-rank," the memory footprint of the specific intensity solution vector may be significantly compressed. The algorithm, following a step-then-truncate approach of a traditional discrete ordinates method, operates directly on the compressed state vector thereby enabling large speedups for low-rank solutions. To achieve these speedups we rely on a recently developed rounding approach based on the Gram-SVD. We detail how familiar SN algorithms for (gray) thermal transport can be mapped to this TT framework and present several numerical examples testing both the optically thick and thin regimes. The TT framework finds low rank structure and supplies up to $\simeq$60$\times$ speedups and $\simeq$1000$\times$ compressions for problems demanding large angle counts, thereby enabling previously intractable SN calculations and supplying a promising avenue to mitigate ray effects.</description>

      <title>Spectral-line performance of low-frequency radio telescope arrays: SKA-Low stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of diffraction, reflection and mutual coupling on the spectral smoothness of radio telescopes becomes increasingly important at low frequencies, where the observing wavelength may be significant compared with the antenna or array dimensions. These effects are important for both traditional parabolic antennas, which are prone to the 'standing wave' phenomenon caused by interference between direct and scattered wavefronts, and aperture arrays, such as the SKA-Low, MWA, HERA, and LOFAR which have more complicated scattering geometries and added dependence on pointing direction (scan angle). Electromagnetic modelling of these effects is computationally intensive and often only possible at coarse frequency resolution. Therefore, using the example of SKA-Low station configurations, we investigate the feasibility of parameterising scattering matrices, and separating antenna and array contributions to telescope chromaticity. This allows deeper insights into the effect on spectral smoothness and frequency-dependent beam patterns of differing antenna configurations. Even for the complicated SKA-Low element design, band-limited delay-space techniques appear to produce similar results to brute-force electromagnetic models, and allow for faster computation of station beam hypercubes (position, frequency and polarisation-dependent point spread functions) at arbitrary spectral resolution. As such techniques could facilitate improvements in the design of low-frequency spectral-line surveys, we conduct a simulated Cosmic Dawn experiment using different observing techniques and station configurations.</description>

      <title>Solar Radio Burst Detection Based on Deformable DETR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar radio bursts (SRBs) detection is crucial for solar physics research and space weather forecasting. The main challenges faced are noise interference in the spectrum and the diversity of SRBs. However, most research focuses on classifying whether SRBs exist or detecting a single type of SRBs. Existing detection models exhibit deficiencies in the accuracy of SRBs detection. Moreover, existing detection models cannot effectively handle background noise interference in solar radio spectrograms and the significant scale variations among different burst types. This paper proposes a high-performance detection model for solar radio bursts (SRBs) based on Deformable DETR (DEtection TRansformers) called DETR4SBRs. Firstly, this study designed a scale sensitive attention (SSA) module better to address the scale variations of SRBs. Subsequently, this study introduced collaborative hybrid auxiliary training to mitigate the positive-negative sample imbalance issue in Deformable DETR. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mAP@50 of 83.5% and a recall rate of 99.4% on the SRBs dataset. Additionally, the model exhibits excellent noise-robust performance and can efficiently detect and locate Type II, III, IV, and V SRBs. The model proposed in this study provides robust support for preliminary solar radio burst data processing and has significant implications for space weather forecasting. The source code and data are available on the https://github.com/onewangqianqian/SSA-Co-Deformable-DETR.git and archived on Zenodo.</description>

      <title>The Phase Induced Amplitude Apodizer and Nuller -- High transmission, high dispersion coronagraphy at 2{\lambda}/D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Proxima Cen b is the prime target for the search of life around a nearby exoplanet by characterizing its atmosphere in reflected light. Due to the very high star/companion contrast (&lt;1E-6), High Dispersion Coronagraphy is the most promising technique to perform such a characterization. Aims. With a maximum separation of 37 mas, Proxima b can be observed with a VLT in the visible. It requires a coronagraph providing high contrast (&lt; 1E-4 ) very close from the star (&lt; 2 {\lambda}/D ) over a broad spectral range (~30%), with a high transmission of the companion (&gt; 50%). We look for an optimal solution that takes benefit of the properties of single-mode fibers. Methods. We introduce the Phase Induced Amplitude Apodizer and Nuller (PIAAN), a coronagraphic integral field unit, designed to feed a diffraction limited spectrograph. It uses a pupil remapping optics with moderate apodization, combined to a single mode fiber integral field unit. It exploits the properties of single mode fibers to null the star light without reducing the companion coupling. The study focuses on a proper tolerance analysis and proposes a wavefront optimization strategy. A prototype is built to demonstrate its performance. Results. We show that the PIAAN can theoretically provide contrasts of 7E-7 and a transmission of 72% at 2 {\lambda}/D over a bandwidth of 30%. A prototype is built and characterized and the proposed wavefront control strategy is also demonstrated in the lab. We reach contrast levels of 3E-5 over the full bandwidth, as expected from the tolerance analysis. Conclusions. We demonstrated the potential of the new PIAAN coronagraph, from simulations to prototype. Its performance will eventually be limited by the XAO capabilities. It is the main coronagraph candidate for the RISTRETTO instrument to observe Proxima Cen b on the VLT and its first technology milestone.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Emulation of Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network-based emulators for the inference of stellar parameters and elemental abundances represent an increasingly popular methodology in modern spectroscopic surveys. However, these approaches are often constrained by their emulation precision and domain transfer capabilities. Greater generalizability has previously been achieved only with significantly larger model architectures, as demonstrated by Transformer-based models in natural language processing. This observation aligns with neural scaling laws, where model performance predictably improves with increased model size, computational resources allocated to model training, and training data volume. In this study, we demonstrate that these scaling laws also apply to Transformer-based spectral emulators in astronomy. Building upon our previous work with TransformerPayne and incorporating Maximum Update Parametrization techniques from natural language models, we provide training guidelines for scaling models to achieve optimal performance. Our results show that within the explored parameter space, clear scaling relationships emerge. These findings suggest that optimal computational resource allocation requires balanced scaling. Specifically, given a tenfold increase in training compute, achieving an optimal seven-fold reduction in mean squared error necessitates an approximately 2.5-fold increase in dataset size and a 3.8-fold increase in model size. This study establishes a foundation for developing spectral foundational models with enhanced domain transfer capabilities.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based identification of precipitation clouds from all-sky camera data for observatory safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For monitoring the night sky conditions, wide-angle all-sky cameras are used in most astronomical observatories to monitor the sky cloudiness. In this manuscript, we apply a deep-learning approach for automating the identification of precipitation clouds in all-sky camera data as a cloud warning system. We construct our original training and test sets using the all-sky camera image archive of the Iranian National Observatory (INO). The training and test set images are labeled manually based on their potential rainfall and their distribution in the sky. We train our model on a set of roughly 2445 images taken by the INO all-sky camera through the deep learning method based on the EfficientNet network. Our model reaches an average accuracy of 99\% in determining the cloud rainfall's potential and an accuracy of 96\% for cloud coverage. To enable a comprehensive comparison and evaluate the performance of alternative architectures for the task, we additionally trained three models LeNet, DeiT, and AlexNet. This approach can be used for early warning of incoming dangerous clouds toward telescopes and harnesses the power of deep learning to automatically analyze vast amounts of all-sky camera data and accurately identify precipitation clouds formations. Our trained model can be deployed for real-time analysis, enabling the rapid identification of potential threats, and offering a scaleable solution that can improve our ability to safeguard telescopes and instruments in observatories. This is important now that numerous small and medium-sized telescopes are increasingly integrated with smart control systems to reduce manual operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the multiplexing power of spectroscopic instruments increases, so does the need for automated analysis. In practice, the bottleneck for speed is the calculation of model spectra to evaluate the likelihood of candidate parameters. This presentation gives an overview of the steps required for automating spectroscopic analyses, focusing on the speedups achievable by precomputing regular grids of synthetic spectra for on-the-fly interpolation, and a new technique based on precomputed irregular grids capable of tackling problems with much higher dimensionality, as in the case when we are interested in deriving the abundances of multiple elements. Accuracy, ease of use and portability will be discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study presents an effective approach for deriving and utilizing polarity-based cross-correlation functions to forecast Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) fluxes based on solar activity proxies. By leveraging a universal correlation framework calibrated with AMS-02 and PAMELA proton flux data under a numerical model, the methodology incorporates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and a global spline fit. These techniques ensure robust handling of short-term fluctuations and smooth transitions during polarity reversals. The results have significant potential for space weather applications, enabling reliable GCR flux predictions critical for radiation risk assessments and operational planning in space exploration and satellite missions.</description>

      <title>Extinction Distributions in Nearby Star-resolved Galaxies. I. M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extinction distribution of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is constructed with member stars as tracers by fitting multiband photometric data from UKIRT/WFCAM, PS1, and Gaia DR3. The resulting extinction distribution covers approximately 10 deg$^2$ of M31 with a resolution of approximately 50 arcsec, providing the largest coverage to date based on stellar observations. The derived average extinction, $A_V = 1.17$ mag, agrees well with previous studies. To account for foreground extinction, an extinction map of the Milky Way toward M31 with a resolution of $\sim$ 1.7 arcmin is also constructed, yielding an average extinction of $A_V \approx 0.185$ mag. The results offer a valuable tool for extinction correction in future observations, such as those from the China Space Station Telescope, and provide insights for improving dust models based on the spatial distribution of dust in galaxies like M31.</description>

      <title>Future Collider Measurements for Cosmic Ray Induced Air Shower Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of gamma-ray induced air showers with Cherenkov telescopes suffers from contamination with a specific class of cosmic ray induced air showers. The predictions for this background show strong discrepancies between the available event generators. In this study, we identify collision events of cosmic rays with atmospheric nuclei in which a large fraction of the original beam energy is transmitted to the electromagnetic part of the shower as the main source for this background. Consequently, we define a pseudorapidity region of interest for hadron collider experiments that corresponds to this background, taking into account the center-of-mass energy. This region of interest is compared with the available datasets and the pseudorapidity coverage of the detectors that recorded it. We find that the LHCf and RHICf detectors are the only ones covering substantial parts of this region of interest and suggest a measurement of the energy spectra of reconstructed neutral pions to be made with this data. Such results could serve as valuable constraints for a future parameter tuning of the event generators to improve the background estimation uncertainties for gamma-ray induced air shower identification.</description>

      <title>Detection method for periodic radio emissions from an exoplanet's magnetosphere or a star-planet interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for exoplanetary or star-planet interaction radio signals is a major challenge, as it is one of the only way of detecting a planetary magnetic field. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of using statistical tools to detect periodic radio signals in unevenly spaced observations. Identification of periodic radio signal is achieved here by a Lomb-Scargle analysis. We first apply the technique on simulated astrophysical observations with controlled simulated noise. This allows for characterizing of spurious detection peaks in the resulting periodograms, as well as identifying peaks due to resonance or beat periods. We then validate this method on a real signal, using ~1400 hours of data from observations of Jupiter's radio emissions by the NenuFAR radio telescope over more than six years to detect jovian radio emissions periodicities (auroral and induced by the Galilean moons). We demonstrate with the simulation that the Lomb-Scargle periodogram allows to correctly identify periodic radio signal, even in a diluted signal. On real measurements, it correctly detects the rotation period of the strong signal produced by Jupiter and the synodic period of the emission triggered by the interaction between Jupiter and its Galilean moon Io, but also maybe weaker signal such as the one produced by the interaction between Jupiter and Europa or between Jupiter and Ganymede. It is important to note that secondary peaks in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram will be observed at the synodic and resonance periods between all the detected signal periodicities (i.e. real signals, but also periodicities in the observation). These secondary peaks can then be used to strengthen the detections of weak signals.</description>

      <title>A continuous multiple hypothesis testing framework for optimal exoplanet detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.04957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When searching for exoplanets, one wants to count how many planets orbit a given star, and to determine what their characteristics are. If the estimated planet characteristics are too far from those of a planet truly present, this should be considered as a false detection. This setting is a particular instance of a general one: aiming to retrieve parametric components in a dataset corrupted by nuisance signals, with a certain accuracy on their parameters. We exhibit a detection criterion minimizing false and missed detections, either as a function of their relative cost or when the expected number of false detections is bounded. If the components can be separated in a technical sense discussed in detail, the optimal detection criterion is a posterior probability obtained as a by-product of Bayesian evidence calculations. Optimality is guaranteed within a model, and we introduce model criticism methods to ensure that the criterion is robust to model errors. We show on two simulations emulating exoplanet searches that the optimal criterion can significantly outperform other criteria. Finally, we show that our framework offers solutions for the identification of components of mixture models and Bayesian false discovery rate control when hypotheses are not discrete.</description>

      <title>ContEvol formalism: numerical methods based on Hermite spline optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the ContEvol (continuous evolution) formalism, a family of implicit numerical methods which only need to solve linear equations and are almost symplectic. Combining values and derivatives of functions, ContEvol outputs allow users to recover full history and render full distributions. Using classic harmonic oscillator as a prototype case, we show that ContEvol methods lead to lower-order errors than two commonly used Runge--Kutta methods. Applying first-order ContEvol to simple celestial mechanics problems, we demonstrate that deviation from equation(s) of motion of ContEvol tracks is still $\mathcal{O}(h^5)$ ($h$ is the step length) by our definition. Numerical experiments with an eccentric elliptical orbit indicate that first-order ContEvol is a viable alternative to classic Runge--Kutta or the symplectic leapfrog integrator. Solving stationary Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics, we manifest ability of ContEvol to handle boundary value or eigenvalue problems. Important directions for future work, including mathematical foundation, higher dimensions, and technical improvements, are discussed at the end of this article.</description>

      <title>New high-precision measurement system for electron-positron pairs from sub-GeV/GeV gamma-rays in the emulsion telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GRAINE project observes cosmic gamma-rays, using a balloon-borne emulsion-film-based telescope in the sub-GeV/GeV energy band. We reported in our previous balloon experiment in 2018, GRAINE2018, the detection of the known brightest source, Vela pulsar, with the highest angular resolution ever reported in an energy range of $&gt;$80 MeV. However, the emulsion scanning system used in the experiment was designed to achieve a high-speed scanning, and it was not accurate enough to ensure the optimum spacial resolution of the emulsion film and limited the performance. Here, we report a new high-precision scanning system that can be used to greatly improve the observation result of GRAINE2018 and also be employed in future experiments. The system involves a new algorithm that recognizes each silver grain on an emulsion film and is capable of measuring tracks with a positional resolution for the passing points of tracks of almost the same as the intrinsic resolution of nuclear emulsion film ($\sim$70 nm). This resolution is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that obtained with the high-speed scanning system. With this system, an angular resolution for gamma-rays of 0.1$^\circ$ at 1 GeV is expected to be achieved. Furthermore, we successfully combine the new high-precision system with the existing high-speed system, establishing the system to make a high-speed and high-precision measurement. Employing these systems, we reanalyze the gamma-ray events detected previously by only the high-speed system in GRAINE2018 and obtain an about three times higher angular resolution (0.22$^\circ$) in 500--700 MeV than the original value. The high-resolution observation may bring new insights into the gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center region and may realize polarization measurements of high-energy cosmic gamma-rays.</description>

      <title>Development of an MKID frequency-to-pixel LED mapper for SPT-3G+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SPT-3G+ is the next-generation camera for the South Pole Telescope (SPT). SPT is designed to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the mm/sub-mm sky. The planned focal plane consists of 34,000 microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), divided among three observing bands centered at 220, 285, and 345 GHz. Each readout line is designed to measure 800 MKIDs over a 500 MHz bandwidth, which places stringent constraints on the accuracy of the frequency placement required to limit resonator collisions that reduce the overall detector yield. To meet this constraint, we are developing a two-step process that first optically maps the resonance to a physical pixel location, and then next trims the interdigitated capacitor (IDC) to adjust the resonator frequency. We present a cryogenic LED apparatus operable at 300 mK for the optical illumination of SPT-3G+ detector arrays. We demonstrate integration of the LED controls with the GHz readout electronics (RF-ICE) to take data on an array of prototype SPT-3G+ detectors. We show that this technique is useful for characterizing defects in the resonator frequency across the detector array and will allow for improvements in the detector yield.</description>

      <title>The LSPE-Strip Pointing Reconstruction and Star Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to describe the Pointing Reconstruction Model (PRM) and the prototype Star Tracker, which will be mounted on LSPE-Strip, a microwave Q- and W-band CMB telescope planned for installation at the "Observatorio del Teide" in Tenerife. The PRM integrates information on the instantaneous attitude provided by the telescope control system to determine the actual pointing direction and focal plane orientation of the telescope. It accounts for various non-idealities in the telescope setup, represented by eight configuration angles, which will be calibrated using the Star Tracker. Following the derivation of the PRM formalism and its implementation, we investigate the pointing errors caused by incorrect calibration of these configuration angles to validate the required 1 arcminute maximum systematic pointing error for the LSPE-Strip survey. This paper also describes the main structure and operations of the Star Tracker and presents the results of a campaign of actual sky observations conducted with a prototype. The results demonstrate a Star Tracker RMS accuracy of approximately 3 arcseconds, while systematic errors remain below 10 arcseconds. Based on these results, we analyzed the problem of reconstructing the PRM configuration angles. Two methods for intercalibrating the Star Tracker's pointing direction with respect to the focal plane's pointing direction were examined: (1) observations of planets and (2) observations of a drone carrying both an optical beacon and a radio beacon. In the first case, an intercalibration accuracy between 1/3 arcminute and 1 arcminute is achievable. In the second case, the expected intercalibration accuracy ranges from 0.25 arcminute to 1 arcminute.</description>

      <title>Cryoscope: A Cryogenic Infrared Survey Telescope in Antarctica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Cryoscope--a new 50 deg$^2$ field-of-view, 1.2 m aperture, $K_{dark}$ survey telescope to be located at Dome C, Antarctica. Cryoscope has an innovative optical-thermal design wherein the entire telescope is cryogenically cooled. Cryoscope also explores new detector technology to cost-effectively tile the full focal plane. Leveraging the dark Antarctic sky and minimizing telescope thermal emission, Cryoscope achieves unprecedented deep, wide, fast and red observations, matching and exceeding volumetric survey speeds from the Ultraviolet Explorer, Vera Rubin Observatory, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, and NEO Surveyor. By providing coverage beyond wavelengths of 2 $\mu$m, we aim to create the most comprehensive dynamic movie of the most obscured reaches of the Universe. Cryoscope will be a dedicated discovery engine for electromagnetic emission from coalescing compact binaries, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting cold stars, and multiple facets of time-domain, stellar and solar system science. In this paper, we describe the scientific drivers and technical innovations for this new discovery engine operating in the $K_{dark}$ passband, why we choose to deploy it in Antarctica, and the status of a fifth-scale prototype designed as a Pathfinder to retire technological risks prior to full-scale implementation. We plan to deploy the Cryoscope Pathfinder to Dome C in December 2026 and the full-scale telescope by 2030.</description>

      <title>Validating Prior-informed Fisher-matrix Analyses against GWTC Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fisher-matrix methods are widely used to predict how accurately parameters can be estimated. Being computationally efficient, this approach is prompted by the large number of signals simulated in forecast studies for future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, for which adequate analysis tools and computational resources are still unavailable to the scientific community. However, approximating the full likelihood function with a Gaussian may lead to inaccuracies, which we investigate in this work. To assess the accuracy of the Fisher approximation, we compare the results of the Fisher code GWFish against real data from the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs (GWTCs) provided by the Virgo/LIGO Bayesian analyses. Additionally, we present a sampling algorithm to include priors in GWFish, not only to ensure a fair comparison between GWFish results and the Virgo/LIGO posteriors but also to investigate the role of prior information and to assess the need to include it in standard Fisher analyses. We find that the impact of priors depends mostly on the level of signal-dependent degeneracy of the waveform parameterization, and priors are generally more important when the level of degeneracy is high. Our findings imply that Fisher-matrix methods are a valid tool for ET science-case studies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Massive Black Hole Binary parameter estimation for LISA using Sequential Neural Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inspiral, merger, and ringdown of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs) is one the main sources of Gravitational Waves (GWs) for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA-led mission in the implementation phase. It is expected that LISA will detect these systems throughout the entire observable universe. Robust and efficient data analysis algorithms are necessary to detect and estimate physical parameters for these systems. In this work, we explore the application of Sequential Neural Likelihood, a simulation-based inference algorithm, to detect and characterize MBHB GW signals in synthetic LISA data. We describe in detail the different elements of the method, their performance and possible alternatives that can be used to enhance the performance. Instead of sampling from the conventional likelihood function, which requires a forward simulation for each evaluation, this method constructs a surrogate likelihood that is ultimately described by a neural network trained from a dataset of simulations of the MBHB signals and noise. One important advantage of this method is that, given that the likelihood is independent of the priors, we can iteratively train models that target specific observations in a fraction of the time and computational cost that other traditional and machine learning-based strategies would require. Because of the iterative nature of the method, we are able to train models to obtain qualitatively similar posteriors with less than 2\% of the simulator calls that Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods would require. We compare these posteriors with those obtained from Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques and discuss the differences that appear, in particular in relation with the important role that data compression has in the modular implementation of the method that we present. We also discuss different strategies to improve the performance of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter. However, their analysis requires substantial computational resources due to the challenges in Bayesian stochastic sampling. The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect BNS signals with significantly increased signal duration, detection rates, and signal strength, leading to a major computational burden in the 3G era. We demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compressions on the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inferences. Given that full Bayesian analysis is prohibitively time-intensive, we validate our model against (semi-)analytical predictions. Additionally, we estimate the computational demands of BNS signal analysis in the 3G era, showing that the machine learning methods will be crucial for future catalog-level analysis.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e: 1D Forward Model Grid for Current and Future JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations with NIRCam and MIRI of the ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e indicate a possible volatile atmosphere surrounding the planet. Previous analysis of the NIRCam spectra suggested potential absorption features from CO2 or CO and significant sub-weekly variability. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum does not contain substantial features but was found to be consistent with effective heat redistribution models. In this work, we computed a grid of over 25000 self-consistent 1D forward models incorporating H-N-O-C-S-P-Si-Ti equilibrium chemistry and assessed plausible atmospheric compositions based on the current JWST data. Despite exhaustive analysis, the composition and properties of the atmosphere remain elusive. While our results statistically favour a global, hydrogen-free, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere enriched in PO and CO2, various alternative compositions, including H2O-,CO-, PH3-, or Si-bearing remain viable explanations. Unconstrained heat redistribution efficiency and absolute NIRCam flux are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We also find that the heat redistribution factor and surface pressure are highly degenerate with atmospheric composition, and that these parameters cannot be independently constrained using current JWST observations. Furthermore, we show that the observed variability may arise from dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and an underlying magma ocean, driving rapid shifts in atmospheric chemistry and thermal emission. Our results highlight the importance of using self-consistent forward models when analysing novel JWST spectra with limited signal-to-noise ratios -- such as those of 55 Cancri e -- as it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of potential atmospheric scenarios while also being less sensitive to subtle spectral differences than retrievals...</description>
