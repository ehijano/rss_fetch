      <title>Merging Galaxies in Isolated Environments II. Evolution of Star Formation and Accretion Activity during the Merging Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now well known that certain massive galaxies undergo enormous enhancements in their SFR when they undergo major mergers(100x). To analyse the SF enhancement and AGN fraction evolution during the merger process, we use a more timeline-like merger sequence. Also, to determine the relation between the SF enhancement in mergers and the morphology of the galaxies involved. Taking advantage of the Mstr and SFR of 600 nearby isolated mergers from our previous study, we calculate the distance of our galaxies from the SF MS, which we refer to as SFmode. We analyse how the SFmode varies during the merger process, for morphology and Mstr. We also analyse the AGN content of our mergers, using multiple diagnostics based on emission line ratios and WISE colours. We observe that, overall, merging galaxies show a SFmode that is governed by their morphology. Spirals typically show high SFmode values while highly-disturbed galaxies are generally even more enhanced (0.8dex and 1dex above the MS, resp). On the contrary, elliptical and lenticular galaxies show the lowest SF modes, as expected. However, even they show SF enhancement compared to their unperturbed counterparts (their median SFmode is within the 1-sigma scatter of the MS, and this can occur even before the galaxies have coalesced). We see a trend for SFmode to gradually increase with increasing merger stage. We do not find a clear dependency of the observed AGN fraction on merger stage for the majority of our classification methods. We find mergers can significantly enhance SF in galaxies of all morphologies. For early-type galaxies, this could suggest that some gas was present prior to the merger which may be triggered to form stars by the tidal interaction. As the SF enhancement continues throughout the merger process, this suggests that the enhancement may be a long-lived event, contrary to the short starbursts seen in some models.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: Public data release of ~1800 HI sources and high-resolution cut-outs from Pilot Survey Phase 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Pilot Survey Phase 2 data release for the Wide-field ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY), carried-out using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). We present 1760 HI detections (with a default spatial resolution of 30") from three pilot fields including the NGC 5044 and NGC 4808 groups as well as the Vela field, covering a total of ~180 deg$^2$ of the sky and spanning a redshift up to $z \simeq 0.09$. This release also includes kinematic models for over 126 spatially resolved galaxies. The observed median rms noise in the image cubes is 1.7 mJy per 30" beam and 18.5 kHz channel. This corresponds to a 5$\sigma$ HI column density sensitivity of $\sim 9.1\times10^{19}(1 + z)^4$ cm$^{-2}$ per 30" beam and $\sim 20$ km/s channel, and a 5$\sigma$ HI mass sensitivity of $\sim 5.5\times10^8 (D/100$ Mpc)$^{2}$ M$_{\odot}$ for point sources. Furthermore, we also present for the first time 12" high-resolution images ("cut-outs") and catalogues for a sub-sample of 80 sources from the Pilot Survey Phase 2 fields. While we are able to recover sources with lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to sources in the Public Data Release 1, we do note that some data quality issues still persist, notably, flux discrepancies that are linked to the impact of side lobes associated with the dirty beams due to inadequate deconvolution. However, in spite of these limitations, the WALLABY Pilot Survey Phase 2 has already produced roughly a third of the number of HIPASS sources, making this the largest spatially resolved HI sample from a single survey to date.</description>

      <title>Fast Outflow in the Host Galaxy of the Luminous z $=$ 7.5 Quasar J1007$+$2115</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope opens a new window to directly probe luminous quasars powered by billion solar mass black holes in the epoch of reionization and their co-evolution with massive galaxies with unprecedented details. In this paper, we report the first results from the deep NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy study of a quasar at $z = 7.5$. We obtain a bolometric luminosity of $\sim$$1.8\times10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a black hole mass of $\sim$0.7--2.5$\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ based on H$\beta$ emission line from the quasar spectrum. We discover $\sim$2 kpc scale, highly blueshifted ($\sim$$-$870 km/s) and broad ($\sim$1400 km/s) [O III] line emission after the quasar PSF has been subtracted. Such line emission most likely originates from a fast, quasar-driven outflow, the earliest one on galactic-scale known so far. The dynamical properties of this outflow fall within the typical ranges of quasar-driven outflows at lower redshift, and the outflow may be fast enough to reach the circumgalactic medium. Combining both the extended and nuclear outflow together, the mass outflow rate, $\sim$300 M$_{\odot}$yr, is $\sim$60%--380% of the star formation rate of the quasar host galaxy, suggesting that the outflow may expel a significant amount of gas from the inner region of the galaxy. The kinetic energy outflow rate, $\sim$3.6$\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, is $\sim$0.2% of the quasar bolometric luminosity, which is comparable to the minimum value required for negative feedback based on simulation predictions. The dynamical timescale of the extended outflow is $\sim$1.7 Myr, consistent with the typical quasar lifetime in this era.</description>

      <title>Correlations of Methyl Formate (CH3OCHO), Dimethyl Ether (CH3OCH3) and Ketene (H2CCO) in High-mass Star-forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-spatial-resolution (0.7 to 1.0 arcsec) submillimeter observations of continuum and molecular lines of CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and H2CCO toward 11 high-mass star-forming regions using the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA). A total of 19 separate cores from 9 high-mass star-forming regions are found to be line-rich, including high-, intermediate-, and low-mass line-rich cores. The three molecules are detected in these line-rich cores. We map the emission of CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and H2CCO in 9 high-mass star-forming regions. The spatial distribution of the three molecules is very similar and concentrated in the areas of intense continuum emission. We also calculate the rotation temperatures, column densities, and abundances of CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and H2CCO under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption. The abundances relative to H2 and CH3OH, and line widths of the three molecules are significantly correlated. The abundances relative to H2, temperatures and line widths of the three molecules tend to be higher in cores with higher mass and outflows detected. The possible chemical links of the three molecules are discussed.</description>

      <title>A survey of sulfur-bearing molecular lines toward the dense cores in eleven massive protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur-bearing molecules are commonly detected in dense cores within star-forming regions, but the total sulfur budget is significantly low, when compared to the interstellar medium (ISM) value. The properties of sulfur-bearing molecules are not well understood due to the absence of large sample studies with uniform observational configurations. To deepen our understanding of this subject, we conducted a study using ALMA 870 \micron~observations of 11 massive protoclusters. By checking the spectra of 248 dense cores in 11 massive protoclusters, a total of 10 sulfur-bearing species (CS, SO, \htcs, NS, \sot, \ttso, \tfsot, \ttsot, \seoo, \octfs) were identified. The parameters including systemic velocities, line widths, gas temperatures, column densities, and abundances were derived. Our results indicate that SO appears to be more easily detected in a wider range of physical environments than \htcs, despite these two species show similarities in gas distributions and abundances. \tfsot~and \htcs~are good tracers of the temperature of sulfur-bearing species, in which \htcs~traces the outer warm envelope and \tfsot~is associated with high-temperature central-regions. High-mass star-forming feedback (outflow and other non-thermal motions) significantly elevates the sulfur-bearing molecular abundances and detection rates specifically for \sot~and SO. A positive correlation between the \sot~abundance increasing factor ($F$) and temperatures suggests that \sot~could serve as a sulfur reservoir on the grain mantles of dense cores and then can be desorbed from dust to gas phase as the temperature rises. This work shows the importance of a large and unbiased survey to understand the sulfur depletion in dense cores.</description>

      <title>Slow and steady does the trick: Slow outflows enhance the fragmentation of molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most massive galaxies host a supermassive black hole at their centre. Matter accretion creates an active galactic nucleus (AGN), forming a relativistic particle wind. The wind heats and pushes the interstellar medium, producing galactic-wide outflows. Fast outflows remove the gas from galaxies and quench star formation, and while slower ($v&lt;500$ km s$^{-1}$) outflows are ubiquitous, their effect is less clear but can be both positive and negative. We wish to understand the conditions required for positive feedback. We investigated the effect that slow and warm-hot outflows have on the dense gas clouds in the host galaxy. We aim to constrain the region of outflow and cloud parameter space, if any, where the passage of the outflow enhances star formation. We used numerical simulations of virtual `wind tunnels' to investigate the interaction of isolated turbulent spherical clouds ($10^{3;4;5}$ M$_{\odot}$) with slow outflows ($10$ km s$^{-1} - 400$ km s$^{-1}$) spanning a wide range of temperatures ($10^{4;5;6}$ K). We find that warm outflows compress the clouds and enhance gas fragmentation at velocities ${\leq}200$ km s$^{-1}$, while hot ($T_{\rm out} = 10^6$ K) outflows increase fragmentation rates even at moderate velocities of $400$ km s$^{-1}$. Cloud acceleration, on the other hand, is typically inefficient, with dense gas only attaining velocities of ${&lt;}0.1 v_{\rm out}$. We suggest three primary scenarios where positive feedback on star formation is viable: stationary cloud compression by slow outflows in low-powered AGN, sporadic enhancement in shear flow layers formed by luminous AGN, and self-compression in fragmenting AGN-driven outflows. Our results are consistent with current observational constraints and with previous works investigating triggered star formation in these disparate domains.</description>

      <title>Preparation for CSST: Star-galaxy Classification using a Rotationally Invariant Supervised Machine Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing star-galaxy classifiers depend on the reduced information from catalogs, necessitating careful data processing and feature extraction. In this study, we employ a supervised machine learning method (GoogLeNet) to automatically classify stars and galaxies in the COSMOS field. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, we introduce several preprocessing techniques, including noise reduction and the unwrapping of denoised images in polar coordinates, applied to our carefully selected samples of stars and galaxies. By dividing the selected samples into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio, we evaluate the performance of the GoogLeNet model in distinguishing between stars and galaxies. The results indicate that the GoogLeNet model is highly effective, achieving accuracies of 99.6% and 99.9% for stars and galaxies, respectively. Furthermore, by comparing the results with and without preprocessing, we find that preprocessing can significantly improve classification accuracy (by approximately 2.0% to 6.0%) when the images are rotated. In preparation for the future launch of the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), we also evaluate the performance of the GoogLeNet model on the CSST simulation data. These results demonstrate a high level of accuracy (approximately 99.8%), indicating that this model can be effectively utilized for future observations with the CSST.</description>

      <title>Measuring Mass of Gas in Central Galaxies using weak lensing and satellite kinematics in MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) framework, the dynamical mass of a galaxy is fully determined by its baryonic matter distribution. We fit the distribution of cold and hot gas halos, focusing on hot gas, around SDSS central galaxies using weak lensing signals from the DECaLS survey in MOND. The central galaxies are classified into two samples, the total galaxies and star-forming galaxies. We find that hot gas halo densities nearly follow Plummer's profile for both samples across all mass bins. The rotation curves of the galaxy samples are also demonstrated. The efficiency of converting gas into stars, $M_*/(M_* + M_{\rm g})$, is between 0.3 and 0.8 in all mass bins of the star-forming sample, which is higher than in the total sample. We also calculate gas mass using the satellite kinematics method in MOND. A constant, mildly radial anisotropy or isotropy in satellite motion leads to good agreement between the satellite kinematics and weak lensing methods. Combining both methods, we observe a baryonic mass to line-of-sight velocity dispersion of satellites ($M_{\rm b}$-$\sigma_{\rm s}$) relation. In addition, we examine more sophisticated models in MOND, including external field effects and Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy profiles, and find them unnecessary. A simple, mildly radial constant anisotropic model or an isotropic model, even when isolated, already aligns with observations. The strong concordance between the two methods suggests that weak lensing signals reliably measure the dynamical mass of central galaxies and can constrain the distribution of missing baryons in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Estimating Dust Attenuation From Galactic Spectra. III. Radial variations of dust attenuation scaling relations in MaNGA galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radial dependence of the scaling relations of dust attenuation in nearby galaxies using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data from MaNGA. We identify ionized gas regions of kpc sizes from MaNGA galaxies, and for each region we estimate both the stellar attenuation $E(B-V)_{\rm star}$ and gas attenuation $E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$. We then quantify the correlations of 15 regional/global properties with $E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$ and $E(B-V)_{\rm star}$, using both the feature importance obtained with the Random Forest regression technique and the Spearman correlation coefficients. The importance of stellar mass, metallicity and nebular velocity dispersion found previously from SDSS-based studies can be reproduced if our analysis is limited to the central region of galaxies. The scaling relations of both $E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$ and $E(B-V)_{\rm star}$ are found to strongly vary as one goes from the galactic center to outer regions, and from H$\alpha$-bright regions to H$\alpha$-faint regions. For $E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$, [NII]/[SII] is top ranked with a much higher correlation coefficient than any other property at $0&lt;R\lesssim R_e$, while [OIII]/[OII] outperforms [NII]/[SII] as the leading property in the outermost region. For $E(B-V)_{\rm star}$, stellar age shows the strongest correlation with no/weak dependence on radial distance, although $\rm \Sigma_{H\alpha}$ and sSFR present similarly strong correlations with $E(B-V)_{\rm star}$ in the galactic center. We find H$\alpha$-bright regions to generally show stronger correlations with $E(B-V)_{\rm gas}$, while H$\alpha$-faint regions are more strongly correlated with $E(B-V)_{\rm star}$, although depending on individual properties and radial distance. The implications of our results on studies of high-$z$ galaxies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Searching For JWST's Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a previously hidden population of extremely bright and compact objects between redshifts of $z \sim 4$ and $z \sim 10$. Given their extreme red colouring in the observed frame these galaxies have been dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs). The aim of this project was to identify LRDs using photometric data from previously uninvestigated JWST datasets and to estimate their AGN fractions by fitting the spectral energy distribution of each galaxy against well calibrated templates using CIGALE. We identified a list of potential LRDs using a single colour cut of F444W-F277W $&gt;$1.5 mag and by applying a morphological analysis. We used EAZY to estimate the (photometric) redshift and CIGALE to estimate the AGN fraction of each LRD. Overall, we identified 14 LRDs, applying accurate SED fits to 11 of them. We found that 7 of them had a high AGN fraction (with the AGN component generating more than 50\% of the observed flux), a further two LRDs had AGN contribution in excess of approximately 40\%. In total nine LRDs (our of 14) are likely to have a supermassive black hole in their centre. Interestingly, the three LRDs which could not be well fit by CIGALE displayed extremely high photometric redshifts ($z_{phot} \gtrsim 11$) and require further analysis (and may also host a supermassive black hole in their centre).</description>

      <title>Investigating C-Doop vibrational modes in PAHs as a tool to study interstellar deuterium-containing PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAHs-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative way is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated or deuteronated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out of plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes belonging to PAHs with single to multiple deuteration in the same ring are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. We found that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at 14-19 micron range, which does not overlap with the region attributed to C-Hoop modes. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to D/H in PAHs. In addition, new C-Hoop modes also appear due to the creation of new C-H bonds upon deuteration of duet, trio, and quartet C-H sites. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.</description>

      <title>Binary Disruption and Ejected Stars from Hierarchical Star Cluster Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate mergers between star clusters embedded within their natal giant molecular cloud. We extract initial conditions from cloud-scale simulations of cluster formation and introduce different prescriptions for primordial binaries. We find that simulations that do not include primordial binaries result in a larger fraction of unbound stars than simulations which include a prescription for binaries based on observations. We also find a preferred direction of motion for stars that become unbound during the merger. Sub-cluster mergers within realistic gas environments promote binary disruption while mergers between idealized, gas-rich spherical clusters do not produce the same disruption. Binary systems with smaller semi-major axes are disrupted in simulations of sub-cluster mergers within their natal environment compared to simulations that do not include the realistic gas environment. We conclude that binary disruption and the production of an anisotropic distribution of unbound stars are the natural consequences of sub-cluster mergers during star cluster assembly.</description>

      <title>UVIT Study of the MAgellanic Clouds (U-SMAC) II. A Far-UV catalog of the Small Magellanic Cloud: Morphology and Kinematics of young stellar population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is an irregular dwarf galaxy that has recently undergone an interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud. The young massive stars in the SMC formed in the disturbed low-metallicity environment are important targets in astrophysics. We present a catalog of $\sim$ 76,800 far ultraviolet (FUV) sources towards the SMC detected using the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. We created an FUV catalog with $\sim$ 62900 probable SMC members which predominantly comprise main-sequence, giant, and subgiant stars. We selected 4 young populations (Young 1, Young 2, Young 3, and Blue Loop (BL) stars) identified from the Gaia optical color-magnitude diagram to study the morphology and kinematics of the young SMC using this catalog. We detect a clumpy morphology with a broken bar, a shell-like structure, and the inner SMC Wing for the 4 stellar populations. The eastern region and the northeastern regions are mainly populated by Young 1, 2, and 3. The central region predominantly has the Young 2 and 3 populations, whereas the SW has BL stars, Young 2 and 3. The 2-D kinematic study using proper motion (PM) reveals that Young 2 and 3 populations show two kinematically distinct sub-populations with low and high PM dispersion, whereas the Young 1 and BL stars show two kinematically distinct populations with low dispersion. Our analysis points to a kinematic disturbance along the RA direction for stars younger than $\sim$ 150 Myr located in the eastern region, with no significant disturbance along the Declination.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Forming Nucleus in the Fourcade-Figueroa Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze data from the IRAS, WISE, and Planck satellites, revealing an unresolved dust condensation at the center of the Fourcade-Figueroa galaxy (ESO270-G017), which may correspond to a forming nucleus. We model the condensation's continuum spectrum in the spectral range from 3 to 1300 microns using the DUSTY code. The best-fit model, based on the Chi-square test, indicates that the condensation is a shell with an outer temperature of T_out ~ 12 K and an inner boundary temperature of T_i ~ 500 K. The shell's outer radius is r_o = 86.2 pc, and the inner cavity radius is r_i = 0.082 pc. The condensation produces an extinction A_V = 50 mag and its luminosity is L_c = 1.08E34 W, which would correspond to a burst of massive star formation approximately similar to the central 5 pc of R136 in the LMC and NGC3603, the ionizing cluster of a giant Carina arm HII region. The comparison with Normal, Luminous, and Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies leads us to consider this obscured nucleus as the nearest and weakest object of this category.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Glycolaldehyde, Methyl Formate, and Acetic Acid. II. Chemical Modeling of the Bimodal Abundance Pattern in NGC 6334I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-phase abundance ratios between \ce{C2H4O2} isomers methyl formate (MF), glycolaldehyde (GA), and acetic acid (AA) are typically on the order of 100:10:1 in star-forming regions. However, an unexplained divergence from this neat relationship was recently observed towards a collection of sources in the massive protocluster NGC 6334I; some sources exhibited extreme MF:GA ratios, producing a bimodal behavior between different sources, while the MF:AA ratio remained stable. Here, we use a three-phase gas-grain hot-core chemical model to study the effects of a large parameter space on the simulated \ce{C2H4O2} abundances. A combination of high gas densities and long timescales during ice-mantle desorption ($\sim$125--160~K) appears to be the physical cause of the high MF:GA ratios. The main chemical mechanism for GA destruction occurring under these conditions is the rapid adsorption and reaction of atomic H with GA on the ice surfaces before it has time to desorb. The different binding energies of MF and GA on water ice are crucial to the selectivity of the surface destruction mechanism; individual MF molecules rapidly escape the surface when exposed by water loss, while GA lingers and is destroyed by H. Moderately elevated cosmic-ray ionization rates can increase absolute levels of COM production in the ices and increase the MF:GA ratio, but extreme values are destructive for gas-phase COMs. We speculate that the high densities required for extreme MF:GA ratios could be evidence of COM emission dominated by COMs desorbing within a circumstellar disk.</description>

      <title>The causal effect of cosmic filaments on dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The way in which the large-scale cosmic environment affects galactic properties is not yet understood. Dark matter halos, which embed galaxies, initially evolve following linear theory. Their subsequent evolution is driven by non-linear structure formation in the halo region and in its outer environment. In this work, we present the first study where we explicitly control the linear part of the evolution of the halo, thus revealing the role of non-linear effects on halo formation. We focus specifically on the effect of proximity to a large cosmological filament. We employ the splicing method to keep fixed the initial density, velocity, and potential fields where a halo will form while changing its outer environment, from an isolated state to one where the halo is near a large filament. In the regime of Milky Way-mass halos, we find that mass and virial radius of such halos are not affected by even drastic changes of environment, whereas halo spin and shape orientation with respect to a massive filament is largely impacted, with fluctuations of up to 80 % around the mean value. Our results suggest that halo orientation and shape cannot be predicted accurately from a local analysis in the initial conditions alone. This has direct consequences on the modeling of intrinsic alignment for cosmic shear surveys, like Euclid. Our results highlight that non-linear couplings to the large-scale environment may have an amplitude comparable to linear effects, and should thus be treated explicitly in analytical models of dark matter halo formation.</description>

      <title>Stars or gas? Constraining the hardening processes of massive black-hole binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive black-hole binaries will be the loudest sources detectable by LISA. These systems are predicted to form during the hierarchical assembly of cosmic structures and coalesce by interacting with the surrounding environment. The hardening phase of their orbit is driven by either stars or gas and encodes distinctive features into the binary black holes that can potentially be reconstructed with gravitational-wave observations. We present a Bayesian framework to assess the likelihood of massive mergers being hardened by either gaseous or stellar interactions. We use state-of-the-art astrophysical models tracking the cosmological evolution of massive black-hole binaries and construct a large number of simulated catalogs of sources detectable by LISA. From these, we select a representative catalog and run both parameter estimation assuming a realistic LISA response as well model comparison capturing selection effects. Our results suggest that, at least within the context of the adopted models, future LISA observations can confidently constrain whether stars or gas are responsible for the binary hardening. We stress that accurate astrophysical modeling of the black-hole spins and the inclusion of subdominant emission modes in the adopted signal might be crucial to avoid systematic biases.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of Microlensed Images of a Binary-Lens Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve the multiple images of the binary-lens microlensing event ASASSN-22av using the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The light curves show weak binary perturbations, complicating the analysis, but the joint modeling with the VLTI data breaks several degeneracies, arriving at a strongly favored solution. Thanks to precise measurements of angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.726 +/- 0.002 mas and microlens parallax, we determine that the lens system consists of two M dwarfs with masses of M_1 = 0.261 +/- 0.009 M_sun and M_2 = 0.252 +/- 0.017 M_sun, a projected separation of r_\perp = 7.42 +/- 0.33 AU and a distance of D_L = 2.31 +/- 0.09 kpc. The successful VLTI observations of ASASSN-22av open up a new path for studying intermediate-separation (i.e., a few AUs) stellar-mass binaries, including those containing dark compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>The relative constraining power of the high-$z$ 21-cm dipole and monopole signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm background is a promising probe of early star formation and black hole activity. While a slew of experiments on the ground seek to detect the 21-cm monopole and spatial fluctuations on large $\sim 10$ arcminute scales, little work has been done on the prospects for detecting the 21-cm dipole signal or its utility as a probe of early galaxies. Though an intrinsically weak signal relative to the monopole, its direction is known well from the cosmic microwave background and wide-field surveys, plus as a relative measurement the dipole could help relax instrumental requirements. In order to understand the constraining power of the dipole, in this work we perform parameter inference on mock datasets that include the dipole, monopole, or both signals. We find that while the monopole does provide the best constraints for a given integration time, constraints from a dipole measurement are competitive, and can in principle constrain the cosmic star formation rate density and efficiency of X-ray photon production in early $z \sim 15$ galaxies to better than a factor of $\sim 2$. This result holds for most of the available prior volume, which is set by constraints on galaxy luminosity functions, the reionization history, and upper limits from 21-cm power spectrum experiments. We also find that predictions for the monopole from a dipole measurement are robust to different choices of signal model. As a result, the 21-cm dipole signal is a valuable target for future observations and offers a robust cross-check on monopole measurements.</description>

      <title>Running with the Bulls: The frequency of star-disc encounters in the Taurus star forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and planets form in regions of enhanced stellar density, subjecting protoplanetary discs to gravitational perturbations from neighbouring stars. Observations in the Taurus star-forming have uncovered evidence of at least three recent, star-disc encounters that have truncated discs (HV/DO Tau, RW Aurigae, UX Tau), raising questions about the frequency of such events. We aim to assess the probability of observing truncating star-disc encounters in Taurus. We generate a physically motivated dynamical model including binaries and spatial-kinematic substructure to follow the historical dynamical evolution and stellar encounters in the Taurus star forming region. We track the star-disc encounters and outer disc radius evolution over the lifetime of Taurus. A quarter of discs are truncated below 30 au by dynamical encounters, but this truncation mostly occurs in binaries over the course of a few orbital periods, on a time-scale $\lesssim 0.1$ Myr. Nonetheless, some truncating encounters still occur up to the present age of Taurus. Strongly truncating encounters (ejecting $\gtrsim 10$ percent of the disc mass) occur at a rate $\sim 10$ Myr$^{-1}$, sufficient to explain the encounter between HV and DO Tau $\sim 0.1$ Myr ago. If encounters that eject only $\sim 1$ percent of the disc mass are responsible for RW Aurigae and UX Tau, then they are also expected with encounter rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{enc} \sim 100{-}200$ Myr$^{-1}$. However, the observed sample of recent encounters is probably incomplete, since these examples occurred in systems that are not consistent with random drawing from the mass function. One more observed example would statistically imply additional physics, such as replenishment of the outer disc material.</description>

      <title>The Case for Super-Eddington Accretion: Connecting Weak X-ray and UV Line Emission in JWST Broad-Line AGN During the First Gyr of Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multitude of JWST studies reveal a surprising over-abundance of over-massive accreting super-massive blackholes (SMBHs) -- leading to a deepening tension between theory and observation in the first billion years of cosmic time. Across X-ray to infrared wavelengths, models built off of pre-JWST predictions fail to easily reproduce observed AGN signatures (or lack thereof), driving uncertainty around the true nature of these sources. Using a sample of JWST AGN identified via their broadened Halpha emission and covered by the deepest X-ray surveys, we find neither any measurable X-ray emission nor any detection of high-ionization emission lines frequently associated with accreting SMBHs. We propose that these sources are accreting at or beyond the Eddington limit, which reduces the need for efficient production of heavy SMBH seeds at cosmic dawn. Using a theoretical model of super-Eddington accretion, we can produce the observed relative dearth of both X-ray and ultraviolet emission, as well as the high Balmer decrements, without the need for significant dust attenuation. This work indicates that super-Eddington accretion is easily achieved through-out the early Universe, and further study is required to determine what environments are required to trigger this mode of black hole growth.</description>

      <title>The Variability of Persistent Radio Sources of Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over 700 bright millisecond-duration radio transients, known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), have been identified to date. Nevertheless, the origin of FRBs remains unknown. The two repeating FRBs (FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B) have been verified to be associated with persistent radio sources (PRSs), making them the best candidates to study the nature of FRBs. Monitoring the variability in PRSs is essential for understanding their physical nature. We conducted 22 observations of the PRSs linked to FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), to study their variability. We have observed significant flux variability for the PRSs of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, with a confidence level exceeding 99.99%, based on the observations covering the longest timescale recorded to date. The observed variability of the two PRSs exhibits no significant difference in amplitude across both short and long timescales. We found that the radio-derived star formation rates of the two FRB hosts are significantly higher than those measured by the optical $H_{\alpha}$ emissions, indicating that their host galaxies are highly obscured or most radio emissions are not from star formation processes. The observed timescale of PRS flux evolution constrained the magnetic field of FRB 20121102A with $B_\parallel\gtrsim1~{\rm mG}$ and FRB 20190520B with $B_\parallel\gtrsim0.1~{\rm mG}$.</description>

Abstract: Optical spectra of the Very Late Thermal Pulse (VLTP) object V4334 Sgr have shown a rapidly changing spectrum resulting from shocks in the outflow, which created a new bipolar nebula inside the old nebula. We see C II and C III emission lines emerging typical of a [WC 11-10]-type star. The strong increase of [O III] and [S III] emission lines indicate the possible onset of photoionisation in the new ejecta.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric modeling of interacting Type II supernovae. Application to early-time observations of SN1998S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13562</link>

Abstract: High-cadence surveys of the sky are revealing that a large fraction of red-supergiant (RSG) stars, which are progenitors of Type II-Plateau (II-P) supernovae (SNe), explode within circumstellar material (CSM). Such SNe II-P/CSM exhibit considerable diversity, with interaction signatures lasting from hours to days, potentially merging with the Type IIn subclass for which longer-duration interaction typically occurs. To tackle this growing sample of transients and to understand the pre-SN mass loss histories of RSGs, we train on the highest quality, spectropolarimetric observations of a young Type IIn SN taken to date: Those of SN1998S at ~5d after explosion. We design an approach based on a combination of radiation hydrodynamics with HERACLES and polarized radiative transfer with CMFGEN and LONG_POL. The adopted asymmetries are based on a latitudinal, depth- and time-independent, scaling of the density of 1D models of SNe II-P/CSM (e.g., model r1w6b with a `wind' mass-loss rate of 0.01Msun/yr used for SN2023ixf). For a pole-to-equator density ratio of five, we find that the polarization reaches, and then remains for days, at a maximum value of 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8% as the CSM extent is changed from 6, to 8 and 10x10^14cm. The polarization is independent of wavelength away from funnel-shaped depolarizations within emission lines. Our models implicate a significant depolarization at line cores, which we use to constrain the interstellar polarization of SN1998S. Our 2D, prolate ejecta models with moderate asymmetry match well the spectropolarimetric observations of SN1998S at 5d, supporting a polarization level of about ~2%. This study provides a framework for interpreting future spectropolarimetric observations of SNe II-P/CSM and SNe IIn and fostering a better understanding of the origin of their pre-SN mass loss.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Formation of Ultra-Massive Galaxies in the First Billion Years</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have revealed an unexpected abundance of massive galaxy candidates in the early Universe, extending further in redshift and to lower luminosity than what had previously been found by sub-millimeter surveys. These JWST candidates have been interpreted as challenging the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, but, so far, they have mostly relied only on rest-frame ultraviolet data and lacked spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts. Here we report a systematic study of 36 massive dust-obscured galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between $z_{\rm spec}=5-9$ from the JWST FRESCO survey. We find no tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model in our sample. However, three ultra-massive galaxies (log$M_{\star}/M_{\odot}$ $\gtrsim11.0$) require an exceptional fraction of 50% of baryons converted into stars -- two to three times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs. The contribution from an active nucleus is unlikely because of their extended emission. Ultra-massive galaxies account for as much as 17% of the total cosmic star formation rate density at $z\sim5-6$.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. XLIII. Measuring detailed galaxy morphologies for Euclid with machine learning</title>

Abstract: The Euclid mission is expected to image millions of galaxies with high resolution, providing an extensive dataset to study galaxy evolution. We investigate the application of deep learning to predict the detailed morphologies of galaxies in Euclid using Zoobot a convolutional neural network pretrained with 450000 galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo project. We adapted Zoobot for emulated Euclid images, generated based on Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS images, and with labels provided by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble project. We demonstrate that the trained Zoobot model successfully measures detailed morphology for emulated Euclid images. It effectively predicts whether a galaxy has features and identifies and characterises various features such as spiral arms, clumps, bars, disks, and central bulges. When compared to volunteer classifications Zoobot achieves mean vote fraction deviations of less than 12% and an accuracy above 91% for the confident volunteer classifications across most morphology types. However, the performance varies depending on the specific morphological class. For the global classes such as disk or smooth galaxies, the mean deviations are less than 10%, with only 1000 training galaxies necessary to reach this performance. For more detailed structures and complex tasks like detecting and counting spiral arms or clumps, the deviations are slightly higher, around 12% with 60000 galaxies used for training. In order to enhance the performance on complex morphologies, we anticipate that a larger pool of labelled galaxies is needed, which could be obtained using crowdsourcing. Finally, our findings imply that the model can be effectively adapted to new morphological labels. We demonstrate this adaptability by applying Zoobot to peculiar galaxies. In summary, our trained Zoobot CNN can readily predict morphological catalogues for Euclid images.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Tidal Treasures: Automated Classification of Faint Tidal Features in DECaLS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal features are a key observable prediction of the hierarchical model of galaxy formation and contain a wealth of information about the properties and history of a galaxy. Modern wide-field surveys such as LSST and Euclid will revolutionise the study of tidal features. However, the volume of data will prohibit visual inspection to identify features, thereby motivating a need to develop automated detection methods. This paper presents a visual classification of $\sim2,000$ galaxies from the DECaLS survey into different tidal feature categories: arms, streams, shells, and diffuse. We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reproduce the assigned visual classifications using these labels. Evaluated on a testing set where galaxies with tidal features were outnumbered $\sim1:10$, our network performed very well and retrieved a median $98.7\pm0.3$, $99.1\pm0.5$, $97.0\pm0.8$, and $99.4^{+0.2}_{-0.6}$ per cent of the actual instances of arm, stream, shell, and diffuse features respectively for just 20 per cent contamination. A modified version that identified galaxies with any feature against those without achieved scores of $0.981^{+0.001}_{-0.003}$, $0.834^{+0.014}_{-0.026}$, $0.974^{+0.008}_{-0.004}$, and $0.900^{+0.073}_{-0.015}$ for the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 metrics, respectively. We used a Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping analysis to highlight important regions on images for a given classification to verify the network was classifying the galaxies correctly. This is the first demonstration of using CNNs to classify tidal features into sub-categories, and it will pave the way for the identification of different categories of tidal features in the vast samples of galaxies that forthcoming wide-field surveys will deliver.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Galaxy at z &gt; 10 Explored by JWST Integral Field Spectroscopy: Hints of Rotating Disk Suggesting Weak Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of GN-z11, a luminous galaxy at $z=10.60$, carefully analyzing the public deep integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data taken with JWST NIRSpec IFU. While the observations of the IFS data originally targeted a He II clump near GN-z11, we find that CIII]$\lambda\lambda$1907,1909 emission from ionized gas at GN-z11 is bright and spatially extended significantly beyond the point-spread function (PSF). The spatially extended CIII emission of GN-z11 shows a velocity gradient, red- and blue-shifted components in the north and south directions, respectively, which cannot be explained by the variation of [CIII]$\lambda$1907/CIII]$\lambda$1909 line ratios. Assuming the velocity gradient is produced by disk rotation, we perform forward modeling with GalPak$^{3D}$, including the effects of PSF smearing and line blending, and obtain a rotation velocity of $v_{rot}=257^{+138}_{-117}$ km s$^{-1}$, a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=91^{+18}_{-32}$ km s$^{-1}$, and a ratio of $v_{rot}/\sigma_v=2.83^{+1.82}_{-1.41}$. The $v_{rot}/\sigma_v$ value would suggest a rotation-dominated disk existing at $z&gt;10$ albeit with the large uncertainties. The rotation velocity agrees with those of numerical simulations predicting a rotating disk formed in the early universe under the condition of mass compaction and weak feedback. While the velocity gradient is consistent with the rotating disk solution, we recognize that galactic outflows can also explain the velocity gradient as well as the extended morphology and the high velocity dispersion found in the outskirt. Higher S/N and resolution data are necessary to conclude the physical origin of the velocity gradient in GN-z11.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic confirmation of two luminous galaxies at $z\sim14$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first observations of JWST have revolutionized our understanding of the Universe by identifying for the first time galaxies at $z\sim13$. In addition, the discovery of many luminous galaxies at Cosmic Dawn ($z&gt;10$) has suggested that galaxies developed rapidly, in apparent tension with many standard models. However, most of these galaxies lack spectroscopic confirmation, so their distances and properties are uncertain. We present JADES JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopic confirmation of two luminous galaxies at redshifts of $z=14.32^{+0.08}_{-0.20}$ and $z=13.90\pm0.17$. The spectra reveal ultraviolet continua with prominent Lyman-$\alpha$ breaks but no detected emission lines. This discovery proves that luminous galaxies were already in place 300~million years after the Big Bang and are more common than what was expected before JWST. The most distant of the two galaxies is unexpectedly luminous and is spatially resolved with a radius of 260 parsecs. Considering also the very steep ultraviolet slope of the second galaxy, we conclude that both are dominated by stellar continuum emission, showing that the excess of luminous galaxies in the early Universe cannot be entirely explained by accretion onto black holes. Galaxy formation models will need to address the existence of such large and luminous galaxies so early in cosmic history.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Massive Star-Forming Galaxies from JWST and ALMA: Dusty, High Redshift Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the JWST NIRCam and MIRI morphological properties of 80 massive ($\log_{10}(M_\ast[M_{\odot}])$=11.2$\pm$0.1) dusty star-forming galaxies at $z$$=$2.7$^{+1.2}_{-0.7}$, identified as sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) by ALMA, that have been observed as part of the JWST PRIMER project. To compare the structure of these massive, active galaxies to more typical less actively star-forming galaxies, we define two comparison samples. The first of 850 field galaxies matched in specific star-formation rate and redshift and the second of 80 field galaxies matched in stellar mass. We identify 20$\pm$5% of the SMGs as candidate late-stage major mergers, a further 40$\pm$10% as potential minor mergers and 40$\pm$10% which have comparatively undisturbed disk-like morphologies, with no obvious massive neighbours. These rates are comparable to those for the field samples and indicate that the majority of the sub-millimetre-detected galaxies are not late-stage major mergers, but have interaction rates similar to the less-active population at $z$$\sim$2-3. We establish that SMGs have comparable near-infrared sizes to the less active populations, but exhibit lower S\'ersic indices, consistent with bulge-less disks and have more structured morphologies at 2$\mu$m relative to 4$\mu$m. We find evidence for dust reddening as the origin of the morphological differences between the populations, identifying a strong correlation between the F200W$-$F444W pixel colour and the 870$\mu$m surface brightness. We conclude that SMGs and less active galaxies at the same epochs share a common disk-like structure, but the weaker bulge components of the SMGs results in a lower dynamical stability. Consequently, instabilities triggered either secularly or by minor external perturbations result in higher levels of activity (and dust content) in SMGs compared to typical star-forming galaxies.

      <title>Deciphering spatially resolved Lyman-alpha profiles in reionization analogs: the Sunburst Arc at cosmic noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrogen Lyman-alpha (Lya) emission line, the brightest spectral feature of a photoionized gas, is considered an indirect tracer of the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons, particularly when the intergalactic medium is too opaque for direct detection. However, resonant scattering complicates interpreting the empirical properties of Lya photons, necessitating radiative transfer simulations to capture their strong coupling with underlying gas kinematics. In this study, we leverage the exceptional spatial resolution from strong gravitational lensing to investigate the connection between Lya line profiles and LyC leakage on scales of a few 100 pc in the Sunburst Arc galaxy at $z\sim2.37$. New optical echelle spectra obtained using Magellan MIKE show that both the LyC leaking and non-leaking regions exhibit a classic double-peak Lya feature with an enhanced red peak, indicating outflows at multiple locations in the galaxy. Both regions also show a central Gaussian peak atop the double peaks, indicating directly escaped Lya photons independent of LyC leakage. We introduce a machine learning-based method for emulating Lya simulations to quantify intrinsic dynamics ($\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$), neutral hydrogen column density ($N_{\mathrm{HI}}$), outflow velocity ($v_{\mathrm{exp}}$), and effective temperature ($T$) across continuous parameter spaces. By comparing the spatially and spectrally resolved Lya lines in Sunburst, we argue that the directly escaped Lya photons originate in a volume-filling, warm ionized medium spanning $\sim1$ kpc, while the LyC leakage is confined to regions of $\lesssim200$ pc. These sub-kpc variations in Lya profiles highlight the complexity of interpreting integrated properties in the presence of inhomogeneous mixtures of gas and young stars, emphasizing the need for spatially and spectrally resolved observations of distant galaxies.</description>

      <title>An Image-Based Search for Pulsar Candidates in the MeerKAT Bulge Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the results of an image-based search for pulsar candidates toward the Galactic bulge. We used mosaic images from the MeerKAT radio telescope, that were taken as part of a 173 deg**2 survey of the bulge and Galactic center of our Galaxy at L band (856-1712 MHz) in all four Stokes I, Q, U and V. The image root-mean-square noise levels of 12-17 uJy/ba represent a significant increase in sensitivity over past image-based pulsar searches. Our primary search criterion was circular polarization, but we used other criteria including linear polarization, in-band spectral index, compactness, variability and multi-wavelength counterparts to select pulsar candidates. We first demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by searching for polarized emission from known pulsars, and comparing our results with measurements from the literature. Our search resulted in a sample of 75 polarized pulsar candidates. Bright stars or young stellar objects were associated with 28 of these sources, including a small sample of highly polarized dwarf stars with pulsar-like steep spectra. Comparing the properties of this sample with the known pulsars, we identified 30 compelling candidates for pulsation follow-up, including two sources with both strong circular and linear polarization. The remaining 17 sources are either pulsars or stars, but we cannot rule out an extragalactic origin or image artifacts among the brighter, flat spectrum objects.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- IV. GTC/OSIRIS optical spectra of Gaia late-M and L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As part of our comprehensive, ongoing characterisation of the low-mass end of the main sequence in the Solar neighbourhood, we used the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias to acquire low- and mid-resolution (R$\approx$300 and R$\approx$2500) optical spectroscopy of 53 late-M and L ultracool dwarfs. Most of these objects are known but poorly investigated and lacking complete kinematics. We measured spectral indices, determined spectral types (six of which are new) and inferred effective temperature and surface gravity from BT-Settl synthetic spectra fits for all objects. We were able to measure radial velocities via line centre fitting and cross correlation for 46 objects, 29 of which lacked previous radial velocity measurements. Using these radial velocities in combination with the latest Gaia DR3 data, we also calculated Galactocentric space velocities. From their kinematics, we identified two candidates outside of the thin disc and four in young stellar kinematic groups. Two further ultracool dwarfs are apparently young field objects: 2MASSW J1246467$+$402715 (L4$\beta$), which has a potential, weak lithium absorption line, and G 196$-$3B (L3$\beta$), which was already known as young due to its well-studied primary companion.</description>
