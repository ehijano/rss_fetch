      <title>Low-energy enhancement of the magnetic dipole radiation in odd-mass lanthanides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the magnetic dipole (M1) $\gamma$-ray strength functions ($\gamma$SF) for the odd-mass lanthanides $^{143-151}$Nd and $^{147-153}$Sm using the shell-model Monte Carlo method in combination with the static-path approximation and the maximum-entropy method. In particular, we quantify the statistical uncertainties in the calculated M1 $\gamma$SFs and show that they are under control for the excitation energies relevant to the experiments despite a Monte Carlo sign problem that originates in the projection onto an odd number of neutrons. We identify a low-energy enhancement (LEE) in the M1 $\gamma$SFs of these odd-mass lanthanides, which was recently observed experimentally in some of them. We also find a scissors mode resonance (SR) in the strongly deformed isotopes. We observe that the decrease in the LEE strength with neutron number along an isotopic chain is compensated for by an increase in the SR strength in the deformed nuclei. We compare our results with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Inferring three-nucleon couplings from multi-messenger neutron-star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between nucleons in dense matter is one of the outstanding challenges of theoretical physics. Effective field theories have emerged as the dominant approach to address this problem at low energies, with many successful applications to the structure of nuclei and the properties of dense nucleonic matter. However, how far into the interior of neutron stars these interactions can describe dense matter is an open question. Here, we develop a framework that enables the inference of three-nucleon couplings in dense matter directly from astrophysical neutron-star observations. We apply this formalism to the LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave event GW170817 and the X-ray measurements from NASA's Neutron-Star Interior Composition Explorer and establish direct constraints for the couplings that govern three-nucleon interactions in chiral effective field theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate how next-generation observations of a population of neutron-star mergers can offer stringent constraints on three-nucleon couplings, potentially at a level comparable to those from laboratory data. Our work directly connects the microscopic couplings in quantum field theories to macroscopic observations of neutron stars, providing a way to test the consistency between low-energy couplings inferred from terrestrial and astrophysical data.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Effects on Hadron Yields and Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of an external magnetic field on hadron yields and fluctuations in a thermalized system within the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model using an expanded Thermal-FIST package. The magnetic field sizably enhances the final proton-to-pion (p/$\pi$) ratio due to $\Delta(1232)^{++}$ decay feeddown indicating that this ratio may serve as a potential magnetometer for freeze-out conditions. At the same time, magnetic field does not generate additional dynamical fluctuations of hadron numbers. This suggests that fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions provide limited additional information about the magnetic field beyond what is already inferred from mean multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Vector interaction bounds in NJL-like models from LQCD estimated curvature of the chiral crossover line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain improved bounds on both the flavor-independent and -dependent vector interactions in a $2+1$-flavor Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model using the latest precise LQCD results of the curvature coefficients of the chiral crossover line. We find that these lattice estimated curvature coefficients allow for both attractive and repulsive types of interactions in both the cases. With this constrained ranges of vector interactions, we further predict the behavior of the second $(\kappa_2^B)$ and fourth $(\kappa_4^B)$ order curvature coefficients as a function of the strangeness chemical potential $(\mu_S)$. We observe that the flavor mixing effects, arising from the flavor-independent vector interaction as well as from the 't Hooft interaction, play an important role in $k_2^B$. We propose that the mixing effects due to the vector interaction can be separated from those arising from the 't Hooft interaction by analyzing the behavior of $k_2^B$ as a function of $\mu_S$. Finally, we locate the critical endpoint in the $T-\mu_B$ plane using the model-estimated ranges of vector interactions and find the model's predictions to be consistent with the latest LQCD bounds.</description>

      <title>The comparison of the state-of-the-art nucleon-nucleon potentials from phase shift to nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) potential is the residual interaction of the strong interaction in the low-energy region and is also the fundamental input to the study of atomic nuclei. Based on the non-perturbative properties of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD), $NN$ potential is not yet directly accessible from QCD theory. Therefore, various models of $NN$ interactions have been constructed based on Yukawa's meson exchange pictures since the 1930s, including one-boson-exchange models, coordinate operator models and chiral effective field models. Analysis of extensive $NN$ scattering data has shown that the two-body nuclear force exhibits a short-range repulsion and intermediate-range attraction, and decays rapidly with increasing distance. A series of charge-dependent high-precision $NN$ interactions have been further developed in the past thirty years, such as the AV18 potential, CD-Bonn potential, pvCD-Bonn potentials, and the chiral effective nuclear potentials with momentum expansion up to the fifth order. In this work, the phase shifts at different channels, the cross sections, the entanglement entropy in spin space, and the equations of state of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter from these high-precision $NN$ interactions are calculated and systematically compared. It can be found that they have significant differences in the cases with high angular momentum, high laboratory energy, and high-density regions.</description>

      <title>Mirror energy difference in $sd$-shell nuclei using microscopic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we developed and tested various isospin symmetry-breaking (ISB) versions of the microscopic DJ16A interaction. Starting with the isospin symmetric DJ16A interaction, we introduced two different Coulomb interactions-Coulomb-CD and Coulomb-w/SRC-along with phenomenological charge symmetry breaking (CSB) and charge independence breaking (CIB) effects. We also considered CSB and CIB parts of the Argonne v18 (AV18) interaction. We examined two sets of interactions for each Coulomb interaction and employed these interactions to calculate $b$- and $c$-parameters of the isobaric multiplet mass equation for $|T_z| = 1/2$ and $|T_z| = 1$ nuclei across the $sd$-shell. Our results indicate that the DJ16A$^\dagger$+CD interaction provides the most accurate $b$-parameter predictions up to $A = 33$ mirror pairs. Additionally, we explored mirror energy differences (MEDs) in low-energy spectra around $A = 20$ and demonstrated that large MEDs are primarily associated with high occupancies of the $1s_{1/2}$ orbital. Furthermore, $E2$ transition strengths were calculated using all four DJ16A-based ISB interactions agreed with the experimental data, with minimal ISB effects observed on these transitions. Overall, the DJ16A$^\dagger$+CD interaction serves as a complementary set to the newly developed USD-family interactions, USDC, and USDCm and can be further tested for other mirror nuclei across the $sd$-shell to study nuclear structure properties and ISB effects in nuclear $\beta$-decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio computations of atomic nuclei, based on Hamiltonians from effective field theories of quantum chromodynamics, are now routinely used to predict and describe properties of medium heavy nuclei, and even the heavy nucleus $^{208}$Pb has been reached. These lecture notes describe what are the central ideas and concepts behind the Hamiltonians and some of the methods that have enabled this progress.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy of a color flux tube in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a novel flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), defined as the excess entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum of a region of color flux stretching between a heavy quark-anti-quark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory. We show that FTE$^2$ can be expressed in terms of correlators of Polyakov loops, is manifestly gauge-invariant, and therefore free of the ambiguities in computations of the entanglement entropy in gauge theories related to the choice of the center algebra. Employing the replica trick, we compute FTE$^2$ for $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in (2+1)D and demonstrate that it is finite in the continuum limit. We explore the properties of FTE$^2$ for a half-slab geometry, which allows us to vary the width and location of the slab, and the extent to which the slab cross-cuts the color flux tube. Following the intuition provided by computations of FTE$^2$ in (1+1)D, and in a thin string model, we examine the extent to which our FTE$^2$ results can be interpreted as the sum of an internal color entropy and a vibrational entropy corresponding to the transverse excitations of the string.</description>

      <title>Accessing universal relations of binary neutron star waveforms in massive scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the quasi-universal relations connecting tidal deformability with gravitational waveform characteristics and/or properties of individual neutron stars that were proposed in the literature within general relativity would be influenced in the massive Damour-Esposito-Farese-type scalar-tensor gravity. For this purpose, we systematically perform numerical relativity simulations of ~120 binary neutron star mergers with varying scalar coupling constants. Although only three neutron-star equations of state are adopted, a clear breach of universality can be observed in the data sets. In addition to presenting difficulties in constructing quasi-universal relations in alternative gravity theories, we also briefly compare the impacts of non-general-relativity physics on the waveform features and those due to the first order or cross-over quantum chromodynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Probing fermionic asymmetric dark matter cores using global neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is possible for asymmetric dark matter (ADM) to accumulate in neutron star interiors and affect their global properties. Considering the effects of this accumulation, neutron star mass-radius measurements can deliver new insights into the cold dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we employ Bayesian parameter estimation using real and synthetic neutron star mass-radius data to infer constraints on the combined baryonic matter and fermionic ADM EoS, where the fermionic ADM forms a core in the neutron star interior. Using currently available mass-radius data, we find that the lower bound of the ratio between ADM effective self-repulsion strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi$) and particle mass ($m_\chi$) can be constrained at the 68% (95%) credible level to $10^{-6.59}$ ($10^{-7.36}$). We also find that, if neutron star mass-radius measurement uncertainties are reduced to the 2% level, the constraints on lower bound on the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ can be improved to $10^{-6.5}$ and $10^{-7.29}$ at the 68% and 95% credible levels, respectively. However, all other combinations, of $m_\chi$, $g_\chi$, and the ADM mass-fraction, $F_\chi$, (i.e., the ratio of the gravitational ADM mass to the gravitational mass of the neutron star) are unconstrained. Furthermore, in the pressure-energy density and mass-radius planes, the inferences which include the possibility of fermionic ADM cores are nearly identical with the inferences that neglect fermionic ADM for $F_\chi \leq 1.7\%$ and neutron star mass-radius uncertainties $\geq 2\%$. Therefore, we find that neutron star mass-radius measurements can constrain ADM in some scenarios and that the presence of ADM in neutron star cores is as equally consistent with current data as the absence of ADM.</description>

      <title>Unlocking higher-order moments of parton distribution functions from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate moments of parton distribution functions of any order with lattice QCD computations. This method leverages the gradient flow for fermion and gauge fields. The flowed matrix elements of twist-2 operators renormalize multiplicatively, and the matching with physical matrix elements is achieved through the use of continuum symmetries. We derive the matching coefficients at one-loop in perturbation theory for moments of any order in the flavor non-singlet case and provide specific examples of operators suitable for lattice QCD computations. The multiplicative renormalization and matching are independent of the choice of Lorentz indices, allowing the use of temporal indices for twist-2 operators of any dimension. This approach should then also significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in the computation of moments.</description>

Abstract: Precise mass measurements of the $^{108, 110, 112, 114, 116}$Rh ground and isomeric states were performed using the Canadian Penning Trap at Argonne National Laboratory, showing a good agreement with recent JYFLTRAP measurements. A new possible isomeric state of $^{114}$Rh was also observed. These isotopes are part of the longest odd-odd chain of identical spin-parity assignment, of 1$^+$, spanning $^{104-118}$Rh, despite being in a region of deformation. Theoretical calculations were performed to explain this phenomenon. In addition, multiquasiparticle blocking calculations were conducted to study the configuration of low-lying states in the odd-odd Rh nuclei and elucidate the observed anomalous isomeric yield ratio of $^{114}$Rh.</description>

      <title>Low-$Q^{2}$ nucleon structure from an infrared-safe evolution scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-$Q^2$ nucleon structure is given with a simple nonperturbative input of three valence quarks and an all-order infrared-safe evolution scheme, showing some consistences with the experimental data. The resonance peaks in the experimental data of $F_2$ structure function are found to be modulated by the valence quark distributions. With little sea quark distribution at low $Q^2$ the valence-quark bump is clearly shown in the structure function. The three valence quark distributions at the hadronic scale is found to be the dominant origin of the PDFs at the hard scales. The high-twist corrections are needed to explain the sizeable discrepancy between the theory and the experimental measurements at low $Q^2$. The infrared-safe evolution scheme is a powerful tool for connecting the nucleon structures in the nonperturbative and perturbative regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution to the SQM2024 conference covers the molecular hypothesis for the internal structure of some open and hidden charm states. The use of effective theories that incorporate heavy-quark spin symmetry, combined with unitarization techniques, has provided strong evidences supporting this interpretation. In the heavy-light sector, we discuss the double pole structure of the $D_0^*(2300)$ and the generation of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$. In the hidden charm sector, we focus on the exotic $X(3872)$ and its heavy-quark partner, the $X(4014)$. Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of femtoscopic measurements in $p+p$ collisions to establish the nature of these states, as well as the potential role of temperature to discern their internal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a system of bosons in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. In the limit of strong attractive interactions, the bosons make a droplet insensitive to external confinement. For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs abruptly at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the abrupt change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite range effects wash out the point of transition.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole polarizability of $^{58}$Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric dipole strength distribution in $^{58}$Ni between 6 and 20 MeV has been determined from proton inelastic scattering experiments at very forward angles at RCNP, Osaka. The experimental data are rather well reproduced by quasiparticle random-phase approximation calculations including vibration coupling, despite a mild dependence on the adopted Skyrme interaction. They allow an estimate of the experimentally inaccessible high-energy contribution above 20 MeV, leading to an electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_\mathrm{D}(^{58}{\rm Ni}) = 3.48(31)$ fm$^3$. This serves as a test case for recent extensions of coupled-cluster calculations with chiral effective field theory interactions to nuclei with two nucleons on top of a closed-shell system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Closures for Neutrino Moment Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computationally efficient method for calculating the transport of neutrino flavor in simulations is to use angular moments of the neutrino one-body reduced density matrix, i.e., `quantum moments'. As with any moment-based radiation transport method, a closure is needed if the infinite tower of moment evolution equations is truncated. We derive a general parameterization of a quantum closure and the limits the parameters must satisfy in order for the closure to be physical. We then derive from multi-angle calculations the evolution of the closure parameters in two test cases which we then progressively insert into a moment evolution code and show how the parameters affect the moment results until the full multi-angle results are reproduced. This parameterization paves the way to setting prescriptions for genuine quantum closures adapted to neutrino transport in a range of situations.</description>

      <title>Recent $J/\psi$ measurements at the PHENIX experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium is an ideal probe to explore the properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Unlike Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements, quarkonium production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has different production mechanisms, can access different kinematic phase space and may experience different medium densities/temperatures. The PHENIX experiment has collected a large $J/\psi \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ data set within its unique pseudorapidity region of $1.2&lt;|\eta|&lt;2.2$ in $p+p$, $p+A$ and $A+A$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV from 2014 to 2016. Latest results of normalized charged particle multiplicity dependent normalized forward $J/\psi$ yields and normalized forward $\psi(2S)$ to $J/\psi$ ratio in 200 GeV $p+p$ collisions as well as forward $J/\psi$ azimuthal anisotropy in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will be shown. Comparison with other RHIC and LHC measurements and latest theoretical calculations will be discussed. These PHENIX results provide their unique contributions in improving the understanding of the multi-parton interaction contribution to charmonium production and the recombination/coalescence contribution to charmonium formation within Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) at RHIC energies.</description>

      <title>Precision Thermodynamics of the Fermi polaron at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi polaron problem, which describes a mobile impurity that interacts with a spin-polarized Fermi sea, is a paradigmatic system in quantum many-body physics and has been challenging to address quantitatively in its strong coupling regime. We present the first controlled thermodynamic calculations for the Fermi polaron at strong coupling using finite-temperature auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) methods in the framework of the canonical ensemble. Modeled as a spin-imbalanced system, the Fermi polaron has a Monte Carlo sign problem, but we show that it is moderate over a wide range of temperatures and coupling strengths beyond the unitary limit of the BCS-BEC crossover. We calculate the contact, a quantity which measures the strength of the short-range correlations, as a function of temperature at unitarity and as a function of the coupling strength at fixed temperature and find good agreement with a variational approach based on one particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We compare our results for the contact with recent experiments and find good agreement at unitarity (within error bars) but discrepancies away from unitarity on the BEC side of the crossover. We also calculate the thermal energy gap at unitarity as a function of temperature.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the sign of nuclear deformations: Determination of prolate or oblate shape via low-energy $\alpha$ inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Understanding nuclear shape is a crucial problem in nuclear physics. In particular, determining the sign of quadrupole deformation, i.e., whether prolate or oblate, remains a challenging problem. Purpose: Our aim is to propose a method for determining the sign of quadrupole deformation using $\alpha$ inelastic scattering data and to demonstrate its effectiveness. Method: Our approach is the standard coupled-channel method based on the macroscopic model. We utilize the nuclear reorientation effect, a phenomenon associated with the self coupling of excited states, as a probe sensitive to the sign of deformation. Results: We first provide an overview of how the reorientation effect influences inelastic scattering cross sections, and numerically confirm its validity in realistic cases. We then demonstrate that the sign of deformation can be uniquely determined from inelastic scattering cross section data. Conclusion: Our technique offers a systematic approach for determining the sign of deformation in both stable and unstable nuclei. The broad applicability of $\alpha$ inelastic scattering will make it a valuable tool to study shape of nuclei, especially unstable nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a study of the low-lying states of deformed $^{21}$Ne within the framework of quantum-number projected generator coordinate method (PGCM), starting from a chiral two-nucleon-plus-three-nucleon (NN+3N) interaction. The wave functions of states are constructed as a linear combination of a set of axially-deformed Hartree-Fock-Bogliubov (HFB) wave functions with different quadrupole deformations. These HFB wave functions are projected onto different angular momenta and the correct neutron and proton numbers for $^{21}$Ne. The results of calculations based on the effective Hamiltonians derived by normal-ordering the 3N interaction with respect to three different reference states, including the quantum-number projected HFB wave functions for $^{20}$Ne, $^{22}$Ne, and an ensemble of them with equal weights, are compared. This study serves as a key step towards ab initio calculations of odd-mass deformed nuclei with the in-medium GCM.</description>

      <title>A study of nuclear structure of light nuclei at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the substructure of atomic nuclei, particularly the clustering of nucleons inside them, is essential for comprehending nuclear dynamics. Various cluster configurations can emerge depending on excitation energy, the number and types of core clusters, and the presence of excess neutrons. Despite the prevalence of tightly bound cluster formations in low-lying states, understanding the correlation between clusters and their formation mechanisms remains incomplete. This exploring study investigates nuclear clustering at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) using simulations based on the modified BeAGLE model. By simulating collisions involving $e$+$^{9}$Be, $e$+$^{12}$C, and $e$+$^{16}$O nuclei, we find that the average energy of particles $\langle E \rangle$ and the system size ratios of particles at forward rapidity exhibit sensitivity to alpha clustering and its various configurations. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of nuclear clustering and its implications for future studies at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Coupled-Cluster Calculations of Infinite Nuclear Matter in the Complete Basis Limit Using Bayesian Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite nuclear matter provides valuable insights into the behavior of nuclear systems and aids our understanding of atomic nuclei and large-scale stellar objects such as neutron stars. However, partly due to the large basis needed to converge the system's binding energy, size-extensive methods such as coupled-cluster theory struggle with long computational run times, even using the nation's largest high-performance computing facilities. This research introduces a novel approach to the problem. We propose using a machine learning method to predict the coupled-cluster energies of infinite matter systems in the complete basis limit, leveraging only data collected using smaller basis sets. This method promises to deliver high-accuracy results with significantly reduced run times. The sequential regression extrapolation (SRE) algorithm, based on Gaussian processes, was created to perform these extrapolations. By combining Bayesian machine learning with a unique method of formatting the training data, we can create a powerful extrapolator that can make accurate predictions given very little data. The SRE algorithm successfully predicted the CCD(T) energies for pure neutron matter across six densities near nuclear saturation density, with an average error of 0.0083 MeV/N. The algorithm achieved an average error of 0.038 MeV/A for symmetric nuclear matter. These predictions were made with a time savings of 83.8 node hours for pure neutron matter and 284 node hours for symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, the symmetry energy at these six densities was predicted with an average error of 0.031 MeV/A and a total time savings of 368 node hours compared to the traditional converged coupled-cluster calculations performed without the SRE algorithm.</description>

      <title>A variational study of two-nucleon systems with lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.10835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy spectrum and scattering of two-nucleon systems are studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics using a variational approach. A wide range of interpolating operators are used: dibaryon operators built from products of plane-wave nucleons, hexaquark operators built from six localized quarks, and quasi-local operators inspired by two-nucleon bound-state wavefunctions in low-energy effective theories. Sparsening techniques are used to compute the timeslice-to-all quark propagators required to form correlation-function matrices using products of these operators. Projection of these matrices onto irreducible representations of the cubic group, including spin-orbit coupling, is detailed. Variational methods are applied to constrain the low-energy spectra of two-nucleon systems in a single finite volume with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 806 MeV. Results for S- and D-wave phase shifts in the isospin singlet and triplet channels are obtained under the assumption that partial-wave mixing is negligible. Tests of interpolating-operator dependence are used to investigate the reliability of the energy spectra obtained and highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of variational methods. These studies and comparisons to previous studies using the same gauge-field ensemble demonstrate that interpolating-operator dependence can lead to significant effects on the two-nucleon energy spectra obtained using both variational and non-variational methods, including missing energy levels and other discrepancies. While this study is inconclusive regarding the presence of two-nucleon bound states at this quark mass, it provides robust upper bounds on two-nucleon energy levels that can be improved in future calculations using additional interpolating operators and is therefore a step toward reliable nuclear spectroscopy from the underlying Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of nuclear properties in the vicinity of $^{100}$Sn, suggested to be the heaviest doubly magic nucleus with equal numbers of protons (Z=50) and neutrons (N=50), has been a long-standing challenge for experimental and theoretical nuclear physics. Contradictory experimental evidence exists on the role of nuclear collectivity in this region of the nuclear chart. Using precision laser spectroscopy, we measured the ground-state electromagnetic moments of indium (Z=49) isotopes approaching the N=50 neutron number down to 101In, and nuclear charge radii of 101-131In spanning almost the complete range between the two major neutron closed-shells at N=50 and N=82. Our results for both nuclear charge radii and quadrupole moments reveal striking parabolic trends as a function of the neutron number, with a clear reduction toward these two neutron closed-shells, thus supporting a doubly magic character of $^{100}$Sn. Two complementary nuclear many-body frameworks, density functional theory and ab initio methods, elucidate our findings. A detailed comparison with our experimental results exposes deficiencies of nuclear models, establishing a benchmark for future theoretical developments.</description>

Abstract: The low-energy finite-volume spectrum of the two-nucleon system at a quark mass corresponding to a pion mass of $m_\pi \approx 806$ MeV is studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) using variational methods. The interpolating-operator sets used in [Phys.Rev.D 107 (2023) 9, 094508] are extended by including a complete basis of local hexaquark operators, as well as plane-wave dibaryon operators built from products of both positive- and negative-parity nucleon operators. Results are presented for the isosinglet and isotriplet two-nucleon channels. In both channels, noticably weaker variational bounds on the lowest few energy eigenvalues are obtained from operator sets which contain only hexaquark operators or operators constructed from the product of two negative-parity nucleons, while other operator sets produce low-energy variational bounds which are consistent within statistical uncertainties. The consequences of these studies for the LQCD understanding of the two-nucleon spectrum are investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In present work, we perform a coupled-channel analysis of $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ systems with the one-boson-exchange potentials. We first study the $I(J^{PC})=1(1^{+-})$ $B\bar{B}^{*}/B^{*}\bar{B}^{*}$ system to describe the $Z_{b}(10610)$ and $Z_{b}(10650)$ particles as molecular states and determine the reasonable range of cutoff parameter $\Lambda$. Then, other $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ combinations with different quantum numbers are systematically investigated. Some bound states and resonances appear in the isoscalar systems, while only several shallow bound states exist for isovector systems. Far away from the excited conventional $P-$wave bottomium, these predicted states can be easily identified as exotic particles both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, the $\eta_b(nS)/\Upsilon(nS)$ plus light mesons are the excellent final states to search for the bound states, while the $B\bar B^*+h.c.$ and $B^* \bar B^*$ channels are suitable for the resonances. We highly recommend that the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations can hunt for these bottomonium-like states in future.</description>

      <title>Analytical insights into the interplay of momentum, multiplicity and the speed of sound in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions to study the relation between the speed of sound of the produced plasma and the final particles' energy and multiplicity. We discuss how the particles' multiplicity $N_{\textrm{tot}}$ and average energy $E_{\textrm{tot}}/N_{\textrm{tot}}$ is related to the speed of sound $c_s$ by $c_s^2=d \ln (E_{\textrm{tot}}/N_{\textrm{tot}})/d\ln N_{\textrm{tot}}$ if the fluid is inviscid, its speed of sound is constant and all final particles can be measured. We show that finite rapidity cuts on the particles' multiplicity $N$ and energy $E$ introduce corrections between $c_s^2$ and $d \ln (E/N)/d\ln N$ that depend on the system's lifetime. We study analytically these deviations with the Gubser hydrodynamic solution, finding that, for ultrarelativistic bosons, they scale as the ratio of the freezeout temperature $T_{\mathrm{FO}}$ over the maximum initial temperature of the fluid $T_{0}$; the non-thermodynamic aspect of these corrections is highlighted through their dependence on the system's initial conditions.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications</title>

Abstract: PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of &lt;~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of &gt;~330 pc. The low implied luminosity (~7.6x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effect on hadron yield ratios and fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of an external magnetic field on hadron yields and fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas by performing calculations within an updated version of the open-source Thermal-FIST package. The presence of the magnetic field has a sizable influence on certain hadron yield ratios. Most notably, it leads to enhanced $p/\pi$ and suppressed $n/p$ ratios, which may serve as a magnetometer in heavy-ion collisions. By attributing the centrality dependence of the $p/\pi$ ratio in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02~TeV measured by the ALICE Collaboration entirely to the magnetic field, its maximal strength at freeze-out is estimated to be $eB \simeq 0.12$~GeV$^2 \simeq 6.3 m_\pi^2$ in peripheral collisions. The magnetic field also enhances various conserved charge susceptibilities, which is qualitatively consistent with recent lattice QCD data and is driven in the HRG model by the increase of hadron densities. However, the variances of hadrons do not show any enhancement when normalized by the means, therefore, measurements of second-order fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions appear to offer limited additional information about the magnetic field relative to mean multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal chiral contributions to generalized parton distributions of the proton at nonzero skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop contributions to spin-averaged generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in the proton from pseudoscalar mesons with intermediate octet and decuplet baryon states at nonzero skewness. Our framework is based on nonlocal covariant chiral effective theory, with ultraviolet divergences regularized by introducing a relativistic regulator derived consistently from the nonlocal Lagrangian. Using the splitting functions calculated from the nonlocal Lagrangian, we find the nonzero skewness GPDs from meson loops by convoluting with the phenomenological pion GPD and the generalized distribution amplitude, and verify that these satisfy the correct polynomiality properties. We also compute the lowest two moments of GPDs to quantify the meson loop effects on the Dirac, Pauli and gravitational form factors of the proton.</description>
