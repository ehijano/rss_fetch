      <title>Coherent High-Harmonic Generation with Laser-Plasma Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active energy compression scheme is presently being investigated for future laser-plasma accelerators. This method enables generating laser-plasma accelerator electron beams with a small, $\sim 10^{-5}$, relative slice energy spread. When modulated by a laser pulse, such beams can produce coherent radiation at very high, $\sim 100$-th harmonics of the modulation laser wavelength, which are hard to access by conventional techniques. The scheme has a potential of providing additional capabilities for future plasma-based facilities by generating stable, tunable, narrow-band radiation.</description>

      <title>A fully plasma based electron injector for a linear collider or XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate through high-fidelity particle-in-cell simulations a simple approach for efficiently generating 20+ GeV electron beams with the necessary charge, energy spread, and emittance for use as the injector for an electron arm of a future linear collider or a next generation XFEL. The self-focusing of an unmatched, relatively low quality, drive beam results in self-injection by elongating the wakefield excited in the nonlinear blowout regime. Over pump depletion distances, the drive beam dynamics and self-loading from the injected beam leads to extremely high quality and high energy output beams. For plasma densities of $10^{18} \ \text{cm}^{-3}$, PIC simulation results indicate that self-injected beams with $0.52 \ \text{nC}$ of charge can be accelerated to $\sim 20$ GeV energies with projected energy spreads, $\lesssim 1\%$ within the beam core, slice normalized emittances as low as $110 \ \text{nm}$, a peak normalized brightness $\gtrsim 10^{19} \ \text{A}/\text{m}^2/\text{rad}^2$, and energy transfer efficiencies $\gtrsim 54\%$.</description>

      <title>Efficient backward x-ray emission in a finite-length plasma irradiated by a laser pulse of ps duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments employing ps-long, kilojoule laser pulses, we examined x-ray emission in a finite-length underdense plasma irradiated by such a pulse using two dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We found that, in addition to the expected forward emission, the plasma also efficiently emits in the backward direction. Our simulations reveal that the backward emission occurs when the laser exits the plasma. The longitudinal plasma electric field generated by the laser at the density down-ramp turns around some of the laser-accelerated electrons and re-accelerates them in the backward direction. As the electrons collide with the laser, they emit hard x-rays. The energy conversion efficiency is comparable to that for the forward emission, but the effective source size is smaller. We show that the ps laser duration is required for achieving a spatial overlap between the laser and the backward energetic electrons. At peak laser intensity of $1.4\times 10^{20}~\rm{W/cm^2}$, backward emitted photons (energies above 100~keV and $10^{\circ}$ divergence angle) account for $2 \times 10^{-5}$ of the incident laser energy. This conversion efficiency is three times higher than that for similarly selected forward emitted photons. The source size of the backward photons ($5~\rm{\mu m}$) is three times smaller than the source size of the forward photons.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional maximum-entropy phase space tomography using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle accelerators generate charged particle beams with tailored distributions in six-dimensional (6D) position-momentum space (phase space). Knowledge of the phase space distribution enables model-based beam optimization and control. In the absence of direct measurements, the distribution must be tomographically reconstructed from its projections. In this paper, we highlight that such problems can be severely underdetermined and that entropy maximization is the most conservative solution strategy. We leverage normalizing flows -- invertible generative models -- to extend maximum-entropy tomography to 6D phase space and perform numerical experiments to validate the model performance. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that flow-based entropy estimates are consistent with 2D maximum-entropy solutions and that normalizing flows can fit complex 6D phase space distributions to large measurement sets in reasonable time.</description>
