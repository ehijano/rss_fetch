      <title>On diamond partial order, one-sided star partial orders, and 1MP-inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides some new characterizations of the diamond partial order for rectangular matrices by using properties of inner inverses, minus order, and SVD decompositions. In addition, the recently introduced 1MP generalized inverse and its dual are used to characterize the diamond partial order as a ${\cal G}$-based one. Finally, the one-sided star partial order is investigated by using 1MP- and MP1-inverses.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms between injective modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{M})$ is an injective structure of $R$-Mod such that the class $\mathcal{F}$ is closed for direct limits, then two modules in $\mathcal{M}$ are isomorphic if there are maps in $\mathcal{F}$ from each one of the modules into the other. Examples of module classes in such injective structures include (pure, coneat, and RD-) injective modules, as well as $\tau$-injective modules for a hereditary torsion theory $\tau$. Thus providing a generalization of a classical result of Bumby's and two recent ones by Mac\'{i}as-D\'{i}az.</description>

      <title>The Algebraic Kirchberg-Phillips Question for Leavitt path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Algebraic Kirchberg-Phillips Question for Leavitt path algebras asks whether unital $K$-theory is a complete isomorphism invariant for unital, simple, purely infinite Leavitt path algebras over finite graphs. Most work on this problem has focused on determining whether (up to isomorphism) there is a unique unital, simple, Leavitt path algebra with trivial $K$-theory (often reformulated as the question of whether the Leavitt path algebras $L_2$ and $L_{2_-}$ are isomorphic). However, it is unknown whether a positive answer to this special case implies a positive answer to the Algebraic Kirchberg-Phillips Question. In this note, we pose a different question that asks whether two particular non-simple Leavitt path algebras $L_k(\mathbf{F}_*)$ and $L_k(\mathbf{F}_{**})$ are isomorphic, and we prove that a positive answer to this question implies a positive answer to the Algebraic Kirchberg-Phillips Question.</description>

      <title>Operad and cohomology of associative algebras with generalized derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An associative algebra with a generalized derivation is called an AsGDer triple. We introduce the operad that encodes AsGDer triples, and prove it is a Koszul operad. Using its Koszul dual cooperad, we introduce the homotopy version of AsGDer triples. As an application, we construct the AsGDer cohomology theory for AsGDer triples, and show that the formal deformation of an AsGDer triple is controlled by the AsGDer cohomology.</description>

      <title>Tropical Matrix Exponential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an exponential for tropical matrices and show that this series is essential for the analysis of certain kinds of stability in discrete event dynamic systems. A notion of a generalised eigenvector is introduced to discuss this kind of stability and prove it exists at most in the order of $1,p/2,p$, where $p$ is the period of the corresponding matrix. Thus characterizing the generalised eigenvectors of all powers of the matrix. Also, a sufficient condition is proved for the exponential of a matrix to be robust.</description>

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to give alternative proofs for the symmetric Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem utilizing the Magnus recursion formulae or Dynkin's non-commutative polynomial comparison method and simple universal algebraic principles.

      <title>Linear maps preserving $\ell_p$-norm parallel vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two vectors $x, y$ in a normed vector space are parallel if there is a scalar $\mu$ with $|\mu| = 1$ such that $\|x+\mu y\| = \|x\| + \|y\|$; they form a triangle equality attaining (TEA) pair if $\|x+y\| = \|x\| + \|y\|$. In this paper, we characterize linear maps on $F^n=R^n$ or $C^n$, equipped with the $\ell_p$-norm for $p \in [1, \infty]$, preserving parallel pairs or preserving TEA pairs. Indeed, any linear map will preserve parallel pairs and TEA pairs when $1&lt; p &lt;\infty$. For the $\ell_1$-norm, TEA preservers form a semigroup of matrices in which each row has at most one nonzero entries; adding rank one matrices to this semigroup will be the semigroup of parallel preserves. For the $\ell_\infty$-norm, a nonzero TEA preserver, or a parallel preserver of rank greater than one, is always a multiple of an $\ell_\infty$-norm isometry, except when $F^n = R^2$. We also have a characterization for the exceptional case. The results are extended to linear maps of the infinite dimensional spaces $\ell_1(\Lambda)$, $c_0(\Lambda)$ and $\ell_\infty(\Lambda)$.</description>

      <title>Bizonotopal Graphical Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zonotopal algebras (external, central, and internal) of an undirected graph G introduced by Postnikov-Shapiro and Holtz-Ron, are finite-dimensional commutative graded algebras whose Hilbert series contain a wealth of combinatorial information about G. In this paper, we associate to G a new family of algebras, which we call bizonotopal, because their definition involves doubling the set of edges of G. These algebras are monomial and have intricate properties related, among other things, to the combinatorics of graphical parking functions and their polytopes.
  Unlike the case of usual zonotopal algebras, the Hilbert series of bizonotopal algebras are not specializations of the Tutte polynomial of G. Still, we show that in the external and central cases these Hilbert series satisfy a modified deletion-contraction relation. In addition, we prove that the external bizonotopal algebra is a complete graph invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate injective generation for graded rings. We first examine the relation between injective generation and graded injective generation for graded rings. We then reduce the study of injective generation for graded rings to the study of injective generation for certain Morita context rings and we provide sufficient conditions for injective generation of the latter. We then provide necessary and sufficient conditions so that injectives generate for tensor rings and for trivial extension rings. We provide two proofs for the class of tensor rings, the one uses covering theory and the other uses the framework of cleft extensions of module categories. We finally prove injective generation for twisted tensor products of finite dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and dual weak left braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As generalizations of Rota--Baxter groups, Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups have been introduced by Catino, Mazzotta and Stefanelli in 2023. Based on their pioneering results, we continue to study Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and their generalizations in the present paper. Inspired by the corresponding results in Rota--Baxter groups, we firstly obtain some properties and construction methods for Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups, and then study the substructures and quotient structures of these semigroups. On the other hand, we introduce the notion of relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and explore the relationship between these semigroups and dual weak left braces, which are known to give set-theoretical solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation. More specifically, we show that every relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroup gives rise to a dual weak left brace, and conversely, every dual weak left brace can be obtained from a bijective strong relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroup. Furthermore, it turns out that there is an equivalence between the two categories of bijective strong Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and dual weak left braces. The substructures and quotient structures of Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups are also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tensor products of irreducible highest weight modules with irreducible loop modules over the affine-Virasoro algebra with aid of the ``shifting technique" established for the Virasoro algebra in [H. Chen, X. Guo, K. Zhao, Tensor product weight modules over the Virasoro algebra, J. Lond. Math. Soc. 88(2013), 829-844.]. All such tensor product modules are indecomposable modules with infinite-dimensional weight spaces. Moreover, we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for such tensor product modules to be irreducible. Therefore, we obtain a class of new irreducible weight modules over the affine-Virasoro algebra. Finally, the necessary and sufficient conditions for any two such tensor product modules to be isomorphic are also determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the families of bialgebras or Hopf algebras over fields for which the product in the corresponding category is finite-dimensional, answering a question of M. Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then bialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors are, with at most one of dimension $&gt;1$; over finite fields the necessary and sufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most finitely many of dimension $&gt;1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras as well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field extensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor preserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an error in the literature) and (b) algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree coalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The principal observation of the present paper is that an inner isotopy (i.e. a principal isotopy defined by an algebra endomorphism) is a very helpful instrument in constructing and studying interesting classes of nonassociative algebras. By using methods developed in the paper, we define a new class of commutative nonassociative algebras obtained by inner isotopy from commutative associative polynomial algebras. There is a natural bijection between isomorphism classes of our algebras and integer partitions of the algebra dimensions. Among the interesting features of the nonassociative algebras constructed are that these algebras are generic, some of examples are axial and metrized algebras. We completely describe both the set of algebra idempotents and their spectra.</description>

Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with some of the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\delta$ be a derivation in a $K$-algebra $R$ and let ${\rm Aut_{\delta}}(R)$ be the isotropy group with respect to the natural conjugation action of $\rm Aut(R)$ of $K$-automorphisms on the set $\rm Der(R)$ of $K$-derivations: that is, the subgroup of automorphisms that commute with the derivation. We explore the characterization of ${\rm Aut_{\delta}}(R)$ for quantum Weyl algebras and we prove that in the case of the Jordanian plane it is always a finite cyclic group. Furthermore, we obtain an arithmetic characterization that allows us to trivially demonstrate that these algebras are not isomorphic.</description>

Abstract: We present an efficient computational representation of central simple algebras using Brauer factor sets. Using this representation and polynomial quantum algorithms for number theoretical tasks such as factoring and $S$-unit group computation, we give a polynomial quantum algorithm for the explicit isomorphism problem over number field, which relies on a heuristic concerning the irreducibility of the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix with algebraic integer coefficients. We present another version of the algorithm which does not need any heuristic but which is only polynomial if the degree of the input algebra is bounded.</description>
