      <title>Coupled circularly polarized electromagnetic soliton states in magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between two co-propagating electromagnetic pulses in a magnetized plasma is considered, from first principles, relying on a fluid-Maxwell model. Two circularly polarized wavepackets by same group velocities are considered, characterized by opposite circular polarization, to be identified as left-hand- or right hand circularly polarized (i.e. LCP or RCP, respectively). A multiscale perturbative technique is adopted, leading to a pair of coupled nonlinear Schrodinger-type (NLS) equations for the modulated amplitudes of the respective vector potentials associated with the two pulses. Systematic analysis reveals the existence, in certain frequency bands, of three different types of vector soliton modes: an LCP-bright/RCP-bright coupled soliton pair state, an LCP bright/RCP-dark soliton pair, and an LCP-dark/RCP-bright soliton pair. The value of the magnetic field plays a critical role since it determines the type of vector solitons that may occur in certain frequency bands and, on the other hand, it affects the width of those frequency bands that are characterized by a specific type of vector soliton (type). The magnetic field (strength) thus arises as an order parameter, affecting the existence conditions of each type of solution (in the form of an envelope soliton pair). An exhaustive parametric investigation is presented in terms of frequency bands and in a wide range of magnetic field (strength) values, leading to results that may be applicable in beam-plasma interaction scenarios as well as in space plasmas and in the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>On the temporal tweezing of cavity solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of J.K.~Jang et al., Nat.~Commun.~{\bf 6}, 7370 (2015), where the authors experimentally tweeze cavity solitons in a passive loop of optical fiber, we study the amenability to tweezing of cavity solitons as the properties of a localized tweezer are varied. The system is modeled by the Lugiato-Lefever equation, a variant of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We produce an effective, localized, trapping tweezer potential by assuming a Gaussian phase-modulation of the holding beam. The potential for tweezing is then assessed as the total (temporal) displacement and speed of the tweezer are varied, and corresponding phase diagrams are presented. As the relative speed of the tweezer is increased we find two possible dynamical scenarios: successful tweezing and release of the cavity soliton. We also deploy a non-conservative variational approximation (NCVA) based on a Lagrangian description which reduces the original dissipative partial differential equation to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations for the cavity soliton parameters. We illustrate the ability of the NCVA to accurately predict the separatrix between successful and failed tweezing. This showcases the versatility of the NCVA to provide a low-dimensional description of the experimental realization of the temporal tweezing.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states: Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone modes, Floquet thermodynamics, and the time operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry-breaking in a spontaneous Floquet state, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states simultaneously breaking several symmetries, finding that Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Nevertheless, these also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. Using the Truncated Wigner method, we numerically compute its quantum fluctuations, which are theoretically predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.</description>
