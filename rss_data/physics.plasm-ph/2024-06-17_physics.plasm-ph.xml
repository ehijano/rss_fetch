      <title>Axisymmetric predictions for mitigated and vertically unstable disruptions in ITER with runaway electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two-dimensional global simulations of mitigated and vertically unstable disruptions in ITER in the presence of runaway electrons. An elongated plasma in free-boundary equilibrium is subjected to an artificial thermal quench and current-profile flattening, followed by one or more massive material injections and RE avalanche. Scenarios of major disruptions as well as upward and downward vertical displacement events are considered. Results provide important insights into the effects of runaway electron formation, post thermal quench current-profile, injection quantities and timings, and impurity flushout on the overall evolution of disruption and the plasma vertical motion thereof. Interplay between the various effects offers scope for potentially beneficial runaway electron mitigation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond pulsed barrier discharge in argon for various frequencies and theoretical analysis of 2p states density ratios for E/N determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanosecond pulsed barrier discharges in atmospheric pressure argon are simulated using spatially one- and two-dimensional fluid-Poisson models using the reaction kinetics model presented by Stankov et al. [1], which considers all ten argon 2p states (Paschen notation) separately. The very first (single) discharge and repetitive discharges with frequencies from 5kHz to 100kHz are considered and a semi-automated procedure is utilized to find appropriate 2p states for electric field determination using an intensity ratio method. The proposed method is based on a time-dependent collisional-radiative model enabling a sub-nanosecond plasma diagnostics, it links the 2p state density ratios to the reduced electric field strength E/N by quantifying the excitation rate coefficients and by computing 2p states effective lifetimes from the fluid model simulation. The semi-automated procedure identifies several candidates for determination of E/N from given temporal profiles of the 2p state densities. Different approaches for effective lifetime determination are tested and applied also to measured data. The influence of radial and axial 2p state density integration on the intensity ratio method is discussed. The above mentioned models and procedures result in a flexible theory-based methodology applicable for development of new diagnostic techniques.</description>

      <title>Generation of THz waves through interaction of the wakefield of two-color laser pulses with magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study explores radiation in THz spectrum region through the interaction of the wakefield of two-color laser pulses with magnetized plasma. The interaction of the two-color laser with plasma electrons induces transverse nonlinear current in two dimensions, resulting in generation of a wakefield and a forward wave. The investigation revealed that during the non-relativistic regime of laser-plasma interaction, interdependence exists between the electric fields of the forward wave and the wake. Conversely, in the relativistic regime, the dynamic of interaction changes, and plasma electrons are influenced not only by the electric field of the laser pulse but also by relativistic effects like Lorentz contraction, responding to both the electric and magnetic field components. This leads to generation of wake and forward wave radiations. The interplay between various laser and plasma parameters is analyzed, shedding light on the conditions leading to radiation angular distribution patterns in the forward and backward directions. The impact of spatial laser profile, a DC external magnetic field, polarization states, and plasma interaction length on the generated wake and forward wave patterns has been investigated. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the objective is to elucidate the controlled directional features of the resulting fields and radiation patterns.</description>

      <title>High-order implicit solver in conservative formulation for tokamak plasma transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient numerical scheme for solving transport equations for tokamak plasmas within an integrated modelling framework is presented. The plasma transport equations are formulated as diffusion-advection equations in two coordinates (a temporal and a spatial) featuring stiff non-linearities. The presented numerical scheme aims to minimise computational costs, which are associated with repeated calls of numerically expensive physical models in a processes of time stepping and non-linear convergence within an integrated modelling framework. The spatial discretisation is based on the 4th order accurate Interpolated Differential Operator in Conservative Formulation, the time-stepping method is the 2nd order accurate implicit Runge-Kutta scheme, and an under-relaxed Picard iteration is used for accelerating non-linear convergence. Temporal and spatial accuracies of the scheme allow for coarse grids, and the implicit time-stepping method together with the non-linear convergence approach contributes to robust and fast non-linear convergence. The spatial discretisation method enforces conservation in spatial coordinate up to the machine precision. The numerical scheme demonstrates accurate, stable and fast non-linear convergence in numerical tests using analytical stiff transport model. In particular, the 2nd order accuracy in time stepping significantly improves the overall convergence properties and the accuracy of simulating transient processes in comparison to the 1st order schemes.</description>

      <title>Parametric Modeling of Serpentine Waveguide Traveling Wave Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple and fast model for numerically calculating small-signal gain in serpentine waveguide traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) is described. In the framework of the Pierce model, we consider one-dimensional electron flow along a dispersive single-mode slow-wave structure (SWS), accounting for the space-charge effect. The analytical model accounts for the frequency-dependent phase velocity and characteristic impedance obtained using various equivalent circuit models from the literature, validated by comparison with full-wave eigenmode simulation. The model includes a relation between the modal characteristic impedance and the interaction (Pierce) impedance of the SWS, including also an extra correction factor that accounts for the variation of the electric field distribution and hence of the interaction impedance over the beam cross section. By applying boundary conditions to our generalized Pierce model, we compute both the theoretical gain of a TWT and all the complex-valued wavenumbers of the hot modes versus frequency and compare our results with numerically intensive particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations; the good agreement in the comparison demonstrates the accuracy and simplicity of our generalized model. For various examples where we vary the average electron beam (e-beam) phase velocity, average e-beam current, number of unit cells, and input radio frequency (RF) power, we demonstrate that our model is robust in the small-signal regime.</description>

      <title>Topological modes and spectral flows in inhomogeneous PT-symmetric continuous media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical Hermitian continuous media, the spectral-flow index of topological modes is linked to the bulk topology via index theorem. However, the interface between two bulks is usually non-Hermitian due to the inhomogeneities of system parameters. We show that the connection between topological modes and bulk topology still exists despite the non-Hermiticity at the interface if the system is endowed with PT symmetry. The theoretical framework developed is applied to the Hall magnetohydrodynamic model to identify a topological mode called topological Alfv\'{e}n-sound wave in magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Phase-space entropy cascade and irreversibility of stochastic heating in nearly collisionless plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nearly collisionless plasma consisting of a species of `test particles' in 1D-1V, stirred by an externally imposed stochastic electric field. The mean effect on the particle distribution function is stochastic heating. Accompanying this heating is the generation of fine-scale structure in the distribution function, which we characterize with the collisionless (Casimir) invariant $C_2 \propto \iint dx dv \, \langle f^2 \rangle$. We find that $C_2$ is transferred from large scales to small scales in both position and velocity space via a phase-space cascade enabled by both particle streaming and nonlinear interactions between particles and the stochastic electric field. We compute the steady-state fluxes and spectrum of $C_2$ in Fourier space, with $k$ and $s$ denoting spatial and velocity wavenumbers, respectively. Whereas even the linear phase mixing alone would lead to a constant flux of $C_2$ to high $s$ (towards the collisional dissipation range) at every $k$, the nonlinearity accelerates this cascade by intertwining velocity and position space so that the flux of $C_2$ is to both high $k$ and high $s$ simultaneously. Integrating over velocity (spatial) wavenumbers, the $k$-space ($s$-space) flux of $C_2$ is constant down to a dissipation length (velocity) scale that tends to zero as the collision frequency does, even though the rate of collisional dissipation remains finite. The resulting spectrum in the inertial range is a self-similar function in the $(k,s)$ plane, with power-law asymptotics at large $k$ and $s$. We argue that stochastic heating is made irreversible by this entropy cascade and that, while collisional dissipation accessed via phase mixing occurs only at small spatial scales rather than at every scale as it would in a linear system, the cascade makes phase mixing even more effective overall in the nonlinear regime than in the linear one.</description>

      <title>Long-legged Divertors and Neutral Baffling as a Solution to the Tokamak Power Exhaust Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exhausting the power from the hot fusion core to the plasma facing components is one of fusion's biggest challenges. The MAST Upgrade tokamak uniquely integrates strong containment of neutrals within the exhaust area (divertor), away from the hot fusion core, with extreme divertor shaping. This enables improving power exhaust through long-legged divertors with a high magnetic field gradient (total flux expansion). This study shows compelling MAST-U results for the improved power exhaust of long-legged, totally flux expanded, divertors, without any adverse impact to the hot fusion core, representing a significant step forward in addressing the fusion power exhaust challenge. Our comparative analysis of various divertor shapes demonstrates that even modest adjustments can significantly enhance exhaust performance while preserving core plasma performance. Through novel analysis, we attribute the reductions in particle and power loads to the expanded plasma-neutral interaction volume within long-legged divertors, in agreement with reduced models and simulation results. Strong segregation of neutrals enables the benefits of long-legged, totally flux expanded, divertors to be retrieved. Our study underscores the critical role of strategic divertor shaping in enhancing exhaust performance, stability and core-edge integration; signifying an essential advancement towards sustainable fusion energy.</description>

      <title>Progress in Electron Energy Modeling for Hypersonic Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11052v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel formulation of the electron energy relaxation terms is presented here, which is applicable to high-speed plasma flows and discharges wherein the electron temperature could be higher or lower than the gas temperature. It is demonstrated that the electron energy losses due to inelastic collisions can be expressed as a function of only two species-dependent parameters: the reduced electric field and the reduced electron mobility. This formulation is advantageous over previous ones, being simpler to implement and more accurate when experimental data of the reduced electric field and reduced mobility are available. Curve fits to empirical data of these two properties are outlined here for all important air molecular species. The approach accounts for all inelastic electron energy relaxation processes without needing individual cross-sections or rates, reducing potential errors associated with independently handling each process. Several test cases are presented to validate the proposed electron energy source terms including hypersonic plasma flows for which the electron temperature is less than the gas temperature, as well as discharges in which the electron temperature reaches values in excess of 30 eV. In all cases, the agreement with experimental data is observed to be very good to excellent, significantly surpassing prior electron energy models for high-speed flows.</description>

Abstract: We present 3D fully kinetic shearing-box simulations of pair-plasma magnetorotational turbulence with unprecedented macro-to-microscopic scale separation. While retrieving the expected fluid behavior of the plasma at large scales, we observe a steepening of turbulent spectra at kinetic scales and substantial angular-momentum transport linked with kinetic processes. For the first time, we provide a definitive demonstration of nonthermal particle acceleration in kinetic magnetorotational turbulence agnostically of initial conditions, by means of a novel strategy exploiting synchrotron cooling.</description>

      <title>The relative prevalence of wave-packets and coherent structures in the inertial and kinetic ranges of turbulence as seen by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar Orbiter (SO) mission provides the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind turbulence. We use SO observations of nine extended intervals of homogeneous turbulence to determine when turbulent magnetic field fluctuations may be characterized as: (i) wave-packets and (ii) coherent structures (CS). We perform the first systematic scale-by-scale decomposition of the magnetic field using two wavelets known to resolve wave-packets and discontinuities, the Daubechies 10 (Db10) and Haar respectively. The probability distributions (pdfs) of turbulent fluctuations on small scales exhibit stretched tails, becoming Gaussian at the outer scale of the cascade. Using quantile-quantile plots, we directly compare the wavelet fluctuations pdfs, revealing three distinct regimes of behaviour. Deep within the inertial range (IR) both decompositions give essentially the same fluctuation pdfs. Deep within the kinetic range (KR) the pdfs are distinct as the Haar wavelet fluctuations have larger variance and more extended tails. On intermediate scales, spanning the IR-KR break, the pdf is composed of two populations: a core of common functional form containing $\sim97\%$ of fluctuations, and tails which are more extended for Haar fluctuations than Db10 fluctuations. This establishes a crossover between wave-packet (core) and CS (tail) phenomenology in the IR and KR respectively. The range of scales where the pdfs are $2$-component is narrow at $0.9$ au ($4-16$ s) and broader ($0.5-8$ s) at $0.4$ au. As CS and wave-wave interactions are both candidates to mediate the turbulent cascade, these results offer new insights into the distinct physics of the IR and KR.</description>
