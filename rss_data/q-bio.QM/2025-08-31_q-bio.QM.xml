      <title>ImmunoAI: Accelerated Antibody Discovery Using Gradient-Boosted Machine Learning with Thermodynamic-Hydrodynamic Descriptors and 3D Geometric Interface Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require 10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on 117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2 variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Digital Twins in Biomedical Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics, rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges. Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification. Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods across all challenges.</description>

      <title>When Many Trees Go to War</title>

Abstract: It is known that any two trees on the same $n$ leaves can be displayed by a network with $n-2$ reticulations, and there are two trees that cannot be displayed by a network with fewer reticulations. But how many reticulations are needed to display multiple trees? For any set of $t$ trees on $n$ leaves, there is a trivial network with $(t - 1)n$ reticulations that displays them. To do better, we have to exploit common structure of the trees to embed non-trivial subtrees of different trees into the same part of the network. In this paper, we show that for $t \in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there is a set of $t$ trees with virtually no common structure that could be exploited. More precisely, we show for any $t\in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there are $t$ trees such that any network displaying them has $(t-1)n - o(n)$ reticulations. For $t \in o(\lg n)$, we obtain a slightly weaker bound. We also prove that already for $t = c\lg n$, for any constant $c &gt; 0$, there is a set of $t$ trees that cannot be displayed by a network with $o(n \lg n)$ reticulations, matching up to constant factors the known upper bound of $O(n \lg n)$ reticulations sufficient to display \emph{all} trees with $n$ leaves. These results are based on simple counting arguments and extend to unrooted networks and trees.</description>

      <title>Nucleation feedback can drive establishment and maintenance of biased microtubule polarity in neurites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microtubule cytoskeleton is comprised of dynamic, polarized filaments that facilitate transport within the cell. Polarized microtubule arrays are key to facilitating cargo transport in long cells such as neurons. Microtubules also undergo dynamic instability, where the plus and minus ends of the filaments switch between growth and shrinking phases, leading to frequent microtubule turnover. Although microtubules often completely disassemble and new filaments nucleate, microtubule arrays have been observed to both maintain their biased orientation throughout the cell lifetime and to rearrange their polarity as an adaptive response to injury. Motivated by cytoskeleton organization in neurites, we propose a spatially-explicit stochastic model of microtubule arrays and investigate how nucleation of new filaments could generate biased polarity in a simple linear domain. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model of microtubule growth dynamics, we model and parameterize two experimentally-validated nucleation mechanisms: nucleation feedback, where the direction of filament growth depends on existing microtubule content, and a checkpoint mechanism, where microtubules that nucleate in a direction opposite to the majority experience frequent catastrophe. When incorporating these validated mechanisms into the spatial model, we find that nucleation feedback is sufficient to establish biased polarity in neurites of different lengths, and that the emergence and maintenance of biased polarity is relatively stable in spite of stochastic fluctuations. This work provides a framework to study the relationship between microtubule nucleation and polarity, and could extend to give insights into mechanisms that drive the formation of polarized filament arrays in other biological settings.</description>

      <title>Numerical Uncertainty in Linear Registration: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While linear registration is a critical step in MRI preprocessing pipelines, its numerical uncertainty is understudied. Using Monte-Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) simulations, we assessed the most commonly used linear registration tools within major software packages (SPM, FSL, and ANTs) across multiple image similarity measures, two brain templates, and both healthy control (HC, n=50) and Parkinson's Disease (PD, n=50) cohorts. Our findings highlight the influence of linear registration tools and similarity measures on numerical stability. Among the evaluated tools and with default similarity measures, SPM exhibited the highest stability. FSL and ANTs showed greater and similar ranges of variability, with ANTs demonstrating particular sensitivity to numerical perturbations that occasionally led to registration failure. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between healthy and PD cohorts, suggesting that numerical stability analyses obtained with healthy subjects may generalise to clinical populations. Finally, we also demonstrated how numerical uncertainty measures may support automated quality control (QC) of linear registration results. Overall, our experimental results characterize the numerical stability of linear registration experimentally and can serve as a basis for future uncertainty analyses.</description>

      <title>An MRI Atlas of the Human Fetal Brain: Reference and Segmentation Tools for Fetal Brain MRI Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of in-utero brain development is essential for understanding typical and atypical neurodevelopment. Building upon previous efforts to construct spatiotemporal fetal brain MRI atlases, we present the CRL-2025 fetal brain atlas, which is a spatiotemporal (4D) atlas of the developing fetal brain between 21 and 37 gestational weeks. This atlas is constructed from carefully processed MRI scans of 160 fetuses with typically-developing brains using a diffeomorphic deformable registration framework integrated with kernel regression on age. CRL-2025 uniquely includes detailed tissue segmentations, transient white matter compartments, and parcellation into 126 anatomical regions. This atlas offers significantly enhanced anatomical details over the CRL-2017 atlas, and is released along with the CRL diffusion MRI atlas with its newly created tissue segmentation and labels as well as deep learning-based multiclass segmentation models for fine-grained fetal brain MRI segmentation. The CRL-2025 atlas and its associated tools provide a robust and scalable platform for fetal brain MRI segmentation, groupwise analysis, and early neurodevelopmental research, and these materials are publicly released to support the broader research community.</description>
