      <title>Testing Tensor Products of Algebraic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in locally testable codes and quantum LDPCs based on robust testability of tensor product codes, we explore the local testability of tensor products of (an abstraction of) algebraic geometry codes. Such codes are parameterized by, in addition to standard parameters such as block length $n$ and dimension $k$, their genus $g$. We show that the tensor product of two algebraic geometry codes is robustly locally testable provided $n = \Omega((k+g)^2)$. Apart from Reed-Solomon codes, this seems to be the first explicit family of codes of super-constant dual distance that is robustly locally testable.</description>

      <title>Error correction in interference-limited wireless systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to error correction decoding in the presence of additive alpha-stable noise, which serves as a model of interference-limited wireless systems. In the absence of modifications to decoding algorithms, treating alpha-stable distributions as Gaussian results in significant performance loss. Building on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND), we consider two approaches. The first accounts for alpha-stable noise in the evaluation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) that serve as input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). The second builds on an ORBGRAND variant that was originally designed to account for jamming that treats outlying LLRs as erasures. This results in a hybrid error and erasure correcting decoder that corrects errors via ORBGRAND and corrects erasures via Gaussian elimination. The block error rate (BLER) performance of both approaches are similar. Both outperform decoding assuming that the LLRs originated from Gaussian noise by 2 to 3 dB for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes.</description>

      <title>Centimeter-level Geometry Reconstruction and Material Identification in 300 GHz Monostatic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is envisioned to achieve high communication performance alongside advanced sensing abilities. For various applications of ISAC, accurate environment reconstruction including geometry reconstruction and material identification is critical. This paper presents a highly precise geometry reconstruction algorithm and material identification scheme for a monostatic sensing case in a typical indoor scenario. Experiments are conducted in the frequency range from 290 GHz to 310 GHz using a vector network analyzer (VNA)-based channel sounder by co-locating the transmitter and receiver. A joint delay and angle space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)-based algorithm is implemented to estimate multipath component (MPC) parameters and the indoor geometry is reconstructed based on the extracted parameters. Furthermore, a geometry-based method is employed to model and remove the spurious path of the corner, reaching an accuracy of 1.75 cm. Additionally, a material database using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is established, capturing reflection losses of over 200 common material samples. Applying this database to our monostatic sensing, the measured reflection losses of wall and window frame are accurately identified as cement and steel, respectively. Our results demonstrate the centimeter-level geometry reconstruction and accurate material identification for practical THz ISAC scenarios, which unleash unprecedented sensing potential compared to microwave and millimeter-wave bands.</description>

      <title>MMSE Channel Estimation in Fading MIMO Gaussian Channels With Blockage: A Novel Lower Bound via Poincar\'e Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks. To optimize the transmitted waveform for both sensing and communication, various performance metrics must be considered. This work focuses on sensing, and specifically on the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation. Given the complexity of deriving the MSE, the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound (BCRB) is commonly recognized as a lower bound on the minimum MSE. However, the BCRB is not applicable to channels with discrete or mixed distributions. To address this limitation, a new lower bound based on a Poincar\'e inequality is proposed and applied to fading MIMO AWGN channels with blockage probability, and the behavior of the lower bound at high SNR is precisely characterized.</description>

      <title>ISAC Prototype System for Multi-Domain Cooperative Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are poised to transform into integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks, unlocking groundbreaking services such as digital twinning. To harness the full potential of ISAC networks, it is essential to experimentally validate their sensing capabilities and the role of sensing in boosting communication. However, current prototype systems fall short in supporting multiple sensing functions or validating sensing-assisted communication. In response, we have developed an advanced ISAC prototype system that incorporates monostatic, bistatic, and network sensing modes. This system supports multimodal data collection and synchronization, ensuring comprehensive experimental validation. On the communication front, it excels in sensing-aided beam tracking and real-time high-definition video transmission. For sensing applications, it provides precise angle and range measurements, real-time angle-range imaging, and radio-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Our prototype aligns with the 5G New Radio standard, offering scalability for up to 16 user equipments (UEs) in uplink transmission and 10 UEs in downlink transmission. Real-world tests showcase the system's superior accuracy, with root mean square errors of 2.3 degrees for angle estimation and 0.3 meters (m) for range estimation. Additionally, the estimation errors for multimodal-aided real-time radio SLAM localization and mapping are 0.25 m and 0.8 m, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel algorithm for solving mismatch problem in compressed sensing. Its core is to transform mismatch problem into matched by constructing a new measurement matrix to match measurement value under unknown measurement matrix. Therefore, we propose mismatch equation and establish two types of algorithm based on it, which are matched solution of unknown measurement matrix and calibration of unknown measurement matrix. Experiments have shown that when under low gaussian noise levels, the constructed measurement matrix can transform the mismatch problem into matched and recover original images. The code is available: https://github.com/yanglebupt/mismatch-solution</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning and Adversarial Disentanglement for Privacy-Preserving Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication systems have emerged as a promising approach to achieving efficient and intelligent data transmission, where only information relevant to a specific task is communicated. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and subpar performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD leverages contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the lack of reliable and reproducible methods to gain insight into the informativeness and minimality of the encoded feature vectors, we introduce a new technique to compute the information retention index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input, reflecting the minimality of the encoded features. The IRI quantifies the minimality and informativeness of the encoded feature vectors across different task-oriented communication techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI. CLAD achieves a predictive performance improvement of around 2.5-3%, along with a 77-90% reduction in IRI and a 57-76% decrease in adversarial accuracy.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds via Conditional $f$-Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce novel information-theoretic generalization bounds using the conditional $f$-information framework, an extension of the traditional conditional mutual information (MI) framework. We provide a generic approach to derive generalization bounds via $f$-information in the supersample setting, applicable to both bounded and unbounded loss functions. Unlike previous MI-based bounds, our proof strategy does not rely on upper bounding the cumulant-generating function (CGF) in the variational formula of MI. Instead, we set the CGF or its upper bound to zero by carefully selecting the measurable function invoked in the variational formula. Although some of our techniques are partially inspired by recent advances in the coin-betting framework (e.g., Jang et al. (2023)), our results are independent of any previous findings from regret guarantees of online gambling algorithms. Additionally, our newly derived MI-based bound recovers many previous results and improves our understanding of their potential limitations. Finally, we empirically compare various $f$-information measures for generalization, demonstrating the improvement of our new bounds over the previous bounds.</description>

      <title>Computation of a Unified Graph-Based Rate Optimization Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a graph-based rate optimization problem and consider its computation, which provides a unified approach to the computation of various theoretical limits, including the (conditional) graph entropy, rate-distortion functions and capacity-cost functions with side information. Compared with their classical counterparts, theoretical limits with side information are much more difficult to compute since their characterizations as optimization problems have larger and more complex feasible regions. Following the unified approach, we develop effective methods to resolve the difficulty. On the theoretical side, we derive graph characterizations for rate-distortion and capacity-cost functions with side information and simplify the characterizations in special cases by reducing the number of decision variables. On the computational side, we design an efficient alternating minimization algorithm for the graph-based problem, which deals with the inequality constraint by a flexible multiplier update strategy. Moreover, simplified graph characterizations are exploited and deflation techniques are introduced, so that the computing time is greatly reduced. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm converges to an optimal solution. By numerical experiments, the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are illustrated and its significant advantage over existing methods is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Solving Quadratic Systems with Full-Rank Matrices Using Sparse or Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of recovering a signal $\boldsymbol x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ from a quadratic system $\{y_i=\boldsymbol x^\top\boldsymbol A_i\boldsymbol x,\ i=1,\ldots,m\}$ with full-rank matrices $\boldsymbol A_i$ frequently arises in applications such as unassigned distance geometry and sub-wavelength imaging. With i.i.d. standard Gaussian matrices $\boldsymbol A_i$, this paper addresses the high-dimensional case where $m\ll n$ by incorporating prior knowledge of $\boldsymbol x$. First, we consider a $k$-sparse $\boldsymbol x$ and introduce the thresholded Wirtinger flow (TWF) algorithm that does not require the sparsity level $k$. TWF comprises two steps: the spectral initialization that identifies a point sufficiently close to $\boldsymbol x$ (up to a sign flip) when $m=O(k^2\log n)$, and the thresholded gradient descent which, when provided a good initialization, produces a sequence linearly converging to $\boldsymbol x$ with $m=O(k\log n)$ measurements. Second, we explore the generative prior, assuming that $x$ lies in the range of an $L$-Lipschitz continuous generative model with $k$-dimensional inputs in an $\ell_2$-ball of radius $r$. With an estimate correlated with the signal, we develop the projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm that also comprises two steps: the projected power method that provides an initial vector with $O\big(\sqrt{\frac{k \log L}{m}}\big)$ $\ell_2$-error given $m=O(k\log(Lnr))$ measurements, and the projected gradient descent that refines the $\ell_2$-error to $O(\delta)$ at a geometric rate when $m=O(k\log\frac{Lrn}{\delta^2})$. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that: (i) our approach for the sparse case notably outperforms the existing provable algorithm sparse power factorization; (ii) leveraging the generative prior allows for precise image recovery in the MNIST dataset from a small number of quadratic measurements.</description>

      <title>Successive Bayesian Reconstructor for Channel Estimation in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) can reconfigure their antenna locations freely within a spatially continuous space. To keep favorable antenna positions, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition for FASs is essential. While some techniques have been proposed, most existing FAS channel estimators require several channel assumptions, such as slow variation and angular-domain sparsity. When these assumptions are not reasonable, the model mismatch may lead to unpredictable performance losses. In this paper, we propose the successive Bayesian reconstructor (S-BAR) as a general solution to estimate FAS channels. Unlike model-based estimators, the proposed S-BAR is prior-aided, which builds the experiential kernel for CSI acquisition. Inspired by Bayesian regression, the key idea of S-BAR is to model the FAS channels as a stochastic process, whose uncertainty can be successively eliminated by kernel-based sampling and regression. In this way, the predictive mean of the regressed stochastic process can be viewed as a Bayesian channel estimator. Simulation results verify that, in both model-mismatched and model-matched cases, the proposed S-BAR can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Computation and Critical Transitions of Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions With Wasserstein Barycenter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function characterizes the three-way trade-off between description rate, average distortion, and perceptual quality measured by discrepancy between probability distributions and has been applied to emerging areas in communications empowered by generative modeling. We study several variants of the RDP functions through the lens of optimal transport to characterize their critical transitions. By transforming the information RDP function into a Wasserstein Barycenter problem, we identify the critical transitions when one of the constraints becomes inactive. Further, the non-strictly convexity brought by the perceptual constraint can be regularized by an entropy regularization term. We prove that the entropy regularized model converges to the original problem and propose an alternating iteration method based on the Sinkhorn algorithm to numerically solve the regularized optimization problem. In many practical scenarios, the computation of the Distortion-Rate-Perception (DRP) function offers a solution to minimize distortion and perceptual discrepancy under rate constraints. However, the interchange of the rate objective and the distortion constraint significantly amplifies the complexity. The proposed method effectively addresses this complexity, providing an efficient solution for DRP functions. Using our numerical method, we propose a reverse data hiding scheme that imperceptibly embeds a secret message into an image, ensuring perceptual fidelity and achieving a significant improvement in the perceptual quality of the stego image compared to traditional methods under the same embedding rate. Our theoretical results and numerical method lay an attractive foundation for steganographic communications with perceptual quality constraints.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, some new upper bounds for Kullback-Leibler divergence(KL-divergence) based on $L^1, L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms of density functions are discussed. Our findings unveil that the convergence in KL-divergence sense sandwiches between the convergence of density functions in terms of $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. Furthermore, we endeavor to apply our newly derived upper bounds to the analysis of the rate theorem of the entropic conditional central limit theorem.</description>
