      <title>Exact generalized Bethe eigenstates of the non-integrable alternating Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact solutions of quantum lattice models serve as useful guides for interpreting physical phenomena in condensed matter systems. Prominent examples of integrability appear in one dimension, including the Heisenberg chain, where the Bethe ansatz method has been widely successful. Recent work has noted that certain non-integrable models harbor quantum many-body scar states, which form a superspin of regular states hidden in an otherwise chaotic spectrum. Here we consider one of the simplest examples of a non-integrable model, the alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (bond-staggered) Heisenberg chain, a close cousin of the spin-1 Haldane chain and a spin analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show the presence of exponentially many zero-energy states. We highlight features of the alternating chain that allow treatment with the Bethe ansatz (with important modifications) and surprisingly for a non-integrable system, we find simple compact expressions for zero-energy eigenfunctions for a few magnons including solutions with fractionalized particle momentum. We discuss a general numerical recipe to diagnose the existence of such generalized Bethe ansatz (GBA) states and also provide exact analytic expressions for the entanglement of such states. We conclude by conjecturing a picture of magnon pairing which may generalize to multiple magnons. Our work opens the avenue to describe certain eigenstates of partially integrable systems using the GBA.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum many-body scars tunable from volume to area law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of a manifold of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. We construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates in an exponentially degenerate manifold for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. A symmetric superposition of the triplet basis of antipodal spin pairs provides a rich manifold for the construction of states with extensive, logarithmic, and short-range entanglement by tuning the distribution of triplet states. We show the volume-law entangled states despite being in the middle of the spectrum host non-thermal expectation values of local observables. Certain quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and a novel method of quantum state construction.</description>

      <title>Effects of electron correlation on resonant Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry gives rise to the Edelstein effect, which is the induced spin polarization in response to an applied electric field or current, and the inverse Edelstein effect, which is the induced electric current in response to an oscillatory magnetic field or spin polarization. At the same time, an interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction leads to a special type of collective excitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of spin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies of spin-chiral collective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the effect of electron correlation on the Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects in a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas and a multi-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. While the chiral-spin modes involve both in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations of spins, we show that only the in-plane modes are responsible for the above resonances. In the multi-valley system, electron correlation splits the in-plane modes into two. We also study the spectral weight distribution between the two resonances over a large parameter space of intra- and inter-valley interactions.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking, collective modes, and Raman spectrum in pair-density-wave states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by empirical evidence of the existence of pair-density-wave (PDW) order in certain underdoped cuprates, we investigate the collective modes in systems with unidirectional PDW order with momenta $\pm {Q}$ and a $d$-wave form-factor with special focus on the amplitude (Higgs) modes. In the pure PDW state, there are two overdamped Higgs modes. We show that a phase with co-existing PDW and uniform ($d$-wave) superconducting (SC) order, PDW/SC, spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry - and thus is distinct from a simpler phase, SC/CDW, with coexisting SC and charge-density-wave (CDW) order. The PDW/SC phase exhibits three Higgs modes, one of which is sharply peaked and is predominantly a PDW fluctuation, symmetric between ${Q}$ and -${Q}$, whose damping rate is strongly reduced by SC. This sharp mode should be visible in Raman experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical response in a ferromagnetic insulating manganite: Pr$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$MnO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic generation from Pr$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$MnO$_{3}$ was investigated across a high-temperature paramagnetic phase and a low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. As the temperature decreases, the harmonic intensity gradually increases in the paramagnetic phase like that in different composition material Pr$_{0.6}$Ca$_{0.4}$MnO$_{3}$. However, it turns to a decrease in the ferromagnetic phase. We propose a possible interpretation of the anomaly around the ferromagnetic transition temperature considering the thermal fluctuation of orbital order and the metal-insulator phase separation in the ferromagnetic insulating phase.</description>

      <title>On the multi-$\mathbf{q}$ characteristics of magnetic ground states of honeycomb cobalt oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev honeycomb model has received significant attention for its exactly solvable quantum spin liquid ground states and fractionalized excitations. For realizing the model, layered cobalt oxides have been considered a promising platform. Yet, in contrast to the conventional wisdom about single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag magnetic order inferred from previous studies of the Na$_2$IrO$_3$ and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ candidate materials, recent experiments on two of the representative honeycomb cobalt oxides, hexagonal Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ and monoclinic Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, have uncovered evidence for more complex multi-$\mathbf{q}$ variants of the zigzag order. This review surveys on experimental strategies to distinguish between single- and multi-$\mathbf{q}$ orders, along with the crystallographic symmetries of the cobalt oxides in comparison to the previously studied systems. General formation mechanism of multi-$\mathbf{q}$ order is also briefly discussed. The goal is to provide some rationales for examining the relevance of multi-$\mathbf{q}$ order in the honeycomb cobalt oxides, along with its implications on the microscopic model of these intriguing quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When considering magnetic systems in the thermodynamic limit and at low enough temperature, one finds typically magnetically ordered phases. In contrast, in the high-temperature regime, the interactions between the spin degrees of freedom become less relevant and the system loses its order: this is a paramagnet. This phenomenon of phase transition has been well understood using statistical mechanics and simple modelling.
  In these short lecture notes, we will review the possibility that a many-body magnetic system may remain magnetically disordered down to zero-temperature, both for classical or quantum spins. These exotic phases of matter are known, respectively, as classical and quantum spin liquids.
  We will address in particular the question of classification of these classical or quantum disordered phases. Indeed, while they have no local order parameter by definition, they can still possess different qualitative features related e.g. to the nature of their correlations or elementary excitations, which could be probed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We investigate bond-algebraic dualities in these systems and show that distinct module tensor categories $\mathcal{M}$ over the same braided fusion category $\mathcal{B}$ give rise to dual lattice models. This extends the 1+1d result that dualities in anyon chains are classified by module categories over fusion categories. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space, dual to the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ XXZ model on the honeycomb lattice, and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model, dual to a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ model with XXZ and Ising interactions. Unlike regular $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{B}$ fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} \neq \mathcal{B}$ can exhibit both 1-form and 0-form symmetries, including non-invertible ones.</description>

      <title>Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.</description>

      <title>Optical Response of Multi-orbital Superconductors: Role of Fermi Surface Topology and Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the possibility of shifting the nearest peak in the density of states relative to the Fermi level leading to a Lifshitz transition, such as through strain in Sr$^{}_2$RuO$^{}_4$, this study examines the consequent effects on Hall transport and the polar Kerr angle. Using a three-orbital model, variations in the chemical potential and $z$-direction hopping reveal $d+ig$- and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairings as leading candidates for pairing symmetry in the quasi-2D orbital within the weak-coupling regime. The Lifshitz transition is further analyzed for its impact on coherence factors and the density of states, both of which are crucial to response functions. Interactions with van Hove points and nearby degenerate electronic states emerge as key contributors to Hall-type responses, while electron transfer between quasi-1D and quasi-2D orbitals significantly modifies these transport properties.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Current Fluctuations in Quantum Wires through Charge Fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information measures of many-body systems often imply a measure with multi- or two regions such as bipartite charge fluctuations within the ground state revealing the logarithmic profile of the entanglement entropy in a quantum wire. Here, we introduce a new method from the bipartite current fluctuations and the divergence theorem. They reveal the fractional charges related to ground-state energetics and the proximity to Mott physics in the same ballistic quantum wires. This also encodes the behavior of the electron Green's function in space. With metallic gates on both sides of an interface to implement the protocol introducing the two macroscopic domains, bipartite current fluctuations can reveal an additional localized bound state associated to the topological Jackiw-Rebbi model, coexisting with the fractional charges. Through the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm we introduce a quantum spin chain analogue.</description>

      <title>Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been discovered as a high temperature superconductor with Tc near 80 K above 14 GPa.[1-3] The search for nickelate superconductors with higher Tc, the preparation of high-quality single crystals, and the removal of high-pressure conditions including single crystal growth under high gas pressure and achievement of high Tc superconductivity under high pressure, are the most challenging tasks. Here, we present ambient pressure flux growth of high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity up to 91 K under high pressure. Single crystals of bilayer La3-xRxNi2O7-y with dimensions up to 220 um on the edge were successfully grown using flux method at atmosphere conditions. Single crystal X-ray diffraction, nuclear quadrupole resonance, energy dispersion spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements evidenced high quality of bilayer La2SmNi2O7-y single crystals in average structure and local structure. Superconductivity has been observed in high pressure resistivity measurements of annealed La2SmNi2O7-y single crystals with Tc onset up to 91 K, which is the highest among the known superconducting nickelates. Our results not only demonstrate a new and easy-to-access method for synthesizing high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals, but also providing a direction for discovering superconducting nickelates with higher Tc.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and crystal electric field studies of two Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the low-temperature magnetic properties of two Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice compounds NaSrYb(BO$_3$)$_2$ and K$_3$YbSi$_2$O$_7$ via thermodynamic measurements followed by crystal electric field (CEF) calculations. Magnetization and specific heat data as well as the CEF energy levels confirm that the ground state is characterized by the low-lying Kramers' doublet of Yb$^{3+}$ with effective spin-1/2 ($J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$). A small Curie-Weiss temperature and scaling of magnetic isotherms corroborate very weak magnetic correlations among $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ spins. The crystal field parameters are calculated using the point charge model and the CEF Hamiltonian is determined for both the compounds. The simulation using the eigenvalues of the CEF Hamiltonian reproduces the experimental susceptibility, magnetic isotherm, and magnetic specific heat data very well. The large separation between the ground state and first excited state doublets implies that the ground state is a Kramers' doublet with $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ at low temperatures, endorsing the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Landscape of Correlated Orders in Strained Bilayer Nickelate Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has sparked significant research interest. This interest has been further fueled by the recent achievement of superconductivity in compressed thin films at ambient pressure, although the origin and underlying mechanism remain elusive. In this work, we explore the electronic structures and instabilities of strained thin films on substrates to identify the key factors for achieving superconductivity, using first-principles and functional renormalization group calculations. Our findings suggest that the compressed NiO$_2$ bilayer near the interface is unlikely to exhibit superconductivity, despite its electron-doped nature. In contrast, the NiO$_2$ bilayer away from the interface shows density-wave instability when undoped or slightly hole-doped. However, when this bilayer is hole-doped, leading to the emergence of a hole pocket around the M point, it exhibits robust $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, which may account for superconductivity observed in thin films. For the stretched NiO$_2$ bilayer, robust spin-density-wave instability is observed due to enhanced Fermi surface nesting, despite the presence of a hole pocket around the M point. Potential experimental implications are discussed. Our study highlights the crucial role of fermiology in determining electronic instability and establishes a unified scenario for superconductivity in both pressurized bulk and strained thin films of bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Nano-welding of quantum spin-$1/2$ chains at minimal dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of switching on a coupling term between two quantum many-body systems. Specifically, we (i) quantify the energetic cost of establishing a weak junction between two quantum spin-$1/2$ chains in finite time $\tau$ and (ii) identify the energetically optimal protocol to realize it. For linear driving protocols, we find that for long times the excess (irreversible) work scales as $\tau^{-\eta}$, where $\eta=1, 2$ or a nonuniversal number depending on the phase of the chains. Interestingly, increasing a $J_z$ anisotropy in the chains suppresses the excess work thus promoting quasi-adiabaticity. The general optimal control problem is solved, employing a Chebyshev ansatz. We find that the optimal control protocol is intimately sensitive to the chain phases.</description>

      <title>Elastic softness of low-symmetry frustrated $A$Ti$_2$O$_5$ ($A$ = Co, Fe)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthorhombic pseudobrookites CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ have a low-symmetry crystal structure comprising magnetic Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions and nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ ions, where the orbital-nondegenerate Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions form one-dimensional chains running along the orthorhombic $a$ axis. These compounds undergo an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \sim$ 26 K for CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and $T_N \sim$ 40 K for FeTi$_2$O$_5$. Ultrasound velocity measurements on single crystals of CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ reveal that CoTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits unusual elastic softness above $T_N$ in the symmetry-lowering elastic mode of $ac$-plane shear elastic modulus, inconsistent with the structural symmetry breaking caused by antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N$. This suggests the presence of two distinct types of magnetostructural fluctuations above $T_N$ that should be a precursor to the symmetry-lowering lattice distortion at $T_N$. In contrast, FeTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits either negligible or smaller elastic softness, indicating weaker spin-lattice coupling. These findings highlight CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ as unique spin-latticed-coupled frustrated systems with low crystal symmetry, where, while the exchange interactions are quasi-one-dimensional in nature, the frustration is released by further lowering the crystal symmetry through three-dimensional spin-lattice coupling, which is stronger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking phases of many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions representing transient processes during which some characteristics of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Matching the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one consistently with nontrivial quantum dynamics is a long-standing, unresolved problem. We argue that the two-particle propagators may contain only even powers of the anomalous Green functions to make the thermodynamic system conserving. Only then can we continuously match the symmetry-breaking phase with the normal one at the single transition point. We use the antiferromagnetic phase of a dynamical mean-field approximation to disclose universal features of the impact of quantum dynamics on the thermodynamic and spectral properties of the ordered state.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Hermitian symmetry in tensor network algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploiting symmetries in tensor network algorithms plays a key role for reducing the computational and memory costs. Here we explain how to incorporate the Hermitian symmetry in double-layer tensor networks, which naturally arise in methods based on projected entangled-pair states (PEPS). For real-valued tensors the Hermitian symmetry defines a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry on the combined bra and ket auxiliary level of the tensors. By implementing this symmetry, a speedup of the computation time by up to a factor 4 can be achieved, while expectation values of observables and reduced density matrices remain Hermitian by construction. Benchmark results based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) and higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) are presented. We also discuss how to implement the Hermitian symmetry in the complex case, where a similar speedup can be achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.</description>

      <title>Spin Liquid Landscapes in the Kagome Lattice: A Variational Monte Carlo Study of the Chiral Heisenberg Model and Experimental Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral spin liquids (CSL), which break time-reversal symmetry, are of great interest due to their topological properties and fractionalized excitations (anyons). In this work, we investigate CSL on the kagome lattice arising from the competition between the third-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction across hexagons ($J_d$) and a staggered scalar spin chirality term ($J_\chi$). Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between $J_d$ and $J_\chi$ induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs-including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magnetoelectric effects-which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.</description>

      <title>Spin excitations arising from anisotropic Dirac spinons in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{0.33}$(OD)$_{0.67}$]</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have revealed cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and consistent with our theoretical modeling and simulations. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also accords with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, clearly demonstrating the negligible effects of magnetic impurities on static susceptibility. These results provide a rare example in studying quantum-spin-liquid materials where different experimental techniques can be directly compared and give further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring new unconventional superconductors is of great value for both fundamental research and practical applications. It is a long-term challenge to develop and study more hole-doped superconductors in 1111 system of iron-based superconductors. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity with a critical transition temperature up to 30.7 K in the compound CaFeAsF by a post-annealing treatment in air atmosphere. The superconducting behaviors are verified in both the single-crystalline and polycrystalline samples by the resistance and magnetization measurements. The analysis by combining the depth-resolved time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements shows that the introduction of oxygen elements and the consequent changing in Fe valence by the annealing treatment may lead to the hole-type doping, which is the origin for the occurrence of superconductivity. Our results pave the way for further in-depth investigations on the hole-doped 1111 system in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has ignited stark interest within the scientific community, particularly regarding its likely unconventional origin. Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</description>

This construction, which is based only on symmetry considerations, allows for a direct derivation of number and types of Nambu-Goldstone fields in a classical field theory without any reference to effective Lagrangian. A central role in classification is shown to be played by Lorentz-symmetry breaking order parameter which induces symplectic structure in the field space of the theory.</description>

      <title>Electric-field switchable chirality in rhombohedral graphene Chern insulators stabilized by tungsten diselenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chern insulators host topologically protected chiral edge currents with quantized conductance characterized by their Chern number. Switching the chirality of a Chern insulator, namely, the direction of the edge current, is highly challenging due to topologically forbidden backscattering but is of considerable importance for the design of topological devices. Nevertheless, this can be achieved by reversing the sign of the Chern number through a topological phase transition. Here, we report electrically switchable chirality in rhombohedral multilayer graphene-based Chern insulators. By introducing moire superlattices in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, we observed a cascade of topological phase transitions at quarter electron filling of a moire band with the Chern number tunable from -1, 1 to 2. Furthermore, integrating monolayer tungsten diselenide at the moireless interface of rhombohedral decalayer graphene/h-BN superlattices stabilizes the Chern insulators, enabling quantized anomalous Hall resistance of h/2e^2. Remarkably, the Chern number can be switched from -1 to 2 using displacement fields. Our work establishes rhombohedral multilayer graphene moire superlattices as a versatile platform for topological engineering, with switchable chirality offering significant promise for integrating chiral edge currents into topological electronic circuits.</description>

      <title>Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08405v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations with systematic approximations. It goes beyond various high-frequency expansion methods commonly used in Floquet theory, as we demonstrate with the example of the driven Fermi-Hubbard model. In the limit of high driving frequencies, the FSWT Hamiltonian reduces to the widely used Floquet-Magnus result. We anticipate this method will be useful for designing Rydberg multi-qubit gates, controlling correlated hopping in quantum simulations in optical lattices, and describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <title>Sunny.jl: A Julia Package for Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sunny is a Julia package designed to serve the needs of the quantum magnetism community. It supports the specification of a very broad class of spin models and a diverse suite of numerical solvers. These include powerful methods for simulating spin dynamics both in and out of equilibrium. Uniquely, it features a broad generalization of classical and semiclassical approaches to SU(N) coherent states, which is useful for studying systems exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling or local entanglement effects. Sunny also offers a well-developed framework for calculating the dynamical spin structure factor, enabling direct comparison with scattering experiments. Ease of use is a priority, with tools for symmetry-guided modeling and interactive visualization.</description>
