      <title>Transient chaos and Rayleigh particle escape out of a time modulated optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Rayleigh particles in a periodically modulated optical trap formed by two counter-propagating Gaussian beams. It is shown that for certain values of parameters the system exhibits transient chaos which manifests itself in particle acceleration and subsequent directional ejection out of the trap. The escape flights are terminated at the distance of hundreds wavelengths from the trap centrum and the particles return to the trap under the action of the Stokes force. The particle escape is shown to be a threshold effect that can be potentially employed for particle sorting.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Parameter Control Using AAN for Lower Limb Rehabilitation Exoskeletons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoskeletons play a crucial role in assisting patients with varying mobility levels during rehabilitation. However, existing control strategies face challenges such as imprecise trajectory tracking, interaction torque oscillations, and limited adaptability to diverse patient conditions. To address these issues, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control algorithm that integrates a human-robot coupling dynamics model, a human torque-momentum observer (HTMO), and an adaptive parameter controller (APC). The algorithm first employs inverse dynamics to compute the joint torques required for the rehabilitation trajectory. The HTMO then estimates the torque exerted by the patient's joints and determines the torque error, which the exoskeleton compensates for via a spring-damper system, ultimately generating the target trajectory. Finally, the APC ensures adaptive assistive control. The proposed method is validated for its effectiveness in MATLAB/Simulink.</description>

      <title>Optical feedback induced irregular and chaotic dynamics in terahertz quantum cascade laser combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the optical feedback dynamics of terahertz (THz) frequency combs generated from quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) using the effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations (ESMBEs). Starting from a free-running comb state at low bias (1.3Ith), we identify clear bifurcation routes as the external feedback is increased. In the weak feedback regime (C&lt;1), the frequency comb operation remains stable; as feedback increases to the moderate feedback regime (1&lt;C&lt;2.4), the system transitions through frequency splitting into period-one (P1) oscillations around each comb, followed by higher-order bifurcations (P2, P4, P8). Within the range 2.4&lt;C&lt;13.86, only combs with P1 states are observed, with the split frequency increasing continuously with feedback strength. In the strong feedback regime (C&gt;13.86), complex feedback dynamics re-emerged but with significantly reduced complexity compared with the weak feedback regime. More interestingly, we show that optical feedback can induce chaotic THz emission at higher bias current conditions (&gt;1.6Ith), when the free-running laser output (C=0) is originally a stable frequency comb. The resulting chaotic dynamics, characterized by broadband spectra and large positive Lyapunov exponents, are shown to depend strongly on the linewidth enhancement factor. Although THz QCLs widely considered as ultrastable under external perturbations, this work provides the first detailed report of chaotic dynamics and routes to chaos in THz QCLs under optical feedback. These findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in THz QCLs but also open new possibilities for exploiting applications of chaotic light in THz sensing, imaging and secure communications.</description>

      <title>Deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonances in two coupled Lorenz oscillators: numerical study versus experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonance phenomena in two coupled identical chaotic Lorenz oscillators. Both effects are found to occur simultaneously when varying the coupling strength. In particular, the occurrence of deterministic coherence resonance is revealed by analysing time realizations $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ of both oscillators, whereas the anti-coherence resonance is identified when considering oscillations $z(t)$ at the same parameter values. Both resonances are observed when the coupling strength does not exceed a threshold value corresponding to complete synchronization of the interacting chaotic oscillators. In such a case, the coupled oscillators exhibit the hyperchaotic dynamics associated with the on-off intermittency. The highlighted effects are studied in numerical simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.</description>
