      <title>Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based on Graph-Induced Local Value Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.13046v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving distributed reinforcement learning (RL) for large-scale cooperative multi-agent systems (MASs) is challenging because: (i) each agent has access to only limited information; (ii) issues on convergence or computational complexity emerge due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a general computationally efficient distributed framework for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by utilizing the structures of graphs involved in this problem. We introduce three coupling graphs describing three types of inter-agent couplings in MARL, namely, the state graph, the observation graph and the reward graph. By further considering a communication graph, we propose two distributed RL approaches based on local value-functions derived from the coupling graphs. The first approach is able to reduce sample complexity significantly under specific conditions on the aforementioned four graphs. The second approach provides an approximate solution and can be efficient even for problems with dense coupling graphs. Here there is a trade-off between minimizing the approximation error and reducing the computational complexity. Simulations show that our RL algorithms have a significantly improved scalability to large-scale MASs compared with centralized and consensus-based distributed RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>What is the Solution for State-Adversarial Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02705v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various methods for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) have been developed with the assumption that agents' policies are based on accurate state information. However, policies learned through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are susceptible to adversarial state perturbation attacks. In this work, we propose a State-Adversarial Markov Game (SAMG) and make the first attempt to investigate different solution concepts of MARL under state uncertainties. Our analysis shows that the commonly used solution concepts of optimal agent policy and robust Nash equilibrium do not always exist in SAMGs. To circumvent this difficulty, we consider a new solution concept called robust agent policy, where agents aim to maximize the worst-case expected state value. We prove the existence of robust agent policy for finite state and finite action SAMGs. Additionally, we propose a Robust Multi-Agent Adversarial Actor-Critic (RMA3C) algorithm to learn robust policies for MARL agents under state uncertainties. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods when faced with state perturbations and greatly improves the robustness of MARL policies. Our code is public on https://songyanghan.github.io/what_is_solution/.</description>

      <title>MAP-NBV: Multi-agent Prediction-guided Next-Best-View Planning for Active 3D Object Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-Best View (NBV) planning is a long-standing problem of determining where to obtain the next best view of an object from, by a robot that is viewing the object. There are a number of methods for choosing NBV based on the observed part of the object. In this paper, we investigate how predicting the unobserved part helps with the efficiency of reconstructing the object. We present, Multi-Agent Prediction-Guided NBV (MAP-NBV), a decentralized coordination algorithm for active 3D reconstruction with multi-agent systems. Prediction-based approaches have shown great improvement in active perception tasks by learning the cues about structures in the environment from data. However, these methods primarily focus on single-agent systems. We design a decentralized next-best-view approach that utilizes geometric measures over the predictions and jointly optimizes the information gain and control effort for efficient collaborative 3D reconstruction of the object. Our method achieves 19% improvement over the non-predictive multi-agent approach in simulations using AirSim and ShapeNet. We make our code publicly available through our project website: http://raaslab.org/projects/MAPNBV/.</description>

      <title>Short vs. Long-term Coordination of Drones: When Distributed Optimization Meets Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09852v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Swarms of autonomous interactive drones, with the support of recharging technology, can provide compelling sensing capabilities in Smart Cities, such as traffic monitoring and disaster response. This paper aims to deliver a novel coordination solution for the cost-effective navigation, sensing, and recharging of drones. Existing approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer long-term adaptability, but lack energy efficiency, resilience, and flexibility in dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach where each drone independently determines its flying direction and recharging place using DRL, while adapting navigation and sensing through distributed optimization, which improves energy-efficiency during sensing tasks. Furthermore, drones efficiently exchange information while retaining decision-making autonomy via a structured tree communication model. Extensive experimentation with datasets generated from realistic urban mobility underscores an outstanding performance of the proposed solution compared to state-of-the-art methods. Significant new insights show that long-term methods optimize scarce drone resource for traffic management, while the integration of short-term methods is crucial for advising on charging policies and maintaining battery safety.</description>
