      <title>Attochaos I: The classically chaotic postcursor of high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond physics provides unique insights into light-matter interaction on ultrafast time scales. Its core phenomenon, High Harmonic Generation (HHG), is often described by a classical recollision model, the simple-man or three-step model, where the atomic potential is disregarded. Many features are already well explained using this model; however, the simplicity of the model does not allow the possibility of classical chaotic motion. We show that beyond this model, classical chaotic motion does exist albeit on timescales that are generally longer than the first recollision time. Chaos is analyzed using tools from the theory of dynamical systems, such as Lyapunov exponents and stroboscopic maps. The calculations are done for a one-dimensional Coulomb potential subjected to a linearly polarized electric field.</description>

      <title>On minimizing cyclists' ascent times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03363v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, given an average power, the ascent time is minimized if a cyclist maintains a constant ground speed regardless of the slope. Herein, minimizing the time is equivalent to maximizing -- for a given uphill -- the corresponding mean ascent velocity (VAM: velocit\`a ascensionale media), which is a common training metric. We illustrate the proof with numerical examples, and show that, in general, maintaining a constant instantaneous power results in longer ascent times; both strategies result in the same time if the slope is constant. To remain within the athlete's capacity, we examine the effect of complementing the average-power constraint with a maximum-power constraint. Even with this additional constraint, the ascent time is the shortest with a modified constant-speed -- not constant-power -- strategy; as expected, both strategies result in the same time if the maximum and average powers are equal to one another. Given standard available information -- including level of fitness, quantified by the power output, and ascent profile -- our results allow to formulate reliable and convenient strategies of uphill timetrials.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of the probabilities of rare events in cluster-cluster aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an action formalism to calculate probabilities of rare events in cluster-cluster aggregation for arbitrary collision kernels and establish a pathwise large deviation principle with total mass being the rate. As an application, the rate function for the number of surviving particles as well as the optimal evolution trajectory are calculated exactly for the constant, sum and product kernels. For the product kernel, we argue that the second derivative of the rate function has a discontinuity. The theoretical results agree with simulations tailored to the calculation of rare events.</description>
