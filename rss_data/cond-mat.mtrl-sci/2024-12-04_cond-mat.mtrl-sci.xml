      <title>Ultrafast dynamic Coulomb screening of X-ray core excitons in photoexcited semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy has been revolutionized in recent years due to the advent of fourth-generation X-ray facilities. In solid-state materials, core excitons determine the energy and line shape of absorption features in core-level spectroscopies such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The screening of core excitons is an inherent many-body process that can reveal insight into charge-transfer excitations and electronic correlations. Under non-equilibrium conditions such as after photoexcitation, however, core-exciton screening is still not fully understood. Here we demonstrate the dynamic Coulomb screening of core excitons induced by photoexcited carriers by employing X-ray transient absorption (XTA) spectroscopy with picosecond time resolution. Our interpretation is supported by state-of-the-art ab initio theory, combining constrained and real-time time-dependent density functional theory with many-body perturbation theory. Using ZnO as an archetypal wide band-gap semiconductor, we show that the Coulomb screening by photoexcited carriers at the Zn K-edge leads to a decrease in the core-exciton binding energy, which depends nonlinearly on both the excitation density and the distribution of photoexcited carriers in reciprocal space. The effect of Coulomb screening dominates over Pauli blocking in the XTA spectra. We show that dynamic core-exciton screening is also observed at other X-ray absorption edges and theoretically predict the effect of core-exciton screening on the femtosecond time scale for the case of ZnO, a major step towards hard X-ray excitonics. The results have implications for the interpretation of ultrafast X-ray spectra in general and their use in tracking charge carrier dynamics in complex materials on atomic length scales.</description>

      <title>Terahertz stimulated parametric downconversion of a magnon mode in an antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In condensed matter systems, interactions between collective modes offer avenues for nonlinear coherent manipulation of coupled excitations and quantum phases. Antiferromagnets, with their inherently coupled magnon modes, provide a promising platform for nonlinear control of microscopic spin waves and macroscopic magnetization. However, nonlinear magnon-magnon interactions have been only partially elaborated, leaving key gaps in the prospects for potential ultrahigh-bandwidth magnonic signal processing. Here, we use a pair of intense terahertz pulses to sequentially excite two distinct coherent magnon modes in an antiferromagnet and find that the magnon mode with a lower frequency undergoes amplification when the higher-frequency mode is driven. We unveil the nonlinear excitation pathways of this stimulated parametric downconversion process by using polarization-selective two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy. Our work provides fundamental insights into nonlinear magnonics in antiferromagnets, laying the groundwork for forthcoming spintronic and magnonic devices based on nonlinear magnon-magnon interactions.</description>

      <title>Cargo Delivery to Cells Using Laser-Irradiated Carbon-Black-Loaded PDMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective intracellular delivery is essential for successful gene editing of cells. Spatially selective delivery to cells that is simultaneously precise, consistent, and non-destructive remains challenging using conventional state-of-the-art techniques. Here, we introduce a carrier-free method for spatiotemporal delivery of fluorescently labeled cargo into both adherent and suspension cells using carbon-black-embedded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates irradiated by nanosecond laser pulses. This low-cost, biocompatible material, coupled with an optical approach, enables scalable, spatially selective, and sequential delivery of multiple cargo molecules, including FITC-dextran and siRNA, to a broad range of cells. Notably, we achieved siRNA delivery into the cytoplasm of hard-to-transfect K562 cells with 45% efficiency, while maintaining nearly 100% cell viability.</description>

      <title>Sublayers Editing of Covalent MAX Phase for Nanolaminated Early Transition Metal Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have gained popularity in fields such as energy storage, catalysis, and electromagnetic interference due to their diverse elemental compositions and variable surface terminations (T). Generally, the synthesis of MXene materials involves etching the weak M-A metallic bonds in the ternary layered transition metal carbides and nitrides (MAX phase) using HF acid or Lewis acid molten salts, while the strong M-X covalent bonds preserve the two-dimensional framework structure of MXenes. On the other hand, the MAX phase material family also includes a significant class of members where the A site is occupied by non-metal main group elements (such as sulfur and phosphorus), in which both M-A and M-X are covalent bond-type sublayers. The aforementioned etching methods cannot be used to synthesize MXene materials from these parent phases. In this work, we discovered that the covalent bond-type M-A and M-X sublayers exhibit different reactivity with some inorganic materials in a high-temperature molten state. By utilizing this difference in reactivity, we can structurally modify these covalent sublayers, allowing for the substitution of elements at the X site (from B to Se, S, P, C) and converting non-metal A site atoms in non-van der Waals (non-vdW) MAX phases into surface atoms in vdW layered materials. This results in a family of early transition metal Xide chalcogenides (TMXCs) that exhibit lattice characteristics of both MXenes and transition metal chalcogenides. Using electron-donor chemical scissors, these TMXC layered materials can be further exfoliated into monolayer nanosheets. The atomic configurations of each atom in these monolayer TMXCs are the same as those of conventional MXenes, but the oxidation states of the M-site atoms can be regulated by both X-site atoms and intercalated cations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the energy landscape of aluminas through machine learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02191v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum oxide (alumina, Al$_2$O$_3$) exists in various structures and has broad industrial applications. While the crystal structure of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is well-established, those of transitional aluminas remain highly debated. In this study, we propose a universal machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) for aluminas, trained using the neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach. The dataset is constructed through iterative training and farthest point sampling, ensuring the generation of the most representative configurations for an exhaustive sampling of the potential energy surface. The accuracy and generality of the potential are validated through simulations under a wide range of conditions, including high temperatures and pressures. A phase diagram is presented that includes both transitional aluminas and $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ based on the NEP. We also successfully extrapolate the phase diagram of aluminas under extreme conditions ([0, 4000] K and [0, 200] GPa ranges of temperature and pressure, respectively), while maintaining high accuracy in describing their properties under more moderate conditions. Furthermore, combined with our developed structure search workflow, the NEP provides an evaluation of existing $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ structure models. The NEP developed in this work enables highly accurate dynamic simulations of various aluminas on larger scales and longer timescales, while also offering new insights into the study of transitional aluminas structures.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Thermoelectric Figure of Merit in the Dirac Semimetal Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ by Band-Structure and -Filling Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials attract a considerable research interest because of their characteristic band structure giving rise to various new phenomena in quantum physics. Beside this, they are tempting from a functional materials point of view: Topological materials bear potential for an enhanced thermoelectric efficiency because they possess the required ingredients, such as intermediate carrier concentrations, large mobilities, heavy elements etc. Against this background, this work reports an enhanced thermoelectric performance of the topological Dirac semimetal Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ upon alloying the trivial semiconductor Zn$_{3}$As$_{2}$. This allows to gain fine-tuned control over both the band filling and the band topology in Cd$_{3-x}$Zn$_{x}$As$_{2}$. As a result, the thermoelectric figure of merit exceeds 0.5 around $x = 0.6$ and $x = 1.2$ at elevated temperatures. The former is due to an enhancement of the power factor, while the latter is a consequence of a strong suppression of the thermal conductivity. In addition, in terms of first-principle band structure calculations, the thermopower in this system is theoretically evaluated, which suggests that the topological aspects of the band structure change when traversing $x = 1.2$.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions dictate frequency dependence of thermal conductivity in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Fourier thermal transports have drawn significant attention for decades. Among them, the frequency dependent thermal conductivity has been extensively explored by pump-probe techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance, which is employed to probe the spectra of phonon mean free paths. However, previous studies on silicon have not exhibited apparent frequency dependence despite its broad phonon distribution. Here, we report the frequency dependent thermal transport in Al/Si with an atomically sharp interface, where the matched Debye temperatures preserve non-equilibrium between low- and high-energy phonons in Si. The dependence vanishes in Al/SiO$_2$/Si at room temperature, since the SiO$_2$ interlayer facilitates phonon scattering and destroys thermal non-equilibrium. At 80 K, frequency dependence reemerges in Al/SiO$_2$/Si, due to reduced interfacial phonon scattering. Our findings highlight the significance of boundary conditions in frequency dependent thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal transport in a room-temperature chiral magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral magnets under broken time-reversal symmetry can give rise to rectification of moving electrons, called nonreciprocal transport. Several mechanisms, such as the spin-fluctuation-induced chiral scattering and asymmetry in the electronic band dispersion with and without the relativistic spin-orbit interaction, have been proposed, but clear identification as well as theoretical description of these different contributions are desired for full understanding of nonreciprocal transport phenomena. Here, we investigate a chiral magnet Co8Zn9Mn3 and find the nonreciprocal transport phenomena consisting of different contributions with distinct field- and temperature-dependence across the magnetic phase diagram over a wide temperature range including above room-temperature. We successfully separate the nonreciprocal resistivity into different components and identify their mechanisms as spin-fluctuation-induced chiral scattering and band asymmetry in a single material with the help of theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of 4-spin chiral interaction in a 2D honeycomb ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broken inversion symmetry of magnetic lattice is normally described by Lifshitz invariants in micromagnetic energy functional. Three exceptions are the lattices with T$_\textrm{d}$, C$_\textrm{3h}$ and D$_\textrm{3h}$ point group symmetries. The inversion symmetry breaking of the corresponding magnets is described by more complex 4-spin chiral invariants that cannot be related to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Experimental detection of 4-spin chiral interactions is an important task that has yet to be performed. We propose that the 4-spin chiral interaction can be probed by energy selective magnon relaxation in two-dimensional ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ that possess D$_\textrm{3h}$ point group symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between magnetism and the topology of electronic structures provides a rich avenue for tailoring materials with unique and potent anomalous transport properties. In this paper, we present a strategy for inducing robust Berry curvature and anomalous transverse conductivity in noncollinear antiferromagnets through an unconventional approach termed ``small \textit{staggered rotation} of spin". Considering noncollinear Mn$_3$Sn, we demonstrate that the positive vector chirality antiferromagnetic configuration, typically associated with a vanishing anomalous Hall effect and Nernst effect, can be manipulated to exhibit finite anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) through \textit{staggered rotation}. Furthermore, we illustrate that the value and sign of both the AHC and ANC can be tuned through \textit{staggered rotation}. This tuning is intricately influenced by the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced gapped nodal line, revealing the critical role of electronic structure modifications in achieving precise control over transport properties.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\vartheta -$functions for the identification of topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three dimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can be expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals.
  The resulting expression features multidimensional $\vartheta -$functions (and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries is evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations proper of modular forms.
  We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the Bloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band inversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band structure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials models.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Study on Lithium Anode Interface Instability and Stabilization of Superionic Li3InCl6 and Li6PS5Cl Solid Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging superionic conductors Li3InCl6 (LIC) and Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) are very promising for solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, unstable lithium-anode interfaces in LIC and LPSC have been observed through experiments and ab initio calculations, while the interphases formed in determining interfacial stability remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the ab initio stability of LIC-Li and LPSC-Li interfaces and interphases. Our ab initio calculations revealed that both interfaces are not chemically or electrochemically thermodynamically stable. Interestingly, the LPSC-Li has a stable interphase, but the LIC-Li doesn't. Moreover, the interlayers were systematically evaluated for the LIC-Li and LPSC-Li interfaces, and the desired interlayer materials are clarified for the two interfaces. This ab initio understanding of the interfaces, interphases and interlayers would help the development of a variety of stable interfaces in ASSLBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a distinct class of antiferromagnets with electronic structures resembling those of d-wave superconductors, exhibit intriguing properties that have gained significant attention in recent research. In this article, we propose synthetic altermagnets, composed of two anisotropic ferromagnetic layers arranged such that the total net magnetization is zero. We investigate the properties of these synthetic altermagnets, focusing on their electronic band structures, spin current, Berry curvature, and anomalous Hall conductivity. By developing a minimal model for our synthetic altermagnets, we examine the influence of factors such as anisotropic coupling strengths and spin-orbit coupling on the physical phenomena altermagnets manifest. Our findings open a new path for the realization of altermagnetic materials experimentally and highlight their potential applications in magneto-electronics, magneto-optics, and spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling exciton formation: exploring the early stages in time, energy and momentum domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving the early-stage dynamics of exciton formation following non-resonant photoexcitation in time, energy, and momentum is quite challenging due to their inherently fast timescales and the proximity of the excitonic state to the bottom of the conduction band. In this study, by combining time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with \mathit{ab initio} numerical simulations, we capture the timing of the early-stage exciton dynamics in energy and momentum, starting from the photoexcited population in the conduction band, progressing through the formation of free excitons, and ultimately leading to their trapping in lattice deformations. The chosen material is bismuth tri-iodide ($BiI_3$), a layered semiconductor with a rich landscape of excitons in the electronic structure both in bulk and in monolayer form. The obtained results, providing a full characterization of the exciton formation, elucidate the early stages of the physical phenomena underlying the operation of the ultrafast semiconductor device.</description>

      <title>Ion exchange synthesizes layered polymorphs of MgZrN$_2$ and MgHfN$_2$, two metastable semiconductors</title>

Abstract: The synthesis of ternary nitrides is uniquely difficult, in large part because elemental N$_2$ is relatively inert. However, lithium reacts readily with other metals and N$_2$, making Li-M-N the most numerous sub-set of ternary nitrides. Here, we use Li$_2$ZrN$_2$, a ternary with a simple synthesis recipe, as a precursor for ion exchange reactions towards AZrN$_2$ (A = Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn). In situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction studies show that Li$^+$ and Mg$^{2+}$ undergo ion exchange topochemically, preserving the layers of octahedral [ZrN$_6$] to yield a metastable layered polymorph of MgZrN$_2$ (spacegroup $R\overline{3}m$) rather than the calculated ground state structure ($I41/amd$). UV-vis measurements show an optical absorption onset near 2.0 eV, consistent with the calculated bandgap for this polymorph. Our experimental attempts to extend this ion exchange method towards FeZrN$_2$, CuZrN$_2$, and ZnZrN$_2$ resulted in decomposition products (A + ZrN + 1/6 N$_2$), an outcome that our computational results explain via the higher metastability of these phases. We successfully extended this ion exchange method to other Li-M-N precursors by synthesizing MgHfN$_2$ from Li$_2$HfN$_2$. In addition to the discovery of metastable $R\overline{3}m$ MgZrN$_2$ and MgHfN$_2$, this work highlights the potential of the 63 unique Li-M-N phases as precursors to synthesize new ternary nitrides.</description>

      <title>Understanding process-structure-property relation for elastoplastic behavior of polymer nanocomposites with agglomeration anomalies and gradient interphase percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For polymer nanocomposites disordered microstructural nature makes processing control and hence tailoring properties to desired values a challenge. Understanding process-structure-property relation can provide guidelines for process and constituents design. Our work explores nuances of PSP relation for polymer nanocomposites with attractive pairing between particles and polymer bulk. Past works have shown that particle functionalization can help tweak these interactions in attractive or repulsive directions and can produce slow or fast decay of stiffness properties in polymer nanocomposites. In absence of any nano or micro-scale local property measurement, we develop a material model that can represent decay for small strain elastoplastic properties in interfacial regions and simulate representative or statistical volume element behavior. The interfacial elastoplastic material model is devised by combining local stiffness and glass transition measurements that were obtained by previous researchers by atomic force microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. This is further combined with a microstructural design of experiments for agglomerated nanocomposite systems. Agglomerations are particle aggregations that are processing artefacts that result from lack of processing control. Twin screw extrusion process can reduce extent of aggregation in hot pressed samples via erosion or rupture depending on screw rpms and toque. We connect this process-structure relation to structure-property relation that emerges from our study. We discover that balancing between local stress concentration zone and interfacial property decay governs how fast yield stress can improve if we break down agglomeration via erosion. Rupture is relatively less effective in helping improve nanocomposite yield strength.</description>

      <title>Designing Optically Addressable Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Ultra-Small Nanodiamonds: Insights from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasmall nanodiamonds (USNDs) are promising platforms for fluorescent and quantum sensing applications. Here we present first-principles electronic structure calculations of color centers in USNDs, specifically the nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) and we investigate their optical addressability as a function of the surface termination. We consider both isolated nanoparticles and arrays of USNDs with different degrees of packing, and we include quantum vibronic effects in our analysis, using stochastic methods. We find that the NV in USNDs can be stabilized in a negative charge state if the nanoparticles are terminated by fluorine, hydroxyl, and ether. While fluorine terminations can be used for fluorescent bio-tags, we suggest that hydroxyl and ether terminations are beneficial for quantum sensing applications. We also find that the NV- can be stabilized in arrays of USNDs when inter-particle separations are larger than the diameter of the nanoparticle. Interestingly, the phonon renormalizations of single-particle energy levels found in arrays contribute to the charge stability of negatively charged NV centers.</description>

      <title>Cutting Soft Matter: Scaling relations controlled by toughness, friction, and wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cutting mechanics of soft solids is gaining rapid attention thanks to its promising benefits in material characterization and other applications. However, a full understanding of the physical phenomena is still missing, and several questions remain outstanding. E.g.: How can we directly and reliably measure toughness from cutting experiments? What is the role of blade sharpness? In this paper, we explore the simple problem of wire cutting, where blade sharpness is only defined by the wire radius. Through finite element analysis, we obtain a simple scaling relation between the wire radius and the steady-state cutting force per unit sample thickness. The cutting force is independent of the wire radius if the latter is below a transition length, while larger radii produce a linear force-radius correlation. The minimum cutting force, for small radii, is given by cleavage toughness, i.e., the surface energy required to break covalent bonds in the crack plane. The force-radius slope is instead given by the wear shear strength in the material. Via cutting experiments on polyacrylamide gels, we find that the magnitude of shear strength is close to the work of fracture of the material, i.e., the critical strain energy density required to break a pristine sample in uniaxial tension. The work of fracture characterizes the toughening contribution from the fracture process zone (FPZ), which adds to cleavage toughness. Our study provides two important messages, that answer the above questions: Toughness can be estimated from wire-cutting experiments from the intercept of the force-radius linear correlation, as previously explored. However, as we discovered, this only estimates cleavage toughness. Additionally, the force-radius slope is correlated with the work of fracture, giving an estimation of the dissipative contributions from the FPZ.</description>

      <title>Experimental electronic phase diagram in a diamond-lattice antiferromagnetic system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report Ni-doping effect on the magnetic and electronic properties of thiospinel Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$[Co$_{0.3}$Ir$_{1.7}$]S$_4$ (0 $\leq x \leq$ 1). The parent compound Co[Co$_{0.3}$Ir$_{1.7}$]S$_4$ exhibits antiferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{N} \sim$ 292 K within the $A$-site diamond sublattice, along with a narrow charge-transfer gap. Upon Ni doping, an insulator-to-metal crossover occurs at $x \sim$ 0.35, and the antiferromagnetism is gradually suppressed, with $T_\mathrm{N}$ decreasing to 23 K at $x =$ 0.7. In the metallic state, a spin-glass-like transition emerges at low temperatures. The antiferromagnetic transition is completely suppressed at $x_\mathrm{c} \sim$ 0.95, around which a non-Fermi-liquid behavior emerges, evident from the $T^\alpha$ temperature dependence with $\alpha \approx$ 1.2-1.3 in resistivity and divergent behavior of $C/T$ in specific heat at low temperatures. Meanwhile, the electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ increases substantially, signifying an enhancement of the quasiparticle effective mass. The magnetic phase diagram has been established, in which an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point is avoided at $x_\mathrm{c}$. Conversely, the observed glass-like tail above the critical concentration aligns more closely with theoretical predictions for an extended region of quantum Griffiths phase in the presence of strong disorder.</description>

      <title>Dry Transfer Based on PMMA and Thermal Release Tape for Heterogeneous Integration of 2D-TMDC Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable and scalable transfer of 2D-TMDCs (two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides) from the growth substrate to a target substrate with high reproducibility and yield is a crucial step for device integration. In this work, we have introduced a scalable dry-transfer approach for 2D-TMDCs grown by MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition) on sapphire. Transfer to a silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO$_2$) substrate is performed using PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) and TRT (thermal release tape) as sacrificial layer and carrier, respectively. Our proposed method ensures a reproducible peel-off from the growth substrate and better preservation of the 2D-TMDC during PMMA removal in solvent, without compromising its adhesion to the target substrate. A comprehensive comparison between the dry method introduced in this work and a standard wet transfer based on potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution shows improvement in terms of cleanliness and structural integrity for dry-transferred layer, as evidenced by X-ray photoemission and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. Moreover, fabricated field-effect transistors (FETs) demonstrate improvements in subthreshold slope, maximum drain current and device-to-device variability. The dry-transfer method developed in this work enables large-area integration of 2D-TMDC layers into (opto)electronic components with high reproducibility, while better preserving the as-grown properties of the layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current-induced out of plane magnetization has been utilized for field-free switching of ferromagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Identifying systems capable of energy-efficiently converting charge currents into out of plane orbit- or spin-polarized currents is crucial for advancing magnetic memory technologies. Here we introduce the Berry curvature dipole as a key evaluation factor, directly measurable through nonlinear Hall effects. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 used in our experiments, applying a current parallel to the Berry curvature dipole results in out of plane orbital magnetization, which governs the field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in TaIrTe4/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructures. Notably, all-electric control of van der Waals magnetoresistive memory at room temperature has been achieved with a low critical current density 2x10^6A/cm2 for data writing. Our findings reveal the connection between nonlinear Hall effects and field-free magnetization switching, highlighting the potential of the Berry curvature dipole in advancing orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Facilitating field-free perpendicular magnetization switching with a Berry curvature dipole in a Weyl semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the synergy between orbital and spin-orbit torques in WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 heterostructures characterized by a Berry curvature dipole. By applying a current along the a axis in WTe2, we detect an out-of-plane magnetization in the system, which we attribute to nonequilibrium orbital magnetization linked to the Berry curvature dipole based on first-principles calculations, manifesting as the orbital Edelstein effect. This effect generates orbital torques that enable field-free perpendicular magnetization switching. Furthermore, by applying a relatively small current along the a axis and a pulsed current along the b axis in WTe2, we demonstrate controllable field-free magnetization switching of the adjacent Fe3GeTe2 layer, independently manipulating the orbital and spin-orbit torques. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of the collaborative dynamics between these torques but also suggest potential applications in magnetoresistive random-access memory.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Weakly Confined CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization could significantly advance ultrafast time-of-flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, we demonstrate that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. We show that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non-radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420 ps lifetime and light yield of ~10'000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non-radiative losses. Temperature-dependent light-guiding experiments on test-bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light-transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band-edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotech scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents a micromechanical representation of deformation in 2D granular materials. The representation is a generalization of K. Bagi's work and is based upon the void-cell approach of M. Satake. The general representation applies to a material region partitioned into polygonal subregions. This representation possesses a certain consistency that allows for a unique assignment of the contribution that each contact displacement makes to the average deformation of an assembly. The paper addresses construction of the particle graph and appropriate data structures for use with the Discrete Element Method. The approach is applied in a numerical simulation of a two-dimensional assembly of disks. The author presents results of the distributions of deformation and particle-group rotation, with a resolution of about a single particle diameter. Deformation was very nonuniform, even at low strains. Micro-bands, thin linear zones of intense rotation, were also observed.</description>

Abstract: Previous symmetry-based database searches have already revealed ubiquitous band topology in nature, while the destiny of band topology under symmetry-breaking is yet to be studied comprehensively. Here we first develop a framework allowing systematically ascertaining topological state evolution as expressed via a tree-like graph for magnetic/non-magnetic crystalline material belonging to any of the 1651 magnetic space groups. Interestingly, we find that specifying different ways of realizing symmetry-breaking leads to various contractions of the tree-like graph, as a new angle of comprehensively characterizing the correlation between a spontaneous symmetry-breaking and any symmetry-group-indicated physics consequence. We also perform a high-throughput investigation on the 1267 stoichiometric magnetic materials ever-experimentally synthesized to reveal a hierarchy of topological states along all continuous paths of symmetry-breaking (preserving the translation symmetry) from the parent magnetic space group to P1. The results in this work are expected to aid experimentalists in selecting feasible and appropriate means to tune band topology towards realistic applications and promote further studies on using tree-like graph to explore the interconnection between topology and other intriguing orderings.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Boron Nitride as an Ultrathin Copper Diffusion Barrier for Advanced Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on amorphous boron nitride ($\rm \alpha$-BN) as a novel diffusion barrier for advanced semiconductor technology, particularly addressing the critical challenge of copper diffusion in back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnects. Owing to its ultralow dielectric constant and robust barrier properties, $\rm \alpha$-BN is examined as an alternative to conventional low-k dielectrics. The investigation primarily employs theoretical modeling, using a Gaussian Approximation Potential, to simulate and understand the atomic-level interactions. This machine learning-based approach allows the performance of realistic simulations of amorphous structure of $\rm \alpha$-BN, enabling the exploration of the impact of different film morphologies on barrier efficacy. Furthermore, we studied the electronic and optical properties of the films using a simple Tight-Binding model. In addition to the theoretical studies, we performed diffusion studies of copper through PECVD $\rm \alpha$-BN on Si. The results from both the theoretical and experimental investigations highlight the potential of $\rm \alpha$-BN as a highly effective diffusion barrier, suitable for integration in nanoelectronics. This research shows that $\rm \alpha$-BN is a promising candidate for BEOL interconnects but also demonstrates the synergy of advanced computational models and experimental methods in material innovation for semiconductor applications.</description>

Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is a powerful theoretical approach that is capable to accurately treat electron-hole interactions in materials in an excited state. We developed an ab initio framework based on the BSE to describe a pump-probe experiment, in which an x-ray pulse probes solid-state valence excitons by means of x-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our theoretical framework is of relevance for an accurate modeling of pump-probe experiments of photo-excited materials that utilize novel capabilities offered by x-ray science.</description>

      <title>Interpolation and differentiation of alchemical degrees of freedom in machine learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a workhorse of modern atomistic simulations, and recently published universal MLIPs, pre-trained on large datasets, have demonstrated remarkable accuracy and generalizability. However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. With this modification, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties, characterizing order and disorder in multicomponent oxides, and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stability of complex materials systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials is crucial for their potential applications in nano- and optoelectronics. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as WS$_2$ have garnered significant interest due to their strong light-matter interaction and extreme sensitivity of the band structure to the presence of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. In this study, we investigate the transient electronic structure of monolayer WS$_2$ on a graphene substrate after resonant excitation of the A-exciton using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a pronounced band structure renormalization including a substantial reduction of the transient band gap that is in good quantitative agreement with our {\it ab initio} theory that reveals the importance of both intrinsic WS$_2$ and extrinsic substrate contributions to the transient band structure of monolayer WS$_2$. Our findings not only deepen the fundamental understanding of band structure dynamics in two-dimensional materials but also offer valuable insights for the development of novel electronic and optoelectronic devices based on monolayer TMDs and their heterostructures with graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternative magnetic materials or ``altermagnets", characterized by their non-relativistic, momentum-dependent spin-split states, represent a cutting-edge advancement in the field of magnetism, offering promising avenues for spintronic applications. Among these materials, hexagonal MnTe has emerged as a standout material candidate for its substantial spin-splitting. In this study, employing first-principles electronic structure calculations and spin group symmetry analysis, we delve into the interplay of altermagnetism and pressure in two main phases of MnTe. Our relativistic calculations demonstrate the presence of tunable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in hexagonal MnTe. In addition, our results underscore the pivotal role of pressure as a tuning parameter for the alternative magnetic traits in the system. Furthermore, we identify another phase of MnTe with orthorhombic structure, namely $\gamma$-MnTe, hosting altermagnetic characteristics. We study, in detail, its response in AHE and spin-spliting due to magnetization and pressure variations, respectively. Our study highlights the substantial impact of pressure on the properties of alternative magnetic materials, particularly emphasizing the pronounced tuning effect observed in the hexagonal and orthorhombic MnTe.</description>

      <title>Strain-driven stabilization of a room-temperature chiral multiferroic with coupled ferroaxial and ferroelectric order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncollinear ferroic materials are sought after as testbeds to explore the intimate connections between topology and symmetry, which result in electronic, optical and magnetic functionalities not observed in collinear ferroic materials. For example, ferroaxial materials have ordered rotational structural distortions that break mirror symmetry and induce chirality. When ferroaxial order is coupled with ferroelectricity arising from a broken inversion symmetry, it offers the prospect of electric-field-control of the ferroaxial distortions and opens up new tunable functionalities. However, chiral multiferroics, especially ones stable at room temperature, are rare. We report the discovery of a strain-stabilized, room-temperature chiral multiferroic phase in single crystals of BaTiS$_3$, a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) hexagonal chalcogenide. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the stabilization of this multiferroic phase having $P6_3$ space group for biaxial tensile strains exceeding 1.5% applied on the basal ab-plane of the room temperature $P6_3cm$ phase of BaTiS$_3$. The chiral multiferroic phase is characterized by rotational distortions of select TiS$_6$ octahedra around the long $c$-axis and polar displacement of Ti atoms along the $c$-axis. We used an innovative approach using focused ion beam milling to make appropriately strained samples of BaTiS$_3$. The ferroaxial and ferroelectric distortions, and their domains in $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ were directly resolved using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Landau-based phenomenological modeling predicts a strong coupling between the ferroelectric and the ferroaxial order making $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ an attractive test bed for achieving electric-field control of chirality-related phenomena such as circular photo-galvanic current and the Rashba effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a promising technique to functionalize particle surfaces for energy applications including energy storage, catalysis, and decarbonization. In this work, we present a set of models of ALD particle coating to explore the transition from lab scale to manufacturing. Our models encompass the main particle coating manufacturing approaches including rotary bed, fluidized bed, and continuously vibrating reactors. These models provide key metrics, such as throughput and precursor utilization, required to evaluate the scalability of ALD manufacturing approaches and their feasibility in the context of energy applications. Our results show that designs that force the precursor to flow through fluidized particles transition faster to a transport-limited regime where throughput is maximized. They also exhibit higher precursor utilization. In the context of continuous processes, our models indicate that it is possible to achieve self-extinguishing processes with almost 100% precursor utilization. A comparison with past experimental results of ALD in fluidized bed reactors shows excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals on Dependence of Volume on Pressure and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The common wisdom that volume decreases with pressure and increases with temperature is analyzed in terms of Hillert nonequilibrium thermodynamics in the present work. It is shown that the derivative of volume to pressure in a stable system is always negative, i.e., volume decreases with the increase of pressure, when all other natural variables of the system are kept constant. This originates from the stability requirement that the conjugate variables, such as volume and negative pressure, must change in the same direction in a stable system. Consequently, since volume and temperature are not conjugate variables, they do not have to change in the same direction and thus do change in opposite directions in both natural and man-made systems. It is shown that the decrease of volume with the increase of temperature, commonly referred as negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the literature, originates from the statistical competitions of configurations in the system when the volumes of metastable configurations are smaller than that of the ground-state configuration. It is demonstrated that the zentropy theory can concisely explain and accurately predict NTE based on the density functional theory without fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Low temperature state in strontium titanate microcrystals using in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heatmaps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Accelerated Simulation of Atomic Transport in Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sn-based perovskites as low-toxic materials are actively studied for optoelectronic applications. However, their performance is limited by $p$-type self-doping, which can be suppressed by substitutional doping on the cation sites. In this study, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning (ML) to develop a predictive model and identify the key descriptors affecting formation energy and charge transition levels of the substitutional dopants in CsSnI$_{3}$. Our DFT calculations create a dataset of formation energies and charge transition levels and show that Y, Sc, Al, Nb, Ba, and Sr are effective dopants that pin the fermi level higher in the band gap, suppressing the $p$-type self-doping. We explore ML algorithms and propose training the random forest regression model to predict the defect formation properties. This work shows the predictive capability of combining DFT with machine learning and provides insights into the important features that determine the defect formation energetics.</description>

      <title>Continuous Collapse of the Spin Cycloid in BiFeO3 Thin Films under an Applied Magnetic Field probed by Neutron Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is one of the rare materials that exhibits multiferroic properties already at room-temperature. Therefore, it offers tremendous potential for future technological applications, such as memory and logic. However, a weak magnetoelectric coupling together with the presence of a noncollinear cycloidal spin order restricts various practical applications of BiFeO3. Therefore, there is a large interest in the search for suitable methods for the modulation of the spin cycloid in BiFeO3. By performing neutron diffraction experiments using a triple-axis instrument we have determined that the spin cycloid can be systematically suppressed by applying a high magnetic field of 10 T in a BiFeO3 thin film of about 100 nm grown on a (110)-oriented SrTiO3 substrate. As predicted by previous theoretical calculations, we observed that the required critical magnetic field to suppress the spin cycloid in a BiFeO3 thin film was lower as compared to the previously reported critical magnetic field for bulk BiFeO3 single crystals. Our experiment reveals that the spin cycloid continuously expands with increasing magnetic field before the complete transformation into a G-type antiferromagnetic spin order. Such tuning of the length of the spin cycloid up to a complete suppression offers new functionalities for future technological applications as in spintronics or magnonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant attention in recent years as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their low cost, abundant sodium resources, and excellent cycling performance. Hard carbon materials, characterized by their high specific capacity, outstanding cycling stability, and low cost, have emerged as potential candidates for SIB anodes. However, the sodium storage mechanism in hard carbon anodes remains highly complex, especially in disordered structures, and is yet to be fully understood. To address this, we employed relative machine learning force fields (MLFFs) in conjunction with multiscale simulation techniques to systematically investigate the sodium storage behavior in hard carbon. By integrating simulations, this study provides a detailed exploration of sodium adsorption, intercalation, and filling mechanisms. High-precision, large-scale simulations reveal the dynamic behavior and distribution patterns of sodium ions in hard carbon. The findings not only deepen our understanding of sodium storage mechanisms in hard carbon anodes, but also offer a theoretical foundation for optimizing future SIB designs, while introducing novel simulation methodologies and technical frameworks to enhance battery performance.</description>

Abstract: Gallenene is a promising low-dimensional material with a structure down to the thickness of a single atom, similar to graphene. However, van der Waals stacking of two-dimensional (2D) gallenene under confinement remain poorly understood. In this study, we present evidence of the formation of parallel-stacked hexagonal gallenene (a100) structures in liquid gallium. The present study demonstrates the AB stacking of 2D gallenene a100 crystals in liquid gallium sandwiched between two graphene layers, as observed through transmission electron microscopy. A nonlinear optical response of the confined hexagonal gallenene was investigated through second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The SHG signal exhibits periodic peak intensity shifts upon angular rotation up to 90 degrees and intensity dampening at elevated temperatures. These findings offer insights on device applications of 2D gallenene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the optical properties of color centers in silicon carbide is essential for their use in quantum technologies, such as single-photon emission and spin-based qubits. In this work, first-principles calculations were employed using the r2SCAN density functional to investigate the electronic and vibrational properties of neutral divacancy configurations in 4H-SiC. Our approach addresses the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect in the excited states of axial divacancies. By explicitly solving the multimode dynamical Jahn-Teller problem, we compute emission and absorption lineshapes for axial divacancy configurations, providing insights into the complex interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. The results show strong alignment with experimental data, underscoring the predictive power of the methodologies. Our calculations predict spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in the excited state of the $kh$ divacancy, accompanied by the lowest electron-phonon coupling among the four configurations and distinct polarizability. These unique properties facilitate its selective excitation, setting it apart from other divacancy configurations, and highlight its potential utility in quantum technology applications. These findings underscore the critical role of electron-phonon interactions and optical properties in spin defects with pronounced Jahn-Teller effects, offering valuable insights for the design and integration of quantum emitters for quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions is a key issue in the development and application of high-energy density materials (HEDMs). Herein, a two-dimensional double-layer interlocked Li4(N5)2 nitrogen-rich compound crystals, in which the two N5 rings are locked to by sharing four Li atoms, was found to maintain structural stability at zero pressure conditions. Dynamics studies reliably confirm crystal stability below 250 K. Furthermore, the stability of Li4(N5)2 crystal mainly arises from the ionic interaction between Li atoms and N5 rings, formed by the charge transfer from Li atoms to N5 rings. This study highlights the feasibility of stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions, paving the way for atomic level advancements in HEDMs.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium carrier dynamics and band structure of graphene on 2D tin</title>

Abstract: Intercalation of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with Sn results in a well-ordered Sn $(1\times1)$ structure on the SiC surface with quasi-freestanding graphene on top. While the electronic properties of the individual layers have been studied in the past, emerging phenomena arising from possible inter-layer interactions between the 2D\,Sn layer and graphene remain unexplored. We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal a surprisingly short-lived non-equilibrium carrier distribution inside the Dirac cone of Sn-intercalated graphene. Further, we find that the graphene $\pi$-band exhibits a transient increase in binding energy that we attribute to charging of the graphene layer with holes. We interpret our results with support from density functional theory calculations of the graphene - 2D\,Sn heterostructure that reveal a substantial hybridization between the graphene $\pi$-bands and Sn states, providing a channel for efficient ultrafast charge transfer between the layers. Our results on the graphene - 2D\,Sn model system are expected to trigger similar investigations on related heterostructures obtained by intercalation of epitaxial graphene. Regarding the huge choice of materials that have been successfully intercalated in the past, we believe that the interlayer interactions revealed in the present work only represent the tip of the iceberg with many fascinating emerging phenomena to be discovered in the near future.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical materials with interconnected pores from capillary suspensions for bone tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for bone grafts due to the aging population has opened new opportunities for the manufacture of porous ceramics to assist in bone reconstruction. In our study, we investigate a new, promising method to manufacture hierarchically porous structures in a straightforward, and tuneable way. It consists of combining the novel technology of capillary suspensions, formed by mixing solid particles and two immiscible liquids, one less than 5 vol%, with freeze casting. We have successfully achieved alumina and $\beta$-TCP materials with both &lt;2 $\mu$m and 20-50 $\mu$m as the smallest and largest pore size, respectively. The microstructure exhibits fully open pores and high levels of porosity (&gt;60%). The capillary suspensions' rheological behaviour indicates that silica nano-suspensions as a secondary fluid creates a stronger internal particle network than sucrose for the alumina system. Conversely, the opposite was observed with the $\beta$-TCP system. These differences were attributed to the change in affinity between the secondary fluids and the solid loading. Our study, both systems has served to deepen the knowledge about the new area of capillary suspensions and proves their use in hierarchical porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Rare-Earth Chalcogenides: An Inspiring Playground For Exploring Frustrated Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rare-earth chalcogenide $ARECh_{2}$ family ($A =$ alkali metal or monovalent ions, $RE =$ rare earth, $Ch =$ chalcogen) has emerged as a paradigmatic platform for studying frustrated magnetism on a triangular lattice. The family members exhibit a variety of ground states, from quantum spin liquid to exotic ordered phases, providing fascinating insight into quantum magnetism. Their simple crystal structure and chemical tunability enable systematic exploration of competing interactions in quantum magnets. Recent neutron scattering and thermodynamic studies have revealed rich phase diagrams and unusual excitations, refining theoretical models of frustrated systems. This review provides a succinct introduction to $ARECh_{2}$ research. It summarizes key findings on crystal structures, single-ion physics, magnetic Hamiltonians, ground states, and low-energy excitations. By highlighting current developments and open questions, we aim to catalyze further exploration and deeper physical understanding on this frontier of quantum magnetism.</description>
