      <title>Complete equational theories for classical and quantum Gaussian relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give generators and relations for the hypergraph props of Gaussian relations and positive affine Lagrangian relations. The former extends Gaussian probabilistic processes by completely-uninformative priors, and the latter extends Gaussian quantum mechanics with infinitely-squeezed states. These presentations are given by adding a generator to the presentation of real affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations.
  The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states with a representation for Gaussian transformations. We interpret the LOv-calculus, a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about passive linear-optical quantum circuits in our presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations. Moreover, we show how our presentation allows for additional optical operations such as active squeezing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I humbly introduce a concept I call "Fregean flows," a graph theoretic representation of classical logic, to show how higher-dimensional graph characteristics might be useful to prove or perhaps at best show the provability of simple deductive statements typically represented as one-dimensional strings of characters. I apply these to a very simple proof, namely proving the equivalence of two definitions for an Abelian group G, an if-and-only-if statement, using a re-representation of statements as vertices and both conjunctions and implications as differently coloured edges. This re-representation of an if-and-only-if is simple but shows unexpected geometry, and I discuss its possible utility in terms of provability through ideas of graph topology, similarities of graph contraction to deductive elimination, and recursion.</description>

      <title>Meta Operator for Complex Query Answering on Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs contain informative factual knowledge but are considered incomplete. To answer complex queries under incomplete knowledge, learning-based Complex Query Answering (CQA) models are proposed to directly learn from the query-answer samples to avoid the direct traversal of incomplete graph data. Existing works formulate the training of complex query answering models as multi-task learning and require a large number of training samples. In this work, we explore the compositional structure of complex queries and argue that the different logical operator types, rather than the different complex query types, are the key to improving generalizability. Accordingly, we propose a meta-learning algorithm to learn the meta-operators with limited data and adapt them to different instances of operators under various complex queries. Empirical results show that learning meta-operators is more effective than learning original CQA or meta-CQA models.</description>

      <title>NLP Verification: Towards a General Methodology for Certifying Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited substantial success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and ensuring their safety and reliability is crucial: there are safety critical contexts where such models must be robust to variability or attack, and give guarantees over their output. Unlike Computer Vision, NLP lacks a unified verification methodology and, despite recent advancements in literature, they are often light on the pragmatical issues of NLP verification. In this paper, we make an attempt to distil and evaluate general components of an NLP verification pipeline, that emerges from the progress in the field to date. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we give a general characterisation of verifiable subspaces that result from embedding sentences into continuous spaces. We identify, and give an effective method to deal with, the technical challenge of semantic generalisability of verified subspaces; and propose it as a standard metric in the NLP verification pipelines (alongside with the standard metrics of model accuracy and model verifiability). Secondly, we propose a general methodology to analyse the effect of the embedding gap, a problem that refers to the discrepancy between verification of geometric subpspaces on the one hand, and semantic meaning of sentences which the geometric subspaces are supposed to represent, on the other hand. In extreme cases, poor choices in embedding of sentences may invalidate verification results. We propose a number of practical NLP methods that can help to identify the effects of the embedding gap; and in particular we propose the metric of falsifiability of semantic subpspaces as another fundamental metric to be reported as part of the NLP verification pipeline. We believe that together these general principles pave the way towards a more consolidated and effective development of this new domain.</description>

      <title>Scaling Game-Theoretic Security Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the CheckMate tool for automated verification of game-theoretic security properties, with application to blockchain protocols. CheckMate applies automated reasoning techniques to determine whether a game-theoretic protocol model is game-theoretically secure, that is, Byzantine fault tolerant and incentive compatible. We describe CheckMate's input format and its various components, modes, and output. CheckMate is evaluated on 14 benchmarks, including models of decentralized protocols, board games, and game-theoretic examples.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>

      <title>Universal Algebra in UniMath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.05952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our library for Universal Algebra in the UniMath framework dealing with multi-sorted signatures, their algebras, and the basics for equation systems. We show how to implement term algebras over a signature without resorting to general inductive constructions (currently not allowed in UniMath) still retaining the computational nature of the definition. We prove that our single sorted ground term algebras are instances of homotopy W-types. From this perspective, the library enriches UniMath with a computationally well-behaved implementation of a class of W-types. Moreover, we give neat constructions of the univalent categories of algebras and equational algebras by using the formalism of displayed categories, and show that the term algebra over a signature is the initial object of the category of algebras. Finally, we showcase the computational relevance of our work by sketching some basic examples from algebra and propositional logic.</description>

      <title>Place Bisimilarity is Decidable, Indeed!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.01392v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Place bisimilarity $\sim_p$ is a behavioral equivalence for finite Petri nets, originally proposed in \cite{ABS91}, that, differently from all the other behavioral relations proposed so far, is not defined over the markings of a finite net, rather over its places, which are finitely many. Place bisimilarity $\sim_p$ was claimed decidable in \cite{ABS91}, but its decidability was not really proved. We show that it is possible to decide $\sim_p$ with a simple algorithm, which essentially scans all the place relations (which are finitely many) to check whether they are place bisimulations. We also show that $\sim_p$ does respect the intended causal semantics of Petri nets, as it is finer than causal-net bisimilarity \cite{Gor22}. Moreover, we propose a slightly coarser variant, we call d-place bisimilarity $\sim_d$, that we conjecture to be the coarsest equivalence, fully respecting causality and branching time (as it is finer than fully-concurrent bisimilarity \cite{BDKP91}), to be decidable on finite Petri nets. Finally, two even coarser variants are discussed, namely i-place and i-d-place bisimilarities, which are still decidable, do preserve the concurrent behavior of Petri nets, but do not respect causality. These results open the way towards formal verification (by equivalence checking) of distributed systems modeled by finite Petri nets.</description>

      <title>Executable First-Order Queries in the Logic of Information Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00240v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logic of information flows (LIF) has recently been proposed as a general framework in the field of knowledge representation. In this framework, tasks of procedural nature can still be modeled in a declarative, logic-based fashion. In this paper, we focus on the task of query processing under limited access patterns, a well-studied problem in the database literature. We show that LIF is well-suited for modeling this task. Toward this goal, we introduce a variant of LIF called "forward" LIF (FLIF), in a first-order setting. FLIF takes a novel graph-navigational approach; it is an XPath-like language that nevertheless turns out to be equivalent to the "executable" fragment of first-order logic defined by Nash and Lud\"ascher. One can also classify the variables in FLIF expressions as inputs and outputs. Expressions where inputs and outputs are disjoint, referred to as io-disjoint FLIF expressions, allow a particularly transparent translation into algebraic query plans that respect the access limitations. Finally, we show that general FLIF expressions can always be put into io-disjoint form.</description>

      <title>Constructive S4 modal logics with the finite birelational frame property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logics $\mathsf{CS4}$ and $\mathsf{IS4}$ are the two leading intuitionistic variants of the modal logic $\mathsf{S4}$. Whether the finite model property holds for each of these logics have been long-standing open problems. It was recently shown that $\mathsf{IS4}$ has the finite frame property and thus the finite model property. In this paper, we prove that $\mathsf{CS4}$ also enjoys the finite frame property.
  Additionally, we investigate the following three logics closely related to $\mathsf{IS4}$. The logic $\mathsf{GS4}$ is obtained by adding the G\"odel--Dummett axiom to $\mathsf{IS4}$; it is both a superintuitionistic and a fuzzy logic and has previously been given a real-valued semantics. We provide an alternative birelational semantics and prove strong completeness with respect to this semantics. The extension $\mathsf{GS4^c}$ of $\mathsf{GS4}$ corresponds to requiring a crisp accessibility relation on the real-valued semantics. We give a birelational semantics corresponding to an extra confluence condition on the $\mathsf{GS4}$ birelational semantics and prove strong completeness. Neither of these two logics have the finite model property with respect to their real-valued semantics, but we prove that they have the finite frame property for their birelational semantics. Establishing the finite birelational frame property immediately establishes decidability, which was previously open for these two logics. Our proofs yield NEXPTIME upper bounds. The logic $\mathsf{S4I}$ is obtained from $\mathsf{IS4}$ by reversing the roles of the modal and intuitionistic relations in the birelational semantics. We also prove the finite frame property, and thereby decidability, for $\mathsf{S4I}$</description>
