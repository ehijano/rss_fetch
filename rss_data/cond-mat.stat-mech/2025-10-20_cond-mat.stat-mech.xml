      <title>A unified framework for divergences, free energies, and Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many efforts have been made to explore systems that show significant deviations from predictions related to the standard statistical mechanics. The present work introduces a unified formalism that connects divergences, generalized free energies, generalized Fokker-Planck equations, and H-theorem. This framework is applied here in a range of scenarios, illustrating both established and novel results. In many cases, the approach begins with a free energy functional that explicitly includes a potential energy term, leading to a direct relation between this energy and the stationary solution. Conversely, when a divergence is used as free energy, the associated Fokker-Planck-like equation lacks any explicit dependence on the potential energy, depending instead on the stationary solution. To restore a potential-based interpretation, an additional relation between the stationary solution and the potential energy must be imposed. This duality underlines the flexibility of the formalism and its capacity to adapt to systems where the potential energy is unknown or unnecessary.</description>

      <title>Automatic Refinement of Force Fields Based on Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact characterization of phase transitions requires sufficient configurational sampling, necessitating efficient and accurate potential energy surfaces. Molecular force fields with computational efficiency and physical interpretability are desirable but challenging to refine for complex interactions. To address this, we propose a force field refinement strategy with phase diagrams as top-down optimization targets based on automatic differentiation. Using gas-liquid co-existence as a paradigm, we employ an enhanced sampling technique and design a differentiable loss function to evaluate force fields' depiction of phase diagrams. The refined force fields produce gas-liquid phase diagrams matching well with targets for two modeling systems, which confirms our approach as an effective automated force field development framework for phase transition studies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of the first positive position reached by a random walker starting at the origin is central to the analysis of extremes and records in one-dimensional random walks. In this work, we present a detailed and self-contained analytical study of this distribution for symmetric finite-range lattice walks, whose steps are drawn from a distribution supported on finitely many integers.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of hydrodynamics in a one-dimensional cold gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following model is studied analytically and numerically: point particles with masses $m,\mu,m, \dots$ ($m\geq\mu$) are distributed over the positive half-axis. Their dynamics is initiated by giving a positive velocity to the particle located at the origin; in its course the particles undergo elastic collisions. We show that, for certain values of $m/\mu$, starting from the initial state where the particles are equidistant the system evolves in a hydrodynamic way: (i) the rightmost particle (blast front) moves as $t^{\delta}$ with $\delta &lt; 1$; (ii) recoiled particles behind the front enter the negative half-axis; (iii) the splatter -- the particles with locations $x\leq 0$ -- moves in the ballistic way and eventually takes over the whole energy of the system. These results agree with those obtained in S. Chakraborti et al, SciPost Phys. 2022, 13, 074, for $m/\mu=2$ and random initial particle positions. At the same time, we explicitly found the collection of positive numbers $\{\mathcal{M}_i, i \in \mathbf{N} \}$ such that, for $m/\mu = \mathcal{M}_i$, $i\leq 700$, the following holds: (a) the splatter is absent; (b) the number of simultaneously moving particles is at most three; (c) the blast front moves in the ballistic way. However, if, similarly as in S. Chakraborti et al, the particle positions are sampled from a uniformly distributed ensemble, for $m/\mu = \mathcal{M}_i$ the system evolves in a hydrodynamic way.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic fluctuation-response theory and its use for gene regulatory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian macroscopic fluctuation theory underpins the understanding of noise in a broad class of nonequilibrium systems. We derive exact fluctuation-response relations linking the power spectral density of stationary fluctuations to the linear response of stable nonequilibrium steady states. Both of these can be determined experimentally and used to reconstruct the kernel of the linearized dynamics and the diffusion matrix, and thus any features of the Gaussian theory. We apply our theory to gene regulatory networks with negative feedback, and derive an explicit internal-external noise decomposition of the power spectral density for any networks, including cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on the lower bound of the length-scale critical exponent $\nu$ at continuous phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental issue in the renormalization-group (RG) theory of critical phenomena concerns the allowed values of critical exponents that are consistent with the continuous nature of a phase transition. Here we conjecture a lower bound for the length-scale exponent $\nu$ that should hold at continuous transitions associated with $d$-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) $\Phi^4$ theories with a multicomponent scalar field $\varphi_i$ (including some extensions with fermionic and gauge fields). If $\Delta_\varphi=(d-2+\eta)/2$ is the dimension of the order parameter -- $\varphi_i$ in LGW models -- and $\Delta_\varepsilon=d-1/\nu$ is the RG dimension of the energy operator $\varepsilon$, which can be identified with $[\sum_i \varphi_i^2]$ (the squared field with a proper subtraction of the mixing with the identity), we conjecture the inequality $\Delta_\varepsilon - 2 \Delta_\varphi\ge 0$, which implies $1/\nu \le 2-\eta$ and $\gamma = (2-\eta)\nu\ge 1$. These inequalities are supported by general arguments for lattice models, exact relations for two-dimensional minimal conformal field theories, and are consistent with all known (numerical, perturbative, and exact) results for LGW $\Phi^4$ theories. In particular, since unitarity requires $\eta\ge 0$, the above inequality implies $\nu\ge 1/2$ for unitary theories. This lower bound is more restrictive than the bound $\nu &gt; 1/d$, which is derived by noting that $\nu=1/d$ is the expected behavior at first-order transitions.</description>

      <title>deGennes-Suzuki-Kubo Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics: Applications to Quantum Hysteresis, Heat Engines and Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly review the early development of the mean-field dynamics for cooperatively interacting quantum many-body systems, mapped to pseudo-spin (Ising-like) systems. We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each of the components following Suzuki-Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field which provided us a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes-Suzuki-Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Laning Transitions in Pattern Forming Driven Binary Systems with Competing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A binary system of particles that move in opposite directions under an applied field can exhibit disordered states as well as laned states where the particles organize into oppositely moving high-mobility lanes to reduce collisions. Previous studies of laning transitions generally focused on particles with purely repulsive interactions. Here, we examine laning transitions for oppositely moving pattern-forming systems of particles with competing attractive and repulsive interactions, which in equilibrium form crystal, stripe, and bubble states. In addition to multiple types of laned states, we find jammed crystals, stripes, and bubbles, and generally observe a much richer variety of phases compared to the purely repulsive system. In the stripe forming regime, the system can dynamically reorder into oppositely moving stripes that are aligned in the direction of the drive. The bubble phase can produce strongly polarized jammed states of elongated bubbles where particles in the individual bubbles segregate to opposite sides of the bubbles. We also find disordered states, segregated laned bubble states where the bubbles pass each other in lanes, and segregated bubbles that move through one another. In the compact bubble regime, we obtain a plastic bubble state in which the oppositely driven particles remain trapped in the bubbles but the bubbles move past each other at a slow velocity due to a net imbalance in the bubble population. At higher drives, individual particles begin to jump from bubble to bubble. We show that the different phases and the transitions between them produce signatures in the velocity-force and differential mobility curves. We demonstrate that the critical force for escaping from the jammed state is nonmonotonic, with stripes exhibiting the lowest unjamming force.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium phase transition and cultural drift in the continuous-trait Axelrod model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard Axelrod model of cultural dissemination, based on discrete cultural traits, exhibits a non-equilibrium phase transition but is inherently limited by its inability to continuously probe the critical behavior. We address this limitation by introducing a generalized Axelrod model utilizing continuous cultural traits confined to the interval $[0,1]$, and a similarity threshold, $d$, that serves as a continuous control parameter representing cultural tolerance. This framework allows for a robust analysis of the model's critical properties and its dynamics under cultural drift (copying noise). For the perfect copying scenario, we precisely locate the critical threshold $d_c$, which separates the disordered (fragmented) and ordered (polarized) phases. Through Finite-Size Scaling, we find that the mean domain density vanishes continuously at $d_c$ with the exponent $\beta = 1/3$. Simultaneously, the largest domain fraction displays a surprising discontinuous jump at $d_c$. We find that the finite size effects in the critical region are governed by the exponent $\nu=2$ for both the continuous and discontinuous transitions. Under imperfect copying, persistent noise introduces a powerful selective pressure on the trait space, leading to the emergence of two symmetry-related attractors at the trait values $d$ and $1-d$. However, these noise-induced attractors prove fragile in the thermodynamic limit, becoming unstable at large lattice sizes, which directly accounts for the observed failure of the dynamics to freeze under sustained cultural drift. This suggests that in large, continuously evolving societies, true cultural convergence is highly unlikely, leading instead to sustained fragmentation and nonstationary dynamics where cultural domains never fully stabilize.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity in Constrained Many-Body Models: Scars, Fragmentation, and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic constraints in quantum many-body systems give rise to quantum states, whose behavior strongly depends on the choice of initial conditions. In recent years, these systems have drawn increasing interest because they provide insight into the mechanisms of thermalization and the situations where it can fail. In this work, we study a family of kinetically constrained models, including the celebrated Quantum Game of Life, from the perspective of quantum complexity, with a focus on entanglement, nonstabilizerness, and signatures of quantum chaos. By applying spectral diagnostics such as level statistics and spectral form factors, we demonstrate that these models show robust chaotic behavior while also supporting Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scar states. Remarkably, we find that even certain symmetry-resolved fragmented sectors can themselves host scarred eigenstates, highlighting the unexpected coexistence of chaos, scars, and fragmentation within the same family of Hamiltonians. To better understand these fragmented subspaces, we further characterize them using their quantum resource generation ability. In particular, we demonstrate that characterization of entanglement and the ability to generate nonstabilizerness can be instrumental in distinguishing different dynamically disconnected sectors.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Generalisation in Neural Approximations of Renormalisation Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data. Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.</description>

      <title>Surface-induced ordering and continuous breaking of translational symmetry in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface-induced liquid crystalline phase transitions evoke fundamental interest and can provide deeper insight into the nature of low-dimensional phase transitions. Board-like conjugated polymers are particularly interesting because they exhibit novel sanidic liquid crystalline mesophases that remain largely unexplored. Specifically, although preferential molecular orientation near the free surface has been observed in films of conjugated polymers, the mechanism of its formation remains unclear. Here, we use grazing-incidence X-ray scattering to monitor the formation and breaking of positional order in situ in thin films of two conjugated polymers representative of two classes: polythiophenes and polydiketopyrrolopyrroles. Our results reveal that the surface induces positional order in films of both conjugated polymers through the formation of a highly oriented, sanidic disordered mesophase at the surface. This ordering process continues upon cooling and undergoes multiple liquid crystalline transitions into more ordered phases, both at the surface and in the bulk, which can compete with each other. The positional smectic-like order parameter exhibits continuous temperature dependence near the transition, signifying a continuous breaking of translational symmetry by the surface. Theoretical analysis enables us to accurately describe the order parameter when critical behavior is considered.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group for classical liquids without recourse to hard-core reference systems: A study of three-dimensional Lennard-Jones liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [Phys. Rev. E 104, 014124 (2021)], we developed a method for analyzing classical liquids using the functional renormalization group (FRG) without relying on a hard-core reference system. In this paper, we extend that method to three-dimensional liquids. We describe an efficient approach for performing the spatial integrals that appear in the renormalization group equations, which is essential for realizing numerical calculations in three dimensions. As a demonstration of our method, we present its application to the Lennard-Jones liquid. By calculating thermodynamic quantities and the pair distribution function near the critical point, we find that, compared with integral equation methods, the FRG approach preserves thermodynamic consistency much more effectively and more accurately reproduces the results of molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we successfully capture characteristic phase-transition phenomena with FRG, such as the softening of pressure near the critical temperature. Our results suggest that FRG can provide a more accurate framework for describing classical liquids than conventional methods such as integral equation theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility, enabled by diverse transportation modes, is fundamental to urban functionality. Studying these movements across scales-from microscopic to macroscopic-yields valuable insights into urban dynamics. Local adaptation and (self-)organization in such systems are expected to result in dynamical behaviors that are represented by stationary trajectories of an appropriate effective action. In this study we develop a Lagrangian dynamical model for movement processes, using local population functions as the coordinate variables. An efficient gradient descent algorithm is introduced to estimate the optimal Lagrangian parameters minimizing a local error function of the dynamical process. We show that even a quadratic Lagrangian, incorporating dissipation, effectively captures the dynamics of synthetic and empirical movement data. The inferred models reveal that inertia and dissipation are of comparable importance, while interactions and randomness in the movements induce significant qualitative changes in model parameters. Our results provide an interpretable and generative model for human mobility, with potential applications in movement prediction.</description>

      <title>Subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Real critical exponents from the $\varepsilon$-expansion in an interacting $U(1)$ model with non-Hermitian $Z_4$ anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum optics and condensed matter physics non-Hermitian phenomena are often studied under the assumption of an open physical system. However, there are examples of intrinsically non-Hermitian, though often $\mathcal{PT}$ (parity-time) symmetric, not necessarily open systems, in which case the concept of gain and loss relative to an underlying environment is not primordial. A particularly intriguing example with experimental consequences in the literature is QCD at finite density. Motivated by the existence of such inherently non-Hermitian systems, here we study the critical behavior of a $U(1)$-invariant Lagrangian perturbed by a complex, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric $Z_{4}$ anisotropy. We find real critical exponents both in the region of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. In the former the coupling constants for fixed points or lines are real, whereas in the latter they become complex. Importantly, the most stable fixed point corresponds to the flow at large distances towards an effectively Hermitian $U(1)$ symmetric system. This constitutes an example where both the $U(1)$ and the Hermitian character are emergent features of the theory. This tells us about the importance and physical meaning of some non-Hermitian systems beyond interpretations involving gain and loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider unsteady ballistic heat transport in a semi-infinite Hooke chain with a free end and an arbitrary heat source. An analytical description of the evolution of the kinetic temperature is proposed in both discrete (exact) and continuum (approximate) formulations. The continualization of the discrete solution for kinetic temperature is performed through a large-time asymptotic estimate of the fundamental solution of the dynamical problem for the instantly perturbed conservative semi-infinite chain at the fronts of the incident and reflected thermal waves. By analyzing the continuum solution, we observe that any instantaneous heat supply (i.e., a heat pulse) results in the anti-localization of the reflected thermal wave. We demonstrate that sudden point heat supply leads to a transition to a non-equilibrium steady state, which, unexpectedly, may exist even in the non-dissipative case. The results of this paper are expected to provide insight into the continuum description of nanoscale heat transport.</description>

      <title>Family-Vicsek universality of the binary intrinsic dimension of nonequilibrium data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic dimension (ID) is a powerful tool to detect and quantify correlations from data. Recently, it has been successfully applied to study statistical and many-body systems in equilibrium, yet its application to systems away from equilibrium remains largely unexplored. Here we study the ID of nonequilibrium growth dynamics data, and show that even after reducing these data to binary form, their binary intrinsic dimension (BID) retains essential physical information. Specifically, we find that, akin to the surface width, it exhibits Family-Vicsek dynamical scaling -- a fundamental feature to describe universality in surface roughness phenomena. These findings highlight the ability of the BID to correctly discern key properties and correlations in nonequilibrium data, and open an avenue for alternative characterizations of out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The paper demonstrates that the canonical probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a bosonic system is multinomial and shows how the thermodynamics of the canonical system descends from this distribution. The categorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) of the multinomial distribution should be derived from constrained maximization of the entropy of the multinomial distribution, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper proposes to take instead the one-particle Boltzmann distribution. After this, the imposition of Clausius' equation on the Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution leads to an unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ that imposes the energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be substantially different from the inverse temperature. To disprove that $\beta$ should be equal to the inverse temperature, the paper presents an example where, with $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. But this would contradict the principle of maximum entropy.</description>

      <title>1/f^{3/2} Spectral Density at the Phonon Bottleneck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The common observation of anomalous `$1/f^\alpha$' relaxation with $\alpha&lt;2$ constitutes one of the enduring mysteries of condensed matter physics. Here it is shown that a $1/f^{\alpha}$ spectral density, with $\alpha = 3/2$, can arise in the response of an ensemble of two--level systems coupled to a heat bath by means of a system of Bosonic quasiparticles. The model considered is the classic model of Faughnan and Strandberg of the phonon bottleneck, and the anomalous response is associated with an approximate non-equilibrium steady state of the phonons maintained by slow spin relaxation. The frequency dependence of the response to an applied field is calculated analytically, revealing the emergence, in the limit of a strong bottleneck, of $\alpha=3/2$ behaviour over a diverging range of frequencies. The application of this result to experimental systems is discussed and comparisons are drawn with other systems that exhibit anomalous relaxation.</description>

Abstract: We provide an overview of studies of hysteresis in models of magnets. We discuss the shape of the hysteresis loop, dynamical symmetry breaking, and the dependence of the area of the loop on the amplitude and frequency of the driving field. We also discuss Barkhausen noise in the hysteresis loops, where the wide distribution of sizes of jumps in the magnetization may be modeled by the random-field Ising model. We discuss the distribution of sizes of these jumps in the random field Ising model on the Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>Statistical Signatures of Integrable and Non-Integrable Quantum Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Criticality of Absorbing State Transition toward Jamming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The jamming transition is traditionally regarded as a geometric transition governed by static contact networks. Recently, dynamic phase transitions of athermal particles under periodic shear provide a new lens on this problem, leading to a conjecture that jamming transition corresponds to an absorbing-state transition within the Manna (conserved directed percolation) universality class. Here, by re-examining the biased random organization model, a minimal model for particles under periodic shearing that the conjecture is based on, we uncover several criticality anomalies at high density at odds with Manna universality class. In three-dimensional monodisperse systems, we find crystallization disrupts the absorbing transition, while in dense binary mixtures, a distinct transition from absorbing to active-glass states emerges, signifying a new universality class of dynamic phase transition. Closer to the jamming point, the quenched heterogeneity in the contact network smears the dynamic transition via Griffiths effects and drives the system toward heterogeneous directed percolation. We propose a field theory with fractional time dynamics that unifies these phenomena, establishing a theoretical framework linking jamming, disorder, and dynamic criticality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos, Randomness and Universal Scaling of Entanglement in Various Krylov Spaces</title>

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for advancing quantum technologies, with considerable research efforts directed toward achieving its rapid and scalable generation. In this work, we derive an analytical expression for the time-averaged quantum Fisher information (QFI), enabling the detection of scalable multipartite entanglement dynamically generated by all quantum chaotic systems governed by Dyson's ensembles. Our approach integrates concepts of randomness and quantum chaos, demonstrating that the QFI is universally determined by the structure and dimension of the Krylov space that confines the chaotic dynamics. In particular, the QFI ranges from $N^2/3$ for $N$ qubits in the permutation-symmetric subspace (e.g. for chaotic kicked top models with long-range interactions), to $N$ when the dynamics extend over the full Hilbert space with or without bit reversal symmetry or parity symmetry (e.g. in chaotic models with short-range Ising-like interactions). In the former case, the QFI reveals multipartite entanglement among $N/3$ qubits and highlights the power of chaotic collective spin systems in generating scalable multipartite entanglement. Interestingly this result can be related to isotropic substructures in the Wigner distribution of chaotic states and demonstrates the efficacy of quantum chaos for Heisenberg-scaling quantum metrology. Finally, our general expression for the QFI agrees with that obtained for random states and, differently from out-of-time-order-correlators, it can also distinguish chaotic from integrable unstable spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead, also known as the interacting resonant level model in quantum impurity physics. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</description>

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space for Wigner-positive states and proposals for Wigner-negative states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm for sampling tightly confined random equilateral closed polygons in three-space which has runtime linear in the number of edges. Using symplectic geometry, sampling such polygons reduces to sampling a moment polytope, and in our confinement model this polytope turns out to be very natural from a combinatorial point of view. This connection to combinatorics yields both our fast sampling algorithm and explicit formulas for the expected distances of vertices to the origin. We use our algorithm to investigate the expected total curvature of confined polygons, leading to a very precise conjecture for the asymptotics of total curvature.</description>

      <title>Measuring full counting statistics in a trapped-ion quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the probability distribution function (PDF) and full counting statistics (FCS) play a fundamental role in characterizing the fluctuations of quantum observables, as they encode the complete information about these fluctuations. In this letter, we measure these two quantities in a trapped-ion quantum simulator for the transverse and longitudinal magnetization within a subsystem. We utilize the toolbox of classical shadows to postprocess the measurements performed in random bases. The measurement scheme efficiently allows access to the FCS and PDF of all possible operators on desired choices of subsystems of an extended quantum system.</description>

      <title>Exact non-Markovian master equations: a generalized derivation for Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact master equation that captures the dynamics of a quadratic quantum system linearly coupled to a Gaussian environment of the same statistics: the Gaussian Master Equation (GME). Unlike previous approaches, our formulation applies universally to both bosonic and fermionic setups, and remains valid even in the presence of initial system-environment correlations, allowing for the exact computation of the system's reduced density matrix across all parameter regimes. Remarkably, the GME shares the same operatorial structure as the Redfield equation and depends on a single kernel - a dressed environment correlation function accounting for all virtual interactions between the system and the environment. This simple structure grants a clear physical interpretation and makes the GME easy to simulate numerically, as we show by applying it to an open system based on two fermions coupled via superconductive pairing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <title>Boundary anomalous dimensions from BCFT: O($N$)-symmetric $\phi^{2n}$ theories with a boundary and higher-derivative generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $\phi^{2n}$ deformations of the O($N$)-symmetric (generalized) free theories with a flat boundary, where $n\geqslant 2$ is an integer. The generalized free theories refer to the $\Box^k$ free scalar theories with a higher-derivative kinetic term, which is related to the multicritical generalizations of the Lifshitz type. We assume that the (generalized) free theories and the deformed theories have boundary conformal symmetry and O($N$) global symmetry. The leading anomalous dimensions of some boundary operators are derived from the bulk multiplet recombination and analyticity constraints. We find that the $\epsilon^{1/2}$ expansion in the $\phi^6$-tricritical version of the special transition extends to other multicritical cases with larger odd integer $n$, and most of the higher derivative cases involve a noninteger power expansion in $\epsilon$. Using the analytic bootstrap, we further verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with boundary crossing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Mixed state deep thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Active particles in power-law potentials: steady state distributions and shape transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stationary states of an active Brownian particle (ABP) and run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in two dimensional power-law potentials, in the limit where translational diffusion is negligible. The potential energy of the particle has the form $U(r)\propto r^{n}$, where $n\geq 2$ and even. In two dimensions, we derive the exact equations for the positional probability distribution $\phi({\bf r})$ of ABP ($n\geq 2)$ and RTP ($n=2$), whose solutions are obtained under the assumption that the particle's orientation angle is Gaussian. Both analytical and numerical results show that, in all cases, $\phi({\bf r})$ has compact support and undergoes a phase transition-like shape change as a function of the trap strength. For ABP, our theory predicts a continuous transition in shape for $n=2$ and a discontinuous transition for $n&gt;2$, both of which agree with the simulation results. Simulations suggest the existence of both types of shape transition in the case of RTP as well. For ABP, in the strongly active regime, the orientational probability distribution is unimodal near the outer boundary but becomes bimodal towards the interior, signifying a transition from predominantly radial orientation to orbiting motion. In RTP, the analogous shape transition in the orientational distribution is almost absent.</description>

      <title>A blueprint for experiments exploring the Poincar\'e quantum recurrence theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum form of the Poincar\'e recurrence theorem stipulates that a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian and discrete energy levels returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a finite time. Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of Poincar\'e revivals. Our study of quantum recurrence provides new insight into how thermalization emerges in isolated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect in parity-time symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has been demonstrated in both closed and open Hermitian quantum systems. While some studies have linked the QMPE to Liouvillian exceptional points--non-Hermitian features emerged at the Liouvillian level--in open Hermitian quantum systems, it remains largely unexplored whether the QMPE can occur in intrinsic non-Hermitian systems, where non-Hermiticity is inherent at the Hamiltonian level. Here, we demonstrate unequivocally the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable parity-time-symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Using established quantifiers for QMPE, we show numerically that the QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian and Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when Hermitian Hamiltonian is restored. Interestingly, neither Hamiltonian nor Liouvillian exceptional points demarcate the boundaries of the QMPE regime. To complement numerical results, we develop an analytical description based on a long-time approximation of the relaxation dynamics of quantifiers. This approach allows us to decipher the number of intersections between two dynamical trajectories of quantifier starting from two initial conditions in the validity regime of the long-time approximation, thereby providing additional information that delineate the parameter regimes supporting the genuine QMPE. We further demonstrate the robustness of QMPE against increasing the number of qubits and dephasing effect. Our findings not only broaden the scope of the QMPE but also suggest its intricate interplay with non-Hermitian features beyond exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Emergent Isotropic-Nematic Transition in 3D Semiflexible Active Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active semiflexible filament collectives, ranging from motor-driven cytoskeletal filaments to slender organisms such as cyanobacteria and worm aggregates, abound in nature. Yet how activity and flexibility jointly govern their organization, especially Isotropic-Nematic (I-N) transition, remains poorly understood. Performing large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of 3D active semiflexible polymers with varying flexibility degrees, we show that tangential active forces systematically shift the I-N transition to higher densities, with the shift controlled by the flexibility degree and activity strength. Strikingly, activity alters the nature of the transition: discontinuous at low strengths, continuous at moderate strengths, and ultimately suppressed at high activity levels. The delayed I-N transition originates from enhanced collective bending fluctuations, resulting in chain shrinkage and enlargement of effective confinement tube. At moderate activity levels, these fluctuations can trigger large-scale excitations that stochastically drive temporal transitions between nematic and isotropic states, indicating an activity-induced instability of the nematic field. We summarize this behavior in non-equilibrium state diagrams of density and activity for different flexibility degrees.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models are Kelly Gamblers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.</description>
