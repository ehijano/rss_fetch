      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Predictive Computational Modeling of Growth and Remodeling in Tissue-Engineered Cardiovascular Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing clinically viable tissue-engineered cardiovascular implants remains a formidable challenge. Achieving reliable and durable outcomes requires a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving tissue evolution during in vitro maturation. Although considerable progress has been made in modeling soft tissue growth and remodeling, studies focused on the early stages of tissue engineering remain limited. Here, we present a general, thermodynamically consistent model to predict tissue evolution and mechanical response throughout maturation. The formulation utilizes a stress-driven homeostatic surface to capture volumetric growth, coupled with an energy-based approach to describe collagen densification via the strain energy of the fibers. We further employ a co-rotated intermediate configuration to ensure the model's consistency and generality. The framework is demonstrated with two numerical examples: a uniaxially constrained tissue strip validated against experimental data, and a biaxially constrained specimen subjected to a perturbation load. These results highlight the potential of the proposed model to advance the design and optimization of tissue-engineered implants with clinically relevant performance.</description>

      <title>Transformers with Attentive Federated Aggregation for Time Series Stock Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent innovations in transformers have shown their superior performance in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). The ability to capture long-range dependencies and interactions in sequential data has also triggered a great interest in time series modeling, leading to the widespread use of transformers in many time series applications. However, being the most common and crucial application, the adaptation of transformers to time series forecasting has remained limited, with both promising and inconsistent results. In contrast to the challenges in NLP and CV, time series problems not only add the complexity of order or temporal dependence among input sequences but also consider trend, level, and seasonality information that much of this data is valuable for decision making. The conventional training scheme has shown deficiencies regarding model overfitting, data scarcity, and privacy issues when working with transformers for a forecasting task. In this work, we propose attentive federated transformers for time series stock forecasting with better performance while preserving the privacy of participating enterprises. Empirical results on various stock data from the Yahoo! Finance website indicate the superiority of our proposed scheme in dealing with the above challenges and data heterogeneity in federated learning.</description>

      <title>Reliable Radiologic Skeletal Muscle Area Assessment -- A Biomarker for Cancer Cachexia Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer cachexia is a common metabolic disorder characterized by severe muscle atrophy which is associated with poor prognosis and quality of life. Monitoring skeletal muscle area (SMA) longitudinally through computed tomography (CT) scans, an imaging modality routinely acquired in cancer care, is an effective way to identify and track this condition. However, existing tools often lack full automation and exhibit inconsistent accuracy, limiting their potential for integration into clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we developed SMAART-AI (Skeletal Muscle Assessment-Automated and Reliable Tool-based on AI), an end-to-end automated pipeline powered by deep learning models (nnU-Net 2D) trained on mid-third lumbar level CT images with 5-fold cross-validation, ensuring generalizability and robustness. SMAART-AI incorporates an uncertainty-based mechanism to flag high-error SMA predictions for expert review, enhancing reliability. We combined the SMA, skeletal muscle index, BMI, and clinical data to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model designed to predict cachexia at the time of cancer diagnosis. Tested on the gastroesophageal cancer dataset, SMAART-AI achieved a Dice score of 97.80% +/- 0.93%, with SMA estimated across all four datasets in this study at a median absolute error of 2.48% compared to manual annotations with SliceOmatic. Uncertainty metrics-variance, entropy, and coefficient of variation-strongly correlated with SMA prediction errors (0.83, 0.76, and 0.73 respectively). The MLP model predicts cachexia with 79% precision, providing clinicians with a reliable tool for early diagnosis and intervention. By combining automation, accuracy, and uncertainty awareness, SMAART-AI bridges the gap between research and clinical application, offering a transformative approach to managing cancer cachexia.</description>

      <title>Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&amp;As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple Generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</description>

      <title>ML-Based Bidding Price Prediction for Pay-As-Bid Ancillary Services Markets: A Use Case in the German Control Reserve Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has led to greater volatility and unpredictability in electricity generation, posing challenges to grid stability. Ancillary service markets, such as the German control reserve market, allow industrial consumers and producers to offer flexibility in their power consumption or generation, contributing to grid stability while earning additional income. However, many participants use simple bidding strategies that may not maximize their revenues. This paper presents a methodology for forecasting bidding prices in pay-as-bid ancillary service markets, focusing on the German control reserve market. We evaluate various machine learning models, including Support Vector Regression, Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors, and compare their performance against benchmark models. To address the asymmetry in the revenue function of pay-as-bid markets, we introduce an offset adjustment technique that enhances the practical applicability of the forecasting models. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach improves potential revenues by 27.43 % to 37.31 % compared to baseline models. When analyzing the relationship between the model forecasting errors and the revenue, a negative correlation is measured for three markets; according to the results, a reduction of 1 EUR/MW model price forecasting error (MAE) statistically leads to a yearly revenue increase between 483 EUR/MW and 3,631 EUR/MW. The proposed methodology enables industrial participants to optimize their bidding strategies, leading to increased earnings and contributing to the efficiency and stability of the electrical grid.</description>

      <title>Synthesis Method for Obtaining Characteristic Modes of Multi-Structure Systems via independent Structure T-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient method for characteristic mode decomposition in multi-structure systems. By leveraging the translation and rotation matrices of vector spherical wavefunctions, our approach enables the synthesis of a composite system's characteristic modes using independently computed simulations of its constituent structures. The computationally intensive translation process is simplified by decomposing it into three streamlined sub-tasks: rotation, z-axis translation, and inverse rotation, collectively achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency. Furthermore, this method facilitates the exploration of structural orientation effects without incurring additional computational overhead. A series of illustrative numerical examples is provided to validate the accuracy of the proposed method and underscore its substantial advantages in both computational efficiency and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>A consistent diffuse-interface finite element approach to rapid melt--vapor dynamics with application to metal additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing via laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) faces performance-critical challenges due to complex melt pool and vapor dynamics, often oversimplified by computational models that neglect crucial aspects, such as vapor jet formation. To address this limitation, we propose a consistent computational multi-physics mesoscale model to study melt pool dynamics, laser-induced evaporation, and vapor flow. In addition to the evaporation-induced pressure jump, we also resolve the evaporation-induced volume expansion and the resulting velocity jump at the liquid--vapor interface. We use an anisothermal incompressible Navier--Stokes solver extended by a conservative diffuse level-set framework and integrate it into a matrix-free adaptive finite element framework. To ensure accurate physical solutions despite extreme density, pressure and velocity gradients across the diffuse liquid--vapor interface, we employ consistent interface source term formulations developed in our previous work. These formulations consider projection operations to extend solution variables from the sharp liquid--vapor interface into the computational domain. Benchmark examples, including film boiling, confirm the accuracy and versatility of the model. As a key result, we demonstrate the model's ability to capture the strong coupling between melt and vapor flow dynamics in PBF-LB/M based on simulations of stationary laser illumination on a metal plate. Additionally, we show the derivation of the well-known Anisimov model and extend it to a new hybrid model. This hybrid model, together with consistent interface source term formulations, especially for the level-set transport velocity, enables PBF-LB/M simulations that combine accurate physical results with the robustness of an incompressible, diffuse-interface computational modeling framework.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputing Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems by providing quantum speedup on near-term gate-based quantum computing systems. However, QAOA faces challenges for high-dimensional problems due to the large number of qubits required and the complexity of deep circuits, limiting its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we present a distributed QAOA (DQAOA), which leverages distributed computing strategies to decompose a large computational workload into smaller tasks that require fewer qubits and shallower circuits than necessitated to solve the original problem. These sub-problems are processed using a combination of high-performance and quantum computing resources. The global solution is iteratively updated by aggregating sub-solutions, allowing convergence toward the optimal solution. We demonstrate that DQAOA can handle considerably large-scale optimization problems (e.g., 1,000-bit problem) achieving a high approximation ratio ($\sim$99%) and short time-to-solution ($\sim$276 s), outperforming existing strategies. Furthermore, we realize DQAOA on a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, paving the way for practical applications of gate-based quantum computers in real-world optimization tasks. To extend DQAOA's applicability to materials science, we further develop an active learning algorithm integrated with our DQAOA (AL-DQAOA), which involves machine learning, DQAOA, and active data production in an iterative loop. We successfully optimize photonic structures using AL-DQAOA, indicating that solving real-world optimization problems using gate-based quantum computing is feasible. We expect the proposed DQAOA to be applicable to a wide range of optimization problems and AL-DQAOA to find broader applications in material design.</description>
