      <title>VCWorld: A Biological World Model for Virtual Cell Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual cell modeling aims to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Existing virtual cell models rely heavily on large-scale single-cell datasets, learning explicit mappings between gene expression and perturbations. Although recent models attempt to incorporate multi-source biological information, their generalization remains constrained by data quality, coverage, and batch effects. More critically, these models often function as black boxes, offering predictions without interpretability or consistency with biological principles, which undermines their credibility in scientific research. To address these challenges, we present VCWorld, a cell-level white-box simulator that integrates structured biological knowledge with the iterative reasoning capabilities of large language models to instantiate a biological world model. VCWorld operates in a data-efficient manner to reproduce perturbation-induced signaling cascades and generates interpretable, stepwise predictions alongside explicit mechanistic hypotheses. In drug perturbation benchmarks, VCWorld achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, and the inferred mechanistic pathways are consistent with publicly available biological evidence.</description>

      <title>Active Force Dynamics in Red Blood Cells Under Non-Invasive Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.</description>

      <title>TransientTrack: Advanced Multi-Object Tracking and Classification of Cancer Cells with Transient Fluorescent Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms. The code is available at https://github.com/bozeklab/TransientTrack.</description>

      <title>A Phase-field Model for Apoptotic Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of programmed cell death, namely apoptosis, is a natural mechanism that regulates healthy tissue, multicellular structures, and homeostasis. An improved understanding of apoptosis can significantly enhance our knowledge of biological processes and systems. For instance, pathogens can manipulate the apoptotic process to either evade immune detection or to facilitate their spread. Furthermore, of particular clinical interest is the ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis, hence allowing them to survive and proliferate uncontrollably. Thus, in this work, we propose a phase-field framework for simulating intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis induced by an activation field, including deriving the configurational mechanics underlying such phenomena. Along with exploring varying conditions needed to initiate or reduce apoptosis, this can serve as a starting point for computational therapeutic testing. To showcase model capabilities, we present simulations exhibiting different types of cellular dynamics produced when varying the mechanisms underlying apoptosis. The model is subsequently applied to probe different morphological transitions, such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, cavity formation and fragmentation. Lastly, we compare the characteristics observed in our simulations to electron microscopy images, providing additional support for the model.</description>
