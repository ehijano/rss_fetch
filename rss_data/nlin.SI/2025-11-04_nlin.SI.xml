      <title>Mixed superposition rules for Lie systems and compatible geometric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed superposition rules are, in short, a method to describe the general solutions of a time-dependent system of first-order differential equations, a so-called Lie system, in terms of particular solutions of other ones. This article is concerned with the theory of mixed superposition rules and their connections with geometric structures. We provide methods to obtain mixed superposition rules for systems admitting an imprimitive finite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields or given by a semidirect sum. In particular, we develop a novel mixed coalgebra method for Lie systems that are Hamiltonian relative to a Dirac structure, which is quite general, although we restrict to symplectic and contact manifolds in applications. This provides us with practical methods to derive mixed superposition rules and extends the coalgebra method to a new field of application while solving minor technical issues of the known formalism. Throughout the paper, we apply our results to physical systems including Schr\"odinger Lie systems, Riccati systems, time-dependent Calogero-Moser systems with external forces, time-dependent harmonic oscillators, and time-dependent thermodynamical systems, where general solutions can be obtained from reduced system solutions. Our results are finally extended to Lie systems of partial differential equations and a new source of such PDE Lie systems, related to the determination of approximate solutions of PDEs, is provided. An example based on the Tzitz\'eica equation and a related system is given.</description>

      <title>Exact periodic solutions of the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda equation with dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present exact pole dynamics solutions to the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda (gCLM) equation in a periodic geometry with dissipation $-\Lambda^\sigma$, where its spatial Fourier transform is $\widehat{\Lambda^\sigma}=|k|^\sigma$. The gCLM equation is a simplified model for singularity formation in the 3D incompressible Euler equations. It includes an advection term with parameter $a$, which allows different relative weights for advection and vortex stretching. There has been intense interest in the gCLM equation, and it has served as a proving ground for the development of methods to study singularity formation in the 3D Euler equations. Several exact solutions for the problem on the real line have been previously found by the method of pole dynamics, but only one such solution has been reported for the periodic geometry. We derive new periodic solutions for $a=0$ and $1/2$ and $\sigma=0$ and $1$, for which a closed collection of (periodically repeated) poles evolve in the complex plane. Self-similar finite-time blow-up of the solutions is analyzed and compared for the different values of $\sigma$, and to a global-in-time well-posedness theory for solutions with small data presented in a previous paper of the authors. Motivated by the exact solutions, the well-posedness theory is extended to include the case $a=0$, $\sigma \geq 0$. Several interesting features of the solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal bases for two-parameter quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we construct dual PBW bases of the positive and negative subalgebras of the two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ in classical types, as used in our earlier work arXiv:2407.01450. Following the ideas of Leclerc and Clark-Hill-Wang, we introduce the two-parameter shuffle algebra and relate it to the subalgebras above. We then use the combinatorics of dominant Lyndon words to establish the main results.</description>
