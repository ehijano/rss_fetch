      <title>Transport Efficiency for Networks Obtained by Vertex Merging Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport is an important function of networks. Studying transport efficiency sheds light on the dynamic processes occurring within various underlying structures and offers a wide range of applications. To construct networks with different transport efficiencies, we focus on the networks obtained by vertex merging operation, which involves connecting multiple graphs through a single node. In this paper, we examine unbiased random walks on these networks and analyze their first-passage properties, including the mean first-passage time (MFPT), the mean trapping time (MTT), and the global-mean first-passage time (GFPT), which characterizes the transport (search) efficiency within the networks. We rigorously derive close-form solutions for these quantities. Results show that all these quantities are governed by the first-passage properties of the constituent components. Additionally, we propose a general method for optimizing the transport (search) efficiency by selecting a suitable node and adjusting the growth of the number of nodes in the subgraphs. We validate our findings using lollipop and barbell graphs. Our results indicate that for an arbitrary GFPT scaling exponent $\alpha \in [1, 3]$, we can construct a network with GFPT scales with the network size $N$ as $\text{GFPT} \sim N^{\alpha}$ through vertex merging operation. These conclusions provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing network structures.</description>

      <title>Effective and asymptotic scaling in a one-dimensional billiard problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of power laws that govern the large-time dynamics of a one-dimensional billiard of $N$ point particles is analysed. In the initial state, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\geq 0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The dynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity. Due to elastic inter-particle collisions the whole system gradually comes into motion, filling both right and left half-lines. As shown by S. Chakraborti, A. Dhar, P. Krapivsky, SciPost Phys. 13 (2022) 074, an inherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes: the shock wave that propagates in $x\geq 0$ and the splash region in $x&lt;0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by universal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the system and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to acquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics simulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the theory of continuous phase transitions. We present results for the effective exponents that govern the large-time behaviour of the shock-wave front, the number of collisions, the energies and momentum of different modes and analyse their tendency to approach corresponding universal values.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation of the Kuramoto model on fruit-fly connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distance from equilibrium using the Kuramoto model via the degree of fluctuation-dissipation violation as the consequence of different levels of edge weight anisotropies. This is achieved by solving the synchronization equations on the raw, homeostatic weighted and a random inhibitory edge variant of a real full fly (FF) connectome, containing $\simeq 10^5$ neuron cell nodes. We investigate these systems close to their synchronization transition critical points. While the topological(graph) dimension is high: $d \simeq 6$ the spectral dimensions of the variants, relevant in describing the synchronization behavior, are lower than the upper critical dimension: $d_s \simeq 2 &lt; d_c=4$, suggesting relevant fluctuation effects and non mean-field scaling behavior. By measuring the auto-correlations and the auto-response functions for small perturbations we calculate the fluctuation-dissipation ratios (FDR) for the different variants of different anisotropy levels of the FF connectome. Numerical evidence is presented that the FDRs follow the level of anisotropy of these non-equilibrium systems in agreement with the expectations. We also compare these results with those on a symmetric random graph of similar size. We provide a detailed network analysis of the FF connectome and calculate the level of hierarchy, also related to the anisotropy. Finally, we provide some partial results for the periodic forced Kuramoto, the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09292</link>

Abstract: Correlations between the energies of a system's spectrum are one of the defining features of quantum chaos. They can be probed using the Spectral Form Factor (SFF). We investigate how each spectral distance contributes in building this two-point correlation function. Specifically, starting from the spectral distribution of $k$-th neighbor level spacing ($k$nLS), we provide analytical expressions for the $k$-th neighbor Spectral Form Factor ($k$nSFF). We do so for the three Gaussian Random Matrix ensembles and the `Poissonian' ensemble of uncorrelated energy levels. We study the properties of the $k$nSFF, namely its minimum value and the time at which this minimum is reached, as well as the energy spacing with the deepest $k$nSFF. This allows us to quantify the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the SFF ramp, which is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos. In particular, we show how the onset of the ramp, characterized either by the dip or the Thouless time, shifts to shorter times as contributions from longer-range spectral distance are included. Interestingly, the even and odd neighbors contribute quite distinctively, the first being the most important to built the ramp. They respectively yield a resonance or antiresonance in the ramp. All of our analytical results are tested against numerical realizations of random matrices. We complete our analysis and show how the introduced tools help characterize the spectral properties of a physical many-body system by looking at the interacting XXZ Heisenberg model with local on-site disorder that allows transitioning between the chaotic and integrable regimes.</description>
