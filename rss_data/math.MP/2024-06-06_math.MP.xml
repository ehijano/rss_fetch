      <title>Quantum Mechanics of Particles Constrained to Spiral Curves with Application to Polyene Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Due to advances in synthesizing lower dimensional materials there is the challenge of finding the wave equation that effectively describes quantum particles moving on 1D and 2D domains. Jensen and Koppe and Da Costa independently introduced a confining potential formalism showing that the effective constrained dynamics is subjected to a scalar geometry-induced potential; for the confinement to a curve, the potential depends on the curve's curvature function.
  Method: To characterize the $\pi$ electrons in polyenes, we follow two approaches. First, we utilize a weakened Coulomb potential associated with a spiral curve. The solution to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions yields Bessel functions, and the spectrum is obtained analytically. We employ the particle-in-a-box model in the second approach, incorporating effective mass corrections. The $\pi$-$\pi^*$ transitions of polyenes were calculated in good experimental agreement with both approaches, although with different wave functions.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Vortices with Excited Normal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider head-on collisions at critical coupling of vortices modelled by the Abelian-Higgs model. We investigate the 2-vortex scattering, whereby the vortices are excited by the shape mode causing fluctuations in the gauge-invariant quantities. When the vortices are excited with a sufficiently large amplitude the moduli space approximation fails, and we observe an interesting behaviour in which the vortices can become trapped in a quasi-bound state with multiple bounces. We perform a detailed investigation on the behaviour of these excited vortices and sample a phase space of solutions. Interestingly, we find a fractal structure dependent on the initial phase of the mode and velocity of the vortices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reduce Yang-Mills equations for $SO^+(p,q)$, $Spin^+(p,q)$ and $SU(n)$ bundles, with constant and isotropic metrics, by developing the concept of $SO^+(p,q)$-equivariance. This allows us to model the electroweak interaction and $SO^+(p,q)$ bundles with a non-linear second order differential equation as well as the weak and strong interaction with a non-linear wave equation.</description>

      <title>Minimal W-algebras with non-admissible levels and intermediate Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Kawasetsu:2018irs}, Kawasetsu proved that the simple W-algebra associated with a minimal nilpotent element $W_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite for $\mathfrak{g}=D_4,E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6$. In this paper, we study ${W}_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ algebra for $\mathfrak{g}=E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6+1$. We determine all irreducible (Ramond twisted) modules, compute their characters and find coset constructions and Hecke operator interpretations. These W-algebras are closely related to intermediate Lie algebras and intermediate vertex subalgebras.</description>

      <title>C*-framework for higher-order bulk-boundary correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical crystal is a finite piece of a material which may be invariant under some point symmetry group. If it is a so-called intrinsic higher-order topological insulator or superconductor then it displays boundary modes at hinges or corners protected by the crystalline symmetry and the bulk topology. We explain the mechanism behind that using operator K-theory. Specifically, we derive a groupoid $C^\ast$-algebra that 1) encodes the dynamics of the electrons in the infinite size limit of a crystal; 2) remembers the boundary conditions at the crystal's boundaries, and 3) accepts a natural action by the point symmetries of the atomic lattice. The filtrations of the groupoid's unit space by closed subsets that are invariant under the groupoid and point group actions supply equivariant co-filtrations of the groupoid $C^\ast$-algebra. We show that specific derivations of the induced spectral sequences in twisted equivariant K-theories enumerate all non-trivial higher-order bulk-boundary correspondences.</description>

      <title>Note on $Spin(3,1)$ tensors, the Dirac field and $GL(k, \mathbb{R})$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the rank decomposition of a real matrix $r$, which is a $Spin(3,1)$ tensor, leads to $2k$ Majorana bispinors, where $k= rank\: r$. The Majorana bispinors are determined up to local $GL(k, \mathbb{R})$ transformations. The bispinors are combined in pairs to form $k$ complex Dirac fields. We analyze in detail the case $k=1$, in which there is just one Dirac field with the standard Lagrangian. The $GL(1, \mathbb{R})$ symmetry gives rise to a new conserved current, different from the well known $U(1)$ current. The $U(1)$ symmetry is present too. All global continuous internal symmetries in the $k=1$ case form the $SO(2,1)$ group. As a side result, we clarify the discussed in literature issue whether there exist algebraic constraints for the matrix $r$ which would be equivalent to the condition $rank\: r=1$.</description>

      <title>Gravitating vortices and Symplectic Reduction by Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a novel approach to the existence problem for gravitating vortices on a Riemann surface based on symplectic reduction by stages, which seems to be new in the PDE as well as the gauge theory literature. The main technical tool for our study is the reduced $\alpha$-K-energy, for which we establish convexity properties by means of finite-energy pluripotential theory, as recently applied to the study of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. Using these methods, we prove that the existence of solutions to the gravitating vortex equations on the sphere implies the polystability of the effective divisor defined by the zeroes of the Higgs field. This approach also enables us to establish the uniqueness of gravitating vortices in any admissible K\"ahler class, in the absence of automorphisms. Lastly, we also prove the existence of solutions for the gravitating vortex equations for genus $g\geq 1$ for certain ranges of the coupling constant $\alpha$ and the volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to graph theory, from a geometric viewpoint. A finite graph $X$ is described by its adjacency matrix $d\in M_N(0,1)$, which can be thought of as a kind of discrete Laplacian, and we first discuss the basics of graph theory, by using $d$ and linear algebra tools. Then we discuss the computation of the classical and quantum symmetry groups $G(X)\subset G^+(X)$, which must leave invariant the eigenspaces of $d$. Finally, we discuss similar questions for the quantum graphs, with these being again described by certain matrices $d\in M_N(\mathbb C)$, but in a more twisted way.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard derivation of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation of a quantum dynamical semigroup from the Kraus representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new nonstandard proof of a well-known theorem that the generator $L$ of a quantum dynamical semigroup $\exp(tL)$ on a finite-dimensional quantum system has a specific form called a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generator (also known as a Lindbladian) and vice versa. The proof starts from the Kraus representation of the quantum channel $\exp (\delta t L)$ for an infinitesimal hyperreal number $\delta t&gt;0$ and then estimates the orders of the traceless components of the Kraus operators. The jump operators then naturally arise as the standard parts of the traceless parts divided by $\sqrt{\delta t}$. We also give a nonstandard proof of a related fact that close completely positive maps have close Kraus operators.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Active Brownian Particles with Dry Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a field theoretic approach to capture the motion of a particle with dry friction for one- and two-dimensional diffusive particles, and further expand the framework for two-dimensional active Brownian particles. Starting with the Fokker-Planck equation and introducing the Hermite polynomials as the corresponding eigen-functions, we obtain the actions and propagators. Using a perturbation expansion, we calculate the effective diffusion coefficient in the presence of both wet and dry frictions in a perturbative way via the Green-Kubo relation. We further compare the analytical result with the numerical simulation. Our result can be used to estimate the values of dry friction coefficient in experiments.</description>

      <title>Steady supersonic combustion flows with a contact discontinuity in two-dimensional finitely long nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the two-dimensional steady supersonic combustion flows with a contact discontinuity moving through a nozzle of finite length. Mathematically, it can be formulated as a free boundary value problem governed by the two -dimensional steady combustion Euler equations with a contact discontinuity as the free boundary. The main mathematical difficulties are that the contact discontinuity is a characteristic free boundary and the equations for all states are coupled with each other due to the combustion process. We first employ the Lagrangian coordinate transformation to fix the free boundary. Then by introducing the flow slope and Bernoulli function, we further reduce the fixed boundary value problem into an initial boundary value problem for a first order hyperbolic system coupled with several ordinary differential equations. A new iteration scheme is developed near the background states by employing the intrinsic structure of the equation for the mass fraction of the non-combustion gas. We show that there is a fixed point for the iteration by deriving some novel $C^{1,\alpha}$-estimates of the solutions and applying the fixed point theorem, and then the uniqueness of the fixed point is proved by a contraction argument. On the other hand, a quasi-one-dimensional approximate system is often used to simplify the two-dimensional steady supersonic combustion model. The error between these two systems is estimated. Finally, given a piece-wise $C^{1,\alpha}$-solution containing a contact discontinuity with piece-wise constant states on the entrance of the nozzle, we can show that the solution is the piece-wise constant states with a straight contact discontinuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $\mathcal O$, a proper ideal $\mathcal I$, and a resolution of $\mathcal O/ \mathcal I$ by projective $\mathcal O $-modules, we construct an explicit Koszul-Tate resolution. We call it the arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution since it is indexed by decorated trees. When the $ \mathcal O$-module resolution has finite length, only finitely many operations are needed in our constructions -- this is to be compared with the classical Tate algorithm, which requires infinitely many such computations if $ \mathcal I$ is not a complete intersection. As a by-product of our construction, the initial projective $\mathcal O $-module resolution becomes equipped with an explicit $A_\infty$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Higher-Matter and Landau-Ginzburg Theory of Higher-Group Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-matter is defined by higher-representation of a symmetry algebra, such as the $p$-form symmetries, higher-group symmetries or higher-categorical symmetries. In this paper, we focus on the cases of higher-group symmetries, which are formulated in terms of the strictification of weak higher-groups. We systematically investigate higher-matter charged under 2-group symmetries, defined by automorphism 2-representations. Furthermore, we construct a Lagrangian formulation of such higher-matter fields coupled to 2-group gauge fields in the path space of the spacetime manifold. We interpret such model as the Landau-Ginzburg theory for 2-group symmetries, and discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2-group symmetries under this framework. Examples of discrete and continuous 2-groups are discussed. Interestingly, we find that a non-split 2-group symmetry can admit an SSB to a split 2-group symmetry, where the Postnikov class is trivialized. We also briefly discuss the strictification of weak 3-groups, weak 3-group gauge fields and 3-representations in special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to explain the amplification of curvature perturbations on small scales arising from the phenomenon of self-resonance. By making a series expansion of the inflationary potential and employing perturbative techniques to solve for the inflaton field, we reformulate the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation into a Hill equation. Then, we derive expressions for the Floquet exponents corresponding to a potential having both cubic and quartic terms in its expansion. Our analytical results are then compared with numerical computations. Moreover, we propose potential applications including the generation of Primordial Black Holes, Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves, and Oscillons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study of holographic stress tensor correlators on general Riemann surfaces, extending beyond the previously well-studied torus cases to explore higher genus conformal field theories (CFTs) within the framework of the Anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We develop a methodological approach to compute holographic stress tensor correlators, employing the Schottky uniformization technique to address the handlebody solutions for higher genus Riemann surfaces. Through rigorous calculations, we derive four-point stress tensor correlators, alongside recurrence relations for higher-point correlators, within the $\mathrm{AdS}_3/\mathrm{CFT}_2$ context. Additionally, our research delves into the holography of cutoff $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ spaces, offering novel insights into the lower-point correlators of the $T\bar{T}$-deformed theories on higher genus Riemann surfaces up to the first deformation order.</description>

      <title>Variational Prior Replacement in Bayesian Inference and Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many scientific investigations require that the values of a set of model parameters are estimated using recorded data. In Bayesian inference, information from both observed data and prior knowledge is combined to update model parameters probabilistically. Prior information represents our belief about the range of values that the variables can take, and their relative probabilities when considered independently of recorded data. Situations arise in which we wish to change prior information: (i) the subjective nature of prior information, (ii) cases in which we wish to test different states of prior information as hypothesis tests, and (iii) information from new studies may emerge so prior information may evolve over time. Estimating the solution to any single inference problem is usually computationally costly, as it typically requires thousands of model samples and their forward simulations. Therefore, recalculating the Bayesian solution every time prior information changes can be extremely expensive. We develop a mathematical formulation that allows prior information to be changed in a solution using variational methods, without performing Bayesian inference on each occasion. In this method, existing prior information is removed from a previously obtained posterior distribution and is replaced by new prior information. We therefore call the methodology variational prior replacement (VPR). We demonstrate VPR using a 2D seismic full waveform inversion example, where VPR provides almost identical posterior solutions compared to those obtained by solving independent inference problems using different priors. The former can be completed within minutes even on a laptop whereas the latter requires days of computations using high-performance computing resources. We demonstrate the value of the method by comparing the posterior solutions obtained using three different types of prior information.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a logarithmic in $r$ factor. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>

      <title>Complementary polynomials in quantum signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing is a framework for implementing polynomial functions on quantum computers. To implement a given polynomial $P$, one must first construct a corresponding complementary polynomial $Q$. Existing approaches to this problem employ numerical methods that are not amenable to explicit error analysis. We present a new approach to complementary polynomials using complex analysis. Our main mathematical result is a contour integral representation for a canonical complementary polynomial. The integral representation on the unit circle has a particularly simple and efficacious Fourier analytic interpretation, which we use to develop a Fast Fourier Transform-based algorithm for the efficient calculation of $Q$ in the monomial basis with explicit error guarantees. Numerical evidence that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art optimization-based method for computing complementary polynomials is provided.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow and the conformal block expansion for strings in AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of spectrally flowed four-point functions in the SL(2,$\mathbb{R}$) WZW model, focusing on their conformal block decomposition. Dei and Eberhardt conjectured a general formula relating these observables to their unflowed counterparts. Although the latter are not known in closed form, their conformal block expansion has been formally established. By combining this information with the integral transform that encodes the effect of spectral flow, we show how to describe a considerable number of $s$-channel exchanges, including cases with both flowed and unflowed intermediate states. For all such processes, we compute the normalization of the corresponding conformal blocks in terms of products of the recently derived flowed three-point functions with arbitrary spectral flow charges. Our results constitute a highly non-trivial consistency check, thus strongly supporting the aforementioned conjecture, and establishing its computational power.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Assisted Metropolis-Hastings for Bayesian Estimation of Critical Exponent on Elliptic Black Hole Solution in 4D Using Quantum Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical gravitational collapse is known to produce continuous self-similar solutions characterized by the Choptuik critical exponent, $\gamma$. We examine all solutions within the complete domains of the linear perturbation equations, considering the numerical measurement errors. Specifically, we study quantum perturbation theory for the four-dimensional Einstein-axion-dilaton system of the elliptic class of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ transformations. We developed a novel artificial neural network-assisted Metropolis-Hastings based on quantum perturbation theory to find the critical exponent in a Bayesian framework. Unlike existing methods, this new probabilistic approach identifies the available deterministic solutions and explores the range of physically distinguishable critical exponents that may arise due to numerical measurement errors.</description>

      <title>A Brillouin torus decomposition for two-dimensional topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-band Chern insulators are topologically classified by the Chern number, $c$, which is given by the integral of the Berry curvature of the occupied band over the Brillouin torus. The curvature itself comes from the imaginary part of a more basic object, the quantum geometric tensor, $Q$. On the other hand, the integral over the Brillouin torus of the real part of $Q$ gives rise to another magnitude, the quantum volume, $v_{g}$, that like $c$, jumps when the system undergoes a topological phase transition and satisfies the inequality $v_{g}\ge 2\vert c \vert$. The information contained in $v_g$ about the topology of the system has been investigated recently. In this paper we present new results regarding the underlying geometric structure of two-dimensional two-band topological insulators. Since a generic model describing the system can be characterized by a map, the classifying map, from the Brillouin torus to the two-sphere, we study its properties at the geometric level. We present a procedure for splitting the Brillouin torus into different sectors in such a way that the classifying map when restricted to each of them is a local diffeomorphism. By doing so, in the topological phases we are able to isolate a region contained in the Brillouin torus whose volume is the minimal one, $v_{min}=2\vert c \vert$ and the integral of the Berry curvature on it is $c$. For cases in which $v_{g}&gt; 2\vert c \vert$, the regions contributing to the excess of volume, $v_{ex}=v_{g}-2\vert c \vert$, are found and characterized. In addition, the present work makes contact with, and clarifies, some interpretations of the quantum volume in terms of the Euler characteristic number that were done in the recent literature. We illustrate our findings with a careful analysis of some selected models for Chern insulators corresponding to tight-binding Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: We consider a random family of Dirac operators on $N$ parallel real lines, modelling for example a graphene nanoribbon. We establish a localization criterion involving properties on the group generated by transfer matrices. In particular, we consider not only the case where this group is the symplectic group but also a strict subgroup of it. We establish under quite general hypotheses that the sum of the Lyapunov exponents and the integrated density of states are H\"older continuous. Moreover, for a set of concrete cases where the potentials are on Pauli matrices, we compute the transfer matrices and prove either localization or delocalization, depending on the potential and on the parity of $N$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-P\'olya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of soliton lengths in a multicolor box-ball system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.04458v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The box-ball systems are integrable cellular automata whose long-time behavior is characterized by soliton solutions, with rich connections to other integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this paper, we consider a multicolor box-ball system with two types of random initial configurations and obtain sharp scaling limits of the soliton lengths as the system size tends to infinity. We obtain a sharp scaling limit of soliton lengths that turns out to be more delicate than that in the single color case established in [Levine, Lyu, Pike '20]. A large part of our analysis is devoted to studying the associated carrier process, which is a multi-dimensional Markov chain on the orthant, whose excursions and running maxima are closely related to soliton lengths. We establish the sharp scaling of its ruin probabilities, Skorokhod decomposition, strong law of large numbers, and weak diffusive scaling limit to a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion with explicit parameters. We also establish and utilize complementary descriptions of the soliton lengths and numbers in terms of modified Greene-Kleitman invariants for the box-ball systems and associated circular exclusion processes.</description>

Abstract: The forward and backward shift relations are basic properties of the (basic) hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme (Jacobi, Askey-Wilson, $q$-Racah, big $q$-Jacobi etc.) and they are related to the factorization of the differential or difference operators. Based on other factorizations, we obtain another type of forward and backward shift relations. Essentially, these shift relations shift only the parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonality of eigenstates of different energies and its implications in potential scattering are unlabeled. Scalar products of scattering states of different energies are found to have finite non-orthogonal terms in potentials of finite widths. Their superpositions have time-dependent norms, and are not suitable for isolate states. In these systems, a perturbative method and a variational method are viable methods for finding a rigorous transition probability that describes phenomena completely. In various exceptional potentials, an orthogonality is satisfied.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Gibbs measure for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the one-dimensional torus $\mathbb T$, that was introduced in a seminal paper by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). We show that in the large torus limit, the measure exhibits a phase transition, depending on the size of the nonlinearity. This phase transition was originally conjectured on the basis of numerical simulation by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). Its existence is however striking in view of a series of negative results by McKean (1995) and Rider (2002).</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the numerical simulation of time domain inverse acoustic scattering problems with a point-like scatterer, multiple point-like scatterers or normal size scatterers. Based on the Green's function and the application of the time convolution, direct sampling methods are proposed to reconstruct the location of the scatterer. The proposed methods involve only integral calculus without solving any equations and are easy to implement. Numerical experiments are provided to show the effectiveness and robustness of the methods.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Geometry to Higher Order in the Infinitesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential geometry may be generalized to allow infinitesimals to any order. The purpose of the present contribution is to show that the theory so developed expands received geometrical ideas in an interesting way, rich in potential for future exploration. The first order of business is to furnish the notion of a higher tangent vector, as defined abstractly by means of commutative algebra, with a workable interpretation in terms of spatial intuition. Then we introduce the differential calculus of the so-called jet connection, viz., an extension of the usual affine connection that takes higher tangent vectors as its arguments -- thereby enabling us to give a sense to parallel transport in the direction of a higher tangent, what has (to our knowledge) never been entertained before. After generalizing the Riemannian metric tensor to include a dependence up to any order in the infinitesimals, we arrive at natural analogues of the Levi-Civita connection and the Riemannian curvature tensor which display novel phenomena rooted in interactions among infinitesimals differing in order. Finally on the integral side, an intrinsic theory of integration adapted to integrands possibly of higher than first order in the differentials is developed, with a view towards eventually defining an action functional that will be applicable in the general theory of relativity.</description>

Using representation theoretic arguments and hypergeometric summation technique, we derive the presentation of the probability mass function by a single $q$-Racah polynomial, and also the presentation of the cumulative distribution function in terms of a terminating ${}_4 \phi_3$-hypergeometric series.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence based on effective information(EI) suggests that complex systems may exhibit a phenomenon called causal emergence(CE), where the macro-dynamics demonstrate a stronger causal effect than the micro-dynamics. However, a challenge in this theory is the dependence on the method used to coarse-grain the system. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this and singular value decomposition. Our research not only reveals a strong correlation between the proximity of a Markov chain being dynamically reversible and EI in assessing causal effects across various scenarios but also demonstrates that EI is constrained by the logarithm of the approximate dynamical reversibility. Leveraging this concept, we present an innovative approach to quantifying CE that is agnostic to specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the inherent characteristics of Markov dynamics. Through empirical evaluations on examples of boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks, we validate our refined CE definition.</description>

Abstract: Equations of motion of a charged symmetrical body in external constant and homogeneous electric and magnetic fields are deduced starting from the variational problem, where the body is considered as a system of charged point particles subject to holonomic constraints. The final equations are written for the center-of mass-coordinate, rotation matrix and angular velocity. General solution to the equations of motion is obtained for the case of a charged ball. For the case of a symmetrical charged body (solenoid), the task of obtaining the general solution is reduced to the problem of a one-dimensional cubic pseudo-oscillator. Besides, we present a one-parametric family of solutions to the problem in elementary functions.</description>

Abstract: We compute the leading order asymptotic of the maximum of the characteristic polynomial for i.i.d. matrices with real or complex entries. In particular, this result is new even for real Ginibre matrices, which was left as an open problem in [arXiv:2303.09912]; the complex Ginibre case was covered in [arXiv:1902.01983]. These are the first universality results for the non--Hermitian analog of the first order term of the Fyodorov--Hiary--Keating conjecture. Our methods are based on constructing a coupling to the branching random walk via Dyson Brownian motion. In particular, we find a new connection between real i.i.d. matrices and inhomogeneous branching random walk.</description>
