      <title>Violation of Spin Paramagnetic limit in Bi/Ni Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a violation of the spin-paramagnetic limit in the in-plane upper critical field ($B_{C2}^{\parallel}$) in Bi(10 nm)/Ni(1 nm) bilayers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Superconductivity emerges at the interface through the formation of an ultrathin NiBi$_3$ layer, which hosts a remarkably robust superconducting state under in-plane magnetic fields. To account for the $B_{C2}^{\parallel}$ enhancement, we evaluate two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity models incorporating spin-orbit scattering and Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. However, none of these mechanisms fully capture the observed behavior. We discuss the potential role of unconventional pairing, possibly linked to spin fluctuations. Our findings suggest that, in the 2D limit, NiBi$_3$ may support a superconducting state beyond the standard spin-singlet framework.</description>

      <title>Thermal rectification in jointless Pb solid wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal rectification is observed in jointless Pb wires at temperatures near the superconducting transition of Pb under magnetic fields. Using different magnetic-field (H) response of temperature dependence of thermal conductivity (\k{appa}-T) under H parallel to J and H perpendicular to J where J is heat flow, we fabricated a jointless thermal diode. Thermal rectification is observed with the thermal rectification ratio (TRR) of 1.5 and the difference in \k{appa} of 330 W m-1 K-1 at T = 5.11 K under H = 400 Oe for a Pb wire with a 50%-bent (H perpendicular to J) and 50%-straight (H parallel to J) structure. The peak temperature of TRR can be tuned by the strength of applied magnetic field. By changing bent ratio to 40%-bent, a higher TRR exceeding 2 was observed. The Pb-jointless thermal diode will be a useful material for thermal management at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Accurate measurement of energy relaxation via flux-flow instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate flux-flow instability (FFI) in a superconducting single-crystal titanium nitride (TiN) film with negligible volume pinning. By studying the critical current density in 12-nm thick TiN strips of varying widths, we accurately identify the experimental parameters at which the FFI regime occurs. A comprehensive analysis of critical velocity measurements allows us to determine the quasiparticle energy relaxation time, $\tau_E$. By comparing our results with the $\tau_E$ values obtained from other experimental methods, we gain insight into the dominant microscopic process that governs quasiparticle relaxation within the vortex core in TiN. This mechanism is driven by an increase in quasiparticle temperature relative to phonons, rather than by quasiparticles leaving the core. Our findings indicate that $\tau_E$ can be accurately determined through FFI measurements.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in W3Re2C with chiral structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover superconductivity in cubic W3Re2C with chiral structure and the superconducting transition temperature Tc is about 6.2 K. Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that W3Re2C is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor with full isotropic gap. Moreover, first-principles calculations indicate that the electron-phonon coupling primarily arises from interactions between W/Re 5d electronic states and their low-frequency phonons. Furthermore, the breaking of inversion symmetry in W3Re2C facilitates the emergence of Weyl points in the electronic structure. Therefore, W3Re2C can serve as a promising platform for investigating the influences of chiral structure on both superconductivity and band topology.</description>

      <title>The superconducting grid-states qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence errors arising from noisy environments remain a central obstacle to progress in quantum computation and information processing. Quantum error correction (QEC) based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) protocol offers a powerful strategy to overcome this challenge, with successful demonstrations in trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonics. Beyond active QEC, a compelling alternative is to engineer Hamiltonians that intrinsically enforce stabilizers, offering passive protection akin to topological models. Inspired by the GKP encoding scheme, we implement a superconducting qubit whose eigenstates form protected grid states - long envisioned but not previously realized - by integrating an effective Cooper-quartet junction with a quantum phase-slip element embedded in a high-impedance circuit. Spectroscopic measurements reveal pairs of degenerate states separated by large energy gaps, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Remarkably, our observations indicate that the circuit tolerates small disorders and gains robustness against environmental noise as its parameters approach the ideal regime, establishing a new framework for exploring superconducting hardware. These findings also showcase the versatility of the superconducting circuit toolbox, setting the stage for future exploration of advanced solid-state devices with emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field and Temperature Limits of a Kinetic-Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.</description>

      <title>Competing and Intertwined Orders in Boson-Doped Mott Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental advances in cold atom quantum simulators, we explore the experimentally implemented bosonic $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the square lattice using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. By tuning the doping level $\delta$ and hopping ratio $t'/t$, we uncover six distinct quantum phases, several of which go far beyond the conventional paradigm of phase-coherent superfluidity (SF) expected for bosonic systems. In particular, in the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, doped holes are tightly bound into pairs, giving rise to a pair density wave (PDW) phase at low doping and small $|t'/t|$, which is suppressed on the $t'&lt;0$ side, resulting in a disordered PDW state that lacks coherence of either individual bosons or pairs. Upon further doping, bosons can regain phase coherence and form a SF* state, characterized by condensation at emergent incommensurate momenta concurrent with an incommensurate magnetic order. On the $t'&gt;0$ side, the sign-induced kinetic frustration inherently disfavors local AFM correlations, leading to a phase separation in which doped holes cluster into ferromagnetic (FM) domains spatially separated by undoped AFM regions. Upon further doping, this inhomogeneous state evolves into a uniform SF + $xy$-FM phase. Finally, we propose a concrete experimental scheme to realize both signs of $t'/t$ in Rydberg tweezer arrays, with an explicit mapping between model parameters and experimentally accessible regimes. Our results reveal competing and intertwined orders in doped antiferromagnets, which are relevant to central issues in high-$T_c$ superconductivity, reflecting the frustrated interplay between doped holes and spin background.</description>

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect has garnered significant interest due to its prospective applications in cryogenic electronics and computing, enabling directional supercurrent transport. This phenomenon has been demonstrated across various superconducting platforms, which typically necessitate unconventional materials with broken spatial symmetries or external magnetic fields, posing scalability and integration challenges. This work introduces an innovative method to realize the superconducting diode effect by disrupting spatiotemporal symmetries in a conventional Josephson junction utilizing a biharmonic alternating-current (AC) drive signal. We achieve wireless modulation of the diode's polarity and efficiency with an antenna. Our findings indicate a diode efficiency reaching the ideal $100%$ over a broad frequency range, with a temperature resilience of up to 800 mK, and efficient AC signal rectification. This versatile and platform-independent superconducting diode signifies a promising component for advancing future superconducting digital electronics, including efficient logic gates, ultrafast switches, and dynamic half-wave supercurrent rectifiers.</description>

      <title>Visualizing a Terahertz Superfluid Plasmon in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.</description>

      <title>Oxygen-driven altermagnetic symmetry inducing d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates and nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of cuprate high-Tc superconductivity, numerous theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain its mechanism; Anderson's RVB picture [Science 235, 1196-1198, 1987] and U(1) gauge theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 503-506, 1996] motivate a minimal one-band view that largely integrates out oxygen. By contrast, altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. X 12, 040501, 2022] yields a d-wave-like k-space magnetic texture from alternatingly rotated nonmagnetic cages; La2CuO4 (the parent of a high-Tc cuprate) is a prototypical example. As a proof of principle, we show in La2CuO4 that an alternating local pairing potential on the two Cu sublattices (plus/minus s(r)) produces a nodal, d-wave-like Delta(k). As orthorhombic tilts are, however, not the driver (and even suppress superconductivity in nickelates; [Nature 621, 493, (2023)], we then show that the in-plane oxygen sublattice of CuO2/NiO2 layers, ubiquitous in cuprates and nickelates, intrinsically realizes the same symmetry. Imposing an oxygen-centered, staggered s pairing yields a d-wave gap with perfect C4 symmetry, demonstrated self-consistently in NdNiO2 from first principles. While the underlying mechanism that drives this order is unclear, we outline possible origins. Further, this description of superconductivity enables mapping a real-space superconducting order parameter onto a lattice picture, allowing superconductivity and Hubbard physics to be treated on the same footing.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an SU(2)xU(1) genralization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary charge current and the spin current of the magnons), and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid in the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by correctly accounting for superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In the literature, this vorticity term incompletely manifests as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation within the relevant expansion scheme, accompanied by field redefinitions. The components discarded in this truncation are critical for restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, encapsulating both systems in the same master Lagrangian. Beyond clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism allows for solving the bosonic system in the lowest Landau level (LLL) by analogy. Specifically, we show that, in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical when the vortex crystal is reformulated using an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified perspective on these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</description>

      <title>Doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a non-equilibrium aspect of the current-driven superconducting-normal phase transition in floating Al islands of epitaxial full-shell Al/InAs nanowires. Within a transition region discontinuous voltage jumps and hysteretic behaviour of the I-V characteristics are observed, associated with the destruction and recovery of the superconducting order parameter in the island. The strength of the two features varies strongly in different devices in a mutually correlated way and can be suppressed by a small magnetic field. Numerical calculation explains this behaviour in terms of a tiny non-equilibrium correction to the electronic energy distribution at low energies. The experiment demonstrates a critical failure of a two-temperature non-equilibrium model of the superconductor-normal transition in floating islands of hybrid nanowire devices.</description>
