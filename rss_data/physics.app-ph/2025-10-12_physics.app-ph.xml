      <title>Passivation-Free Ga-Polar AlGaN/GaN Recessed-Gate HEMTs on Sapphire with 2.8 W/mm POUT and 26.8% PAE at 94 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a passivation-free Ga-polar recessed-gate AlGaN/GaN HEMT on a sapphire substrate for W-band operation, featuring a 5.5 nm Al0.35Ga0.65N barrier under the gate and a 31 nm Al0.35Ga0.65N barrier in the gate access regions. The device achieves a drain current density of 1.8 A/mm, a peak transconductance of 750 mS/mm, and low gate leakage with a high on/off ratio of 10^7. Small-signal characterization reveals a current-gain cutoff frequency of 127 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency of 203 GHz. Continuous-wave load-pull measurements at 94 GHz demonstrate an output power density of 2.8 W/mm with 26.8% power-added efficiency (PAE), both of which represent the highest values reported for Ga-polar GaN HEMTs on sapphire substrates and are comparable to state-of-the-art Ga-polar GaN HEMTs on SiC substrates. Considering the low cost of sapphire, the simplicity of the epitaxial design, and the reduced fabrication complexity relative to N-polar devices, this work highlights the potential of recessed-gate Ga-polar AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on sapphire as a promising candidate for next-generation millimeter-wave power applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics and Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou Recurrences in Macroscopic Ultra-low Loss Levitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic systems, when governed by nonlinear interactions, can display rich behavior from persistent oscillations to signatures of ergodicity breaking. Nonlinearity, long regarded as a nuisance in precision systems, is increasingly recognized as a gateway to new physical regimes. While such dynamics have been extensively studied in optics and atomic physics, macroscopic systems are rarely associated with long-lived coherence and nonlinear control and remain an untapped platform for probing the fundamental nonlinear processes. Here, we report the observation of long-lived oscillatory dynamics in millimeter-scale levitated dielectric quartz particles exhibiting clear signatures of nonlinear mode coupling, a positive largest Lyapunov exponent of 0.0095 s^-1, and partial energy recurrences-phenomena strongly reminiscent of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou physics. We observe dissipation rates below 4*10E-6 Hz, limited by our ability to measure dissipation in presence of nonlinear dynamics. We estimate an intrinsic acceleration sensitivity of 62*10E-12 g/sqrt(Hz), at room temperature. The magnetic trap is constructed from a static arrangement of permanent magnets, requiring no external power or active feedback. Our findings open a path toward leveraging nonlinear dynamics for novel applications in sensing, signal processing, and statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Self-Resetting Soft Ring Enables Autonomous and Continuous Leaping under Uniform Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jumping is an efficient locomotion strategy to traverse cluttered, uneven, or unstable environments in nature, yet replicating continuous, autonomous leaping in soft robots remains challenging due to limited energy storage and reliance on human intervention or latches. Here, we report a millimeter-scale, self-resetting soft ring that achieves repeated vertical and stable horizontal leaps under uniform infrared illumination without external control. The ring-shaped liquid crystal elastomer body twists to store elastic energy, which is suddenly released when a rigid tail strikes the ground, propelling the robot. During the airborne phase, the twisted body autonomously untwists, resetting for the next cycle. By tuning geometric asymmetry and the center of mass, the robot transitions between crawling, directional leaping, and vertical jumping. Optimized configurations yield vertical jumps exceeding 80 body heights and directional horizontal leaps over 3 body lengths. Beyond controlled motion on flat ground, the robot demonstrates resilient and robust locomotion across slopes, parallel hurdles, and diverse cluttered natural terrains including grass, wet sand, and mulch. This work establishes a new paradigm of twisting-enabled, photothermally powered soft robots capable of autonomous, continuous leaping, with potential applications in environmental navigation, swarm robotics, and unstructured terrain navigation.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Topotomography Using Small Intragranular Strain Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topo-Tomography (TT) is a synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction imaging technique used to characterize grain shape and crystal orientation in polycrystalline samples. This work aims to provide a decisive and fundamental understanding of 3D grain shape and orientation field reconstruction from TT diffraction data. We derive mathematical expressions for the TT projection geometry, considering grain shape, intragranular lattice rotations, and elastic strains, under the assumption of kinematical diffraction. These expressions are simplified using approximations for small strain variations and grain size. The simplified expressions show that integrated TT projection images correspond to projections of a "pseudo" distorted grain volume. Its Fourier analysis provides insights into the feasibility of orientation field reconstruction from TT scans. We propose methods to expand data coverage, including using opposite scattering vectors and varying detector distance. A lower bound for orientation sampling resolution is derived and validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>A pilot cohort study of a microfluidic-based point-of-care bilirubin measurement system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective The concentration of bilirubin in blood or serum is useful for assessing liver function as well as monitoring treatment. This study evaluates the clinical performance of a novel point-of-care (PoC) device for the detection of bilirubin in serum. The PoC device incorporates an integrated miniature optoelectronic sensing module and a microfluidic test cartridge.
  Methods Patients' serum total bilirubin concentrations, ranging from 2 {\mu}mol/L to 480 {\mu}mol/L, were measured using the PoC device and the standard laboratory method (n=20). Bland-Altman analysis and regression analysis using Passing-Bablok method were used to benchmark the PoC device against the standard laboratory measurements. The diagnostic capability of the PoC device in categorising the serum samples within clinically relevant bilirubin concentration thresholds of 200, 300, and 450 {\mu}mol/L was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
  Results The mean difference between the PoC device and the standard laboratory method was -5.6 {\mu}mol/L, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -45.1 {\mu}mol/L to 33.9 {\mu}mol/L. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.986. The PoC device achieved a detection sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 97% in categorising bilirubin concentrations within bands used in clinical decision-making.
  Conclusions This study demonstrates that the proposed PoC device is capable of measuring bilirubin levels in patient samples with clinically acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Acousto-optic lens for 3D shuttling of atoms in a neutral atom quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel acousto-optic lens (AOL) design for neutral atom quantum computing. This approach enhances atom rearrangement in optical tweezer arrays and addresses the speed limitations imposed by the cylindrical lensing effect of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). By combining a double-pass AOD configuration for dynamic focal tuning with a standard pair of crossed AODs for transverse beam steering, our design enables the generation of arbitrary focal point trajectories. This configuration enables shuttling of atoms in 3D space, thereby helping to realise fully connected two-qubit gates and mid-circuit measurements. We detail the optical implementation, characterize its performance, and discuss its applications in scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Toggling stiffness via multistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials enable unconventional and programmable mechanical responses through structural design rather than material composition. In this work, we introduce a multistable mechanical metamaterial that exhibits a toggleable stiffness effect, where the effective shear stiffness switches discretely between stable configurations. The mechanical analysis of surrogate beam models of the unit cell reveal that this behavior originates from the rotation transmitted by the support beams to the curved beam, which governs the balance between bending and axial deformation. The stiffness ratio between the two states of the unit cell can be tuned by varying the slenderness of the support beams or by incorporating localized hinges that modulate rotational transfer. Experiments on 3D-printed prototypes validate the numerical predictions, confirming consistent stiffness toggling across different geometries. Finally, we demonstrate a monolithic soft clutch that leverages this effect to achieve programmable, stepwise stiffness modulation. This work establishes a design strategy for toggleable stiffness using multistable metamaterials, paving the way for adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous systems in soft robotics and smart structures.</description>

      <title>Optimal Binning for Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Data Using the Freedman-Diaconis Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) data analysis often relies on fixed-width binning schemes that overlook variations in signal strength and structural complexity. We introduce a statistically grounded approach based on the Freedman-Diaconis (FD) rule, which minimizes the mean integrated squared error between the histogram estimate and the true intensity distribution. By deriving the competing scaling relations for counting noise ($\propto h^{-1}$) and binning distortion ($\propto h^{2}$), we establish an optimal bin width that balances statistical precision and structural resolution. Application to synthetic data from the Debye scattering function of a Gaussian polymer chain demonstrates that the FD criterion quantitatively determines the most efficient binning, faithfully reproducing the curvature of $I(Q)$ while minimizing random error. The optimal width follows the expected scaling $h_{\mathrm{opt}} \propto N_{\mathrm{total}}^{-1/3}$, delineating the transition between noise- and resolution-limited regimes. This framework provides a unified, physics-informed basis for adaptive, statistically efficient binning in neutron scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic-Field-Based Circuit Theory and Charge-Flux-Flow Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the general circuit equations and system models directly from four Maxwell's equations and develop the electric-charge-based and magnetic-flux-based analysis methodologies to unify the analyses for both phase-independent circuits such as resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuits and semiconductor transistor circuits, and phase-dependent circuits such as Josephson junction circuits and quantum-phase-slip (QPS) junction circuits. We invent the electric-charge-flow (ECF) diagram and the magnetic-flux-flow (MFF) diagram to abstract electric circuits into electric-charge-pump (ECP) networks and magnetic-flux-pump (MFP) networks, and visualize the dynamics of charge and flux distributions in electric circuits. The ECF and MFF diagrams are the graphic expressions of the system models of electric circuits, which can be directly simulated through solving general circuit equations. They are novel graphic languages for electromagnetic field-based circuit design and analysis.</description>
