      <title>Existence and regularity for perturbed Stokes system with critical drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the existence and $L^q$ gradient estimates for perturbed Stokes systems with divergence-free critical drift in a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \ge 3$. The first two results assume the drift is either in $L^n$ or sufficiently small in weak $L^n$. The third result assumes the drift is in weak $L^n$ without smallness, and obtain results for $q$ close to 2.</description>

      <title>Non Existence and Strong Ill-Posedness in $H^2$ for the Stable IPM Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the non-existence and strong ill-posedness of the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) equation for initial data that are small $H^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ perturbations of the linearly stable profile $-x_2$. A remarkable novelty of the proof is the construction of an $H^2$ perturbation, which solves the IPM equation and neutralizes the stabilizing effect of the background profile near the origin, where a strong deformation leading to non-existence in $H^2$ is created. This strong deformation is achieved through an iterative procedure inspired by the work of C\'{o}rdoba and Mart\'{\i}nez-Zoroa (Adv. Math. 2022). However, several differences - beyond purely technical aspects - arise due to the anisotropic and, more importantly, to the partially dissipative nature of the equation, adding further challenges to the analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectral estimates on hyperbolic surfaces and a necessary condition for observability of the heat semigroup on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a continuation of arXiv:2401.14977. We study the concentration properties of spectral projectors on manifolds, in connection with the uncertainty principle. In arXiv:2401.14977, the second author proved an optimal uncertainty principle for the spectral projector of the Laplacian on the hyperbolic half-plane. The aim of the present work is to generalize this condition to surfaces with hyperbolic ends. In particular, we tackle the case of cusps, in which the volume of balls of fixed radius is not bounded from below. We establish that spectral estimates hold from sets satisfying a thickness condition, with a proof based on propagation of smallness estimates of Carleman and Logunov--Malinnikova type. We also prove the converse, namely the necessary character of the thickness condition, on any smooth manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below.</description>

      <title>Qualitative properties of the spreading speed of a population structured in space and in phenotype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal Fisher-KPP equation that models a population structured in space and in phenotype. The population lives in a heterogeneous periodic environment: the diffusion coefficient, the mutation coefficient and the fitness of an individual may depend on its spatial position and on its phenotype.
  We first prove a Freidlin-G\"artner formula for the spreading speed of the population. We then study the behaviour of the spreading speed in different scaling limits (small and large period, small and large mutation coefficient). Finally, we exhibit new phenomena arising thanks to the phenotypic dimension. Our results are also valid when the phenotype is seen as another spatial variable along which the population does not spread.</description>

      <title>Surfactants in a Non-local Model for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of surfactants on stabilizing the formation of interfaces in non-local anisotropic two-phase fluid at equilibrium. The analysis focuses on singularly perturbed non-local van der Waals-Cahn-Hillard-type energies, supplemented with a term that accounts for the interaction between the surfactant and the fluid. We derive by Gamma-convergence the effective surface tension model as the thickness of the transition layer vanishes and show that it decreases when the surfactant segregates to the interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our series devoted, after references \cite{CM24D1} and \cite{CM243}, at proving the asymptotic stability of ground states of the pure power Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the line. Here we assume some results on the spectrum of the linearization obtained computationally by Chang et al. \cite{Chang} and then we explore the equation for exponents $p\le 2$ sufficiently close to 2. The ensuing loss of regularity of the nonlinearity requires new arguments.</description>

      <title>On incompressible flows in discrete networks and Shnirelman's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be two volume-preserving diffeomorphisms on the cube $Q=[0,1]^{\nu}$, $\nu \geq 3$. We show that there is a divergence-free vector field $v \in L^1((0,1);L^p(Q))$ such that $v$ connects $f$ and $g$ through the corresponding flow and $\Vert v \Vert_{L^1_t L^p_x} \leq C_{p,\nu} \Vert f- g \Vert_{L^p_x}$. In particular we show Shnirelman's inequality, cf. [Shnirelman, Generalized fluid flows, their approximation and applications (1994)], for the optimal H\"older exponent $\alpha =1$, thus proving that the metric on the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of $Q$ is equivalent to the $L^2$-distance. To achieve this, we discretise our problem, use some results on flows in discrete networks and then construct a flow in non-discrete space-time out of the discrete solution.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for the free boundary barotropic fluid model in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of general relativity, the dynamics of a general barotropic fluid are coupled to the Einstein equations, which govern the structure of the underlying spacetime. We establish a priori estimates and well-posedness in Sobolev spaces for this model with a free boundary. Within the frame parallel-transported by the fluid velocity, we decompose the fluid and geometric quantities. The fluid components are estimated via a coupled interior-boundary wave equation, while the geometric quantities are analyzed through the Bianchi equations. Compared to a previous work, the results in present paper allow general equations of state and non-zero vorticities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Krylov-Safonov type H\"older regularity theory for solutions to quite general discrete dynamic programming equations or equivalently discrete stochastic processes on random geometric graphs. Such graphs arise for example from data clouds in graph-based machine learning. The results actually hold to functions satisfying Pucci-type extremal inequalities, and thus we cover many examples including tug-of-war games on random geometric graphs. As an application we show that under suitable assumptions when the number of data points increases, the graph functions converge to a solution of a partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary distribution for kinetic SDEs with low regularity coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider kinetic SDEs with low regularity coefficients in the setting recently introduced in [6]. For the solutions to such equations, we first prove a Harnack inequality. Using the abstract approach of [5], this inequality then allows us to prove, under a Lyapunov condition, the existence and uniqueness (in a suitable class of measures) of a quasi-stationary distribution in cylindrical domains of the phase space. We finally exhibit two settings in which the Lyapunov condition holds: general kinetic SDEs in domains which are bounded in position, and Langevin processes with a non-conservative force and a suitable growth condition on the force.</description>

      <title>H-DES: a Quantum-Classical Hybrid Differential Equation Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an original hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on a variational quantum algorithm for solving systems of differential equations. The algorithm relies on a spectral method, which involves encoding the solution functions in the amplitudes of the quantum states generated by different parametrized circuits and transforms the task of solving the differential equations into an optimization problem. We first describe the principle of the algorithm from a theoretical point of view. We provide a detailed pseudo-code of the algorithm, on which we conduct a complexity analysis to highlight its scaling properties. We apply it to a set of examples, showcasing its applicability across diverse sets of differential equations. We discuss the advantages of our method and potential avenues for further exploration and refinement.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Finite Element Method for Phase Field Fracture Models Based on Recovery Error Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase field model is a widely used mathematical approach for describing crack propagation in continuum damage fractures. In the context of phase field fracture simulations, adaptive finite element methods (AFEM) are often employed to address the mesh size dependency of the model. However, existing AFEM approaches for this application frequently rely on heuristic adjustments and empirical parameters for mesh refinement. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive finite element method based on a recovery type posteriori error estimates approach grounded in theoretical analysis. This method transforms the gradient of the numerical solution into a smoother function space, using the difference between the recovered gradient and the original numerical gradient as an error indicator for adaptive mesh refinement. This enables the automatic capture of crack propagation directions without the need for empirical parameters. We have implemented this adaptive method for the Hybrid formulation of the phase field model using the open-source software package FEALPy. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulations of classical 2D and 3D brittle fracture examples, validating the robustness and effectiveness of our implementation.</description>

      <title>Green function for $T_\alpha$-Laplacian in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through this article we will use a notation
  \begin{equation}\label{alfaLap} T_{\alpha}u(x)=(1-|x|^2)\Delta u(x)+2 \alpha \langle x,\nabla u(x)\rangle + (n-2-\alpha) \alpha u(x). \end{equation}
  Here, $|x|&lt;1$ and $\alpha&gt;-1$. Also, for $x=x(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\in \mathbb{R}^n$ we use $|x|=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\ldots+x_n^2}, \nabla =(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1},\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}),\Delta=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_1^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_2^2}+\ldots+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_n^2}.$
  The purpose of this paper is to investigate a Dirichlet problem, corresponding to above mentioned PDE. We will specificaly consider non-homogenous boundary value problem. In that purpose the explicit formula for Green function assosiated to the operator (\ref{alfaLap}) will be calculated, and also, we will present the corresponding representation theorem.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Scattering Theory for Asymptotically de Sitter Vacuum Solutions in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a definitive quantitative nonlinear scattering theory for asymptotically de Sitter solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations in $(n+1)$ dimensions with $n\geq4$ even, which are determined by small scattering data at the spacelike asymptotic boundaries $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+.$ The case of even spatial dimension $n$ poses significant challenges compared to its odd counterpart and was left open by the previous works in the literature. Here, scattering theory is understood to mean existence and uniqueness of scattering states, asymptotic completeness, and the existence of an invertible scattering map with quantitative control on its norm. The existence and uniqueness of scattering states imply that for any small asymptotic data there exists a unique global solution to the Einstein equations, which remains close to the de Sitter metric. Asymptotic completeness is the converse statement, showing that any such solution induces asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and at $\mathscr{I}^+.$ For sufficiently small asymptotic data, we construct the scattering map $\mathscr{S}$ taking data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ to data at $\mathscr{I}^+,$ and we show that the map $\mathscr{S}$ is locally invertible and locally Lipschitz at the de Sitter data, with respect to a Sobolev-type norm.
  The scattering map result is sharp and avoids any "derivative loss", in the sense that we measure the smallness of asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$ using the same Sobolev norm. The proof of the sharp result requires a detailed analysis of the Einstein equations involving a geometric Littlewood-Paley decomposition of the solution, carried out in our companion paper.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions of the Koopman--von Neumann Equation on Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman--von Neumann equation describes the evolution of a complex-valued wavefunction corresponding to the probability distribution given by an associated classical Liouville equation. Typically, it is defined on the whole Euclidean space. The investigation of bounded domains, particularly in practical scenarios involving quantum-based simulations of dynamical systems, has received little attention so far. We consider the Koopman--von Neumann equation associated with an ordinary differential equation on a bounded domain whose trajectories are contained in the set's closure. Our main results are the construction of a strongly continuous semigroup together with the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the associated initial value problem. To this end, a functional-analytic framework connected to Sobolev spaces is proposed and analyzed. Moreover, the connection of the Koopman--von Neumann framework to transport equations is highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of surfactants on stabilizing the formation of interfaces in solid-solid phase transitions. The analysis focuses on singularly perturbed van der Waals-Cahn-Hillard-type energies for gradient vector fields, supplemented with a term that accounts for the interaction between the surfactant and the solid. Assuming the potential term to have only two rank-one connected wells, we prove that the effective energy for the formation of an interface decreases when the surfactant segregate to the interface.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions for the compressible Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (PNPNS) system of equations, governing the transport of charged particles under the influence of the self-consistent electrostatic potential, in a three-dimensional bounded domain. We prove the existence of global weak solutions for the initial-boundary value problem with no-slip boundary condition for the fluid's velocity, blocking boundary condition for the ionic concentrations and inhomogeneous Robin boundary condition for the electrostatic potential, without restrictions on the size of the initial data. We derive the crucial energy dissipation of the system and prove the weak sequential stability of solutions of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck subsystem with respect to the velocity field of the fluid, which enables the proof of the existence of global weak solutions for the PNPNS system. We also study the large-time behavior of the solutions and justify the incompressible limit of the compressible PNPNS system as applications of the weak sequential stability of the solutions. New techniques and estimates are developed to overcome the difficulties from the strong interaction of the fluid with the ion particles and the physical boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to investigate the concentration properties of spectral projectors on manifolds. This question has been intensively studied (by Logvinenko--Sereda, Nazarov, Jerison--Lebeau, Kovrizhkin, Egidi--Seelmann--Veseli{\'c}, Burq--Moyano, among others) in connection with the uncertainty principle. We provide the first high-frequency results in a geometric setting which is neither Euclidean nor a perturbation of Euclidean. Namely, we prove the natural (and optimal) uncertainty principle for the spectral projector on the hyperbolic half-plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical and biochemical reactions can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors, including multiple steady states, oscillatory patterns, and chaotic dynamics. These phenomena have captivated researchers for many decades. Notable examples of oscillating chemical systems include the Briggs--Rauscher, Belousov--Zhabotinskii, and Bray--Liebhafsky reactions, where periodic variations in concentration are often visualized through observable color changes. These systems are typically modeled by a set of partial differential equations coupled through nonlinear interactions.
  Upon closer analysis, it appears that the dynamics of these chemical/biochemical reactions may be governed by only a finite number of spatial Fourier modes. We can also draw the same conclusion in fluid dynamics, where it has been shown that, over long periods, the fluid velocity is determined by a finite set of Fourier modes, referred to as determining modes. In this article, we introduce the concept of determining modes for a two-species chemical models, which covers models such as the Brusselator, the Gray-Scott model, and the Glycolysis model \cite{ashkenazi1978spatial,segel1980mathematical}. We demonstrate that it is indeed sufficient to characterize the dynamic of the model using only a finite number of spatial Fourier modes.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic stability on the line of ground states of the pure power NLS with $0&lt;|p-3|\ll 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For exponents $p$ satisfying $0&lt;|p-3|\ll 1$ and only in the context of spatially even solutions we prove that the ground states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with pure power nonlinearity of exponent $p$ in the line are asymptotically stable. The proof is similar to a related result of Martel, preprint arXiv:2312.11016, for a cubic quintic NLS. Here we modify the second part of Martel's argument, replacing the second virial inequality for a transformed problem with a smoothing estimate on the initial problem, appropriately tamed by multiplying the initial variables and equations by a cutoff.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions by transport noise of 3D Navier-Stokes equations with small hyperviscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of global smooth solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with hyperviscosity $(-\Delta)^{\gamma}$ is open unless $\gamma $ is close to the J.-L. Lions exponent $ \frac{5}{4}$ at which the energy balance is strong enough to prevent singularity formation. If $1&lt;\gamma \ll \frac{5}{4}$, then the global well-posedness of the hyperviscous NSEs is widely open as for the usual NSEs. In this paper, for all $\gamma&gt;1$, we show the existence of a transport noise for which global smooth solutions to the stochastic hyperviscous NSEs on the three-dimensional torus exist with high probability. In particular, a suitable transport noise considerably improves the known well-posedness results in the deterministic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09100v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Sobolev inequality on noncommutative Euclidean spaces. As a simple consequence, we obtain the Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality and as its application we show global well-posedness of nonlinear PDEs in the noncommutative Euclidean space. Moreover, we show that the logarithmic Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the Nash inequality for possibly different constants in this noncommutative setting by completing the list in noncommutative Varopoulos's theorem in [37]. Finally, we present a direct application of the Nash inequality to compute the time decay for solutions of the heat equation in the noncommutative setting.</description>

      <title>The radiation condition for Helmholtz equations above (locally perturbed) periodic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation condition is the key question in the mathematical modelling for scattering problems in unbounded domains. Mathematically, it plays the role as the "boundary condition" at the infinity, which guarantees the well-posedness of the mathematical problem; physically, it describes the far-field asymptotic behaviour of the physical waves. In this paper, we focus on the radiation conditions for scattering problems above (locally perturbed) periodic surfaces. According to Hu et al. (2021), the radiating solution satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}-i k u=o(r^{-1/2}).$$
  Although there are literature which have studied this problem, there is no specific method for dealing with periodic structures. Due to this reason, the important properties for the periodic structures may be ignored. Moreover, the existing method is not extendable to bi-periodic structures in three dimensional spaces.
  In this paper, we study the radiation condition for the time-harmonic scattering problem with periodic surfaces, which is modelled by the Helmholtz equation. We introduce a novel method based on the Floquet-Bloch transform, which, to the best of the author's knowledge, is the first method that works particularly for periodic media. With this method, we improve the Sommerfeld radiation condition for the scattered field from periodic media to: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}-i k u=O(r^{-3/2}).$$ More importantly, the prospect of extending this method to 3D cases is optimistic.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Caratheodory Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0851</link>
      <description>arXiv:0808.0851v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Caratheodory states that the number of umbilic points on a closed convex surface in ${\mathbb E}^3$ must be greater than one. In this paper we prove this for $C^{3+\alpha}$-smooth surfaces. The Conjecture is first reformulated in terms of complex points on a Lagrangian surface in $TS^2$, viewed as the space of oriented geodesics in ${\mathbb E}^3$. Here complex and Lagrangian refer to the canonical neutral Kaehler structure on $TS^2$. We then prove that the existence of a closed convex surface with only one umbilic point implies the existence of a totally real Lagrangian hemisphere in $TS^2$, to which it is not possible to attach the edge of a holomorphic disc. The main step in the proof is to establish the existence of a holomorphic disc with edge contained on any given totally real Lagrangian hemisphere. To construct the holomorphic disc we utilize mean curvature flow with respect to the neutral metric. Long-time existence of this flow is proven by a priori estimates and we show that the flowing disc is asymptotically holomorphic. Existence of a holomorphic disc is then deduced from Schauder estimates.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility via neural fields of visual illusions induced by localized stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the modeling of experiments conducted by Billock and Tsou [V. A. Billock and B. H. Tsou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 104 (2007), pp. 8490--8495] using an Amari-type neural field that models the average membrane potential of neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The study specifically focuses on a regular funnel pattern localized in the fovea or the peripheral visual field. It aims to comprehend and model the visual phenomena induced by this pattern, emphasizing their nonlinear nature. The research involves designing sensory inputs that mimic the visual stimuli from Billock and Tsou's experiments. The cortical outputs induced by these sensory inputs are then theoretically and numerically studied to assess their ability to model the experimentally observed visual effects at the V1 level. A crucial aspect of this study is the exploration of the effects induced by the nonlinear nature of neural responses. By highlighting the significance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the emergence of these visual phenomena, the research suggests that an interplay of both types of neuronal activities plays a crucial role in visual processes, challenging the assumption that the latter is primarily driven by excitatory activities alone.</description>

      <title>Multi-component multi-scale hydrodynamic plasma flow models in mechanical and thermal disequilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work is motivated by the mixing mechanism in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), which remarkably degrades the ignition performance. The mixing is a direct result of velocity disequilibrium and affected by temperature disequilibrium.To deal with these disequilibria, we propose a fully-disequilibrium hydrodynamic model (termed as Baer-Nunziato-Zeldovich model or BNZ model) with 9 equations, 4 temperatures (two for ions, and two for electrons), 4 pressures (two for ions, and two for electrons) and 2 ion velocities for two-component dense plasma flows. The model can be used for describing both grain and atomic mixing by choosing corresponding relaxation mechanism. The derivation starts from a multi-component conservative entropy-dissipative Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model to obtain a 14-equation model. It is then reduced to more practical 9-equation BNZ model and further to simpler 8-equation model, 6-equation model (the Kapila-Zeldovich model or the KZ model), and the 5-equation model. The reductions are performed on the basis of various relaxation time evaluations, the plasma neutrality and the smallness of the electron mass. The models are thermodynamics-compatible, and capable of dealing with mechanical and thermal disequilibria at both atomic and grain scales. Moreover, the corresponding hydrodynamic subsystems are shown to be hyperbolic and solved with the Godunov finite volume method. The BNZ model and solution methods are verified and validated by some benchmark problems and 1D-2D comparisons. We then consider the velocity, pressure and temperature disequilibria during the passage of an ablation shock in ICF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric significance of Leinster's magnitude invariant. For closed manifolds we find a precise relation with Brylinski's beta function and therefore with classical invariants of knots and submanifolds. In the special case of compact homogeneous spaces we obtain an elementary proof that the residues of the beta function contain the same geometric information as the asymptotic expansion of the magnitude function. For general closed manifolds we use the recent pseudodifferential analysis of the magnitude operator to relate these via an interpolating polynomial family. Beyond manifolds, the relation with the Brylinski beta function allows to deduce unexpected properties of the magnitude function for the $p$-adic integers.</description>
