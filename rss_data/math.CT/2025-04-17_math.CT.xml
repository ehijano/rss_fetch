      <title>What is a monoid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many situations one encounters a notion that resembles that of a monoid. It consists of a carrier and two operations that resemble a unit and a multiplication, subject to three equations that resemble associativity and left and right unital laws. The question then arises whether this notion in fact that of a monoid in a suitable sense. Category theorists have answered this question by providing a notion of monoid in a monoidal category, or more generally in a multicategory. While this encompasses many examples, it is unsuitable in other cases, such as the notion of relative monad, and the modelling of call-by-push-value sequencing. In each of these examples, the leftmost and/or the rightmost factor of a multiplication or associativity law seems to be distinguished. To include such examples, we generalize the multicategorical framework in two stages. Firstly, we move to the framework of a left-skew multicategory (due to Bourke and Lack), which generalizes both multicategory and left-skew monoidal category. The notion of monoid in this framework encompasses examples where only the leftmost factor is distinguished, such as the notion of relative monad. Secondly, we consider monoids in the novel framework of a bi-skew multicategory. This encompasses examples where both the leftmost and the rightmost factor are distinguished, such as the notion of a category on a span, and the modelling of call-by-push-value sequencing. In the bi-skew framework (which is the most general), we give a coherence result saying that a monoid corresponds to an unbiased monoid, i.e. a map from the unit bi-skew multicategory.</description>

      <title>The Topological Structures of the Orders of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide first a categorical exploration of, and then completion of the mapping of the relationships among, three fundamental perspectives on binary relations: as the incidence matrices of hypergraphs, as the formal contexts of concept lattices, and as specifying topological cosheaves of simplicial (Dowker) complexes on simplicial (Dowker) complexes. We provide an integrative, functorial framework combining previously known with three new results: 1) given a binary relation, there are order isomorphisms among the bounded edge order of the intersection complexes of its dual hypergraphs and its concept lattice; 2) the concept lattice of a context is an isomorphism invariant of the Dowker cosheaf (of abstract simplicial complexes) of that context; and 3) a novel Dowker cosheaf (of chain complexes) of a relation is an isomorphism invariant of the concept lattice of the context that generalizes Dowker's original homological result. We illustrate these concepts throughout with a running example, and demonstrate relationships to past results.</description>

      <title>Representability theorems via metric techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove new Brown representability theorems for triangulated categories using metric techniques as introduced in the work of Neeman. In the setting of algebraic geometry, this gives us new representability theorems for homological and cohomological functors on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves. To prove this result, we introduce a generalisation of the notion of an approximable triangulated category.</description>

      <title>Admissible subcategories and metric techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a way of constructing new semiorthogonal decompositions using metric techniques (\`a la Neeman). Given a semiorthogonal decomposition on a category with a special kind of metric, which we call a compressible metric, we can construct new semiorthogonal decomposition on a category constructed from the given one using the aforementioned metric. In the algebro-geometric setting, this gives us a way of producing new semiorthogonal decompositions on various small triangulated categories associated to a scheme, if we are given one. In the general setting, the work is related to that of Sun-Zhang, while its applications to algebraic geometry are related to the work of Bondarko and Kuznetsov-Shinder.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Extension of Intuitionistic Linear Logic: The $L_!^S$-Calculus and Its Categorical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $L_!^S$-calculus, a linear lambda-calculus extended with scalar multiplication and term addition, that acts as a proof language for intuitionistic linear logic (ILL). These algebraic operations enable the direct expression of linearity at the syntactic level, a property not typically available in standard proof-term calculi. Building upon previous work, we develop the $L_!^S$-calculus as an extension of the $L^S$-calculus with the $!$ modality. We prove key meta-theoretical properties--subject reduction, confluence, strong normalisation, and an introduction property--as well as preserve the expressiveness of the original $L^S$-calculus, including the encoding of vectors and matrices, and the correspondence between proof-terms and linear functions. A denotational semantics is provided in the framework of linear categories with biproducts, ensuring a sound and adequate interpretation of the calculus. This work is part of a broader programme aiming to build a measurement-free quantum programming language grounded in linear logic.</description>

      <title>Categories of hypermagmas, hypergroups, and related hyperstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to diagnose the cause of some defects in the category of canonical hypergroups, we investigate several categories of hyperstructures that generalize hypergroups. By allowing hyperoperations with possibly empty products, one obtains categories with desirable features such as completeness and cocompleteness, free functors, regularity, and closed monoidal structures. We show by counterexamples that such constructions cannot be carried out within the category of canonical hypergroups. This suggests that (commutative) unital, reversible hypermagmas -- which we call mosaics -- form a worthwhile generalization of (canonical) hypergroups from the categorical perspective. Notably, mosaics contain pointed simple matroids as a subcategory, and projective geometries as a full subcategory.</description>

      <title>Itegories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An itegory is a restriction category with a Kleene wand. Cockett, D\'iaz-Bo\"ils, Gallagher, and Hrube\v{s} briefly introduced Kleene wands to capture iteration in restriction categories arising from complexity theory. The purpose of this paper is to develop in more detail the theory of Kleene wands and itegories.
  A Kleene wand is a binary operator which takes in two disjoint partial maps, an endomorphism ${X \to X}$ and a map ${X \to A}$ and produces a partial map $X \to A$. This latter map is interpreted as iterating the endomorphism until it lands in the domain of definition of the second map. In a setting with infinite disjoint joins, there is always a canonical Kleene wand given by realizing this intuition.
  The standard categorical interpretation of iteration is via trace operators on coproducts. For extensive restriction categories, we explain in detail how having a Kleene wand is equivalent to this standard interpretation of iteration. This suggests that Kleene wands can be used to replace parametrized iteration and traces in restriction categories which lack coproducts. Further evidence of this is exhibited by providing a matrix construction which embeds an itegory into a traced extensive restriction category. We also consider Kleene wands in classical restriction categories and show how, in this case, a Kleene wand is completely determined by its endomorphism component.</description>
