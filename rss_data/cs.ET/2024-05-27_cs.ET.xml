      <title>ReStorEdge: An edge computing system with reuse semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an edge computing system where requests are processed by a set of replicated edge servers. We investigate a class of applications where similar queries produce identical results. To reduce processing overhead on the edge servers we store the results of previous computations and return them when new queries are sufficiently similar to earlier ones that produced the results, avoiding the necessity of processing every new query. We implement a similarity-based data classification system, which we evaluate based on real-world datasets of images and voice queries. We evaluate a range of orchestration strategies to distribute queries and cached results between edge nodes and show that the throughput of queries over a system of distributed edge nodes can be increased by 25-33%, increasing its capacity for higher workloads.</description>

      <title>Cypher4BIM: Releasing the Power of Graph for Building Knowledge Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph is considered a promising way for managing building information. A new graphic form of IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data has just been developed, referred to as IFC-Graph. However, understanding of IFC-Graph is insufficient, especially for information query. This study aims to explore graphic building information query and develop a graph query language tailored for IFC-Graph. A series of tasks were carried out, including a) investigating the structure of IFC data and the main types of information in IFC, b) investigating the graph query language Cypher, and c) developing a set of tailored functional query patterns. The developed language is referred to as Cypher4BIM. Five IFC models were used for validation, and the result shows that Cypher4BIM can query individual instances and complex relations from IFC, such as spatial structure, space boundary, and space accessibility. This study contributes to applications that require effective building information query, such as digital twin.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Diffusion on a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks have frequently envisioned the behavior of a quantum state traversing a classically defined, generally finite, graph structure. While this approach has already generated significant results, it imposes a strong assumption: all nodes where the walker is not positioned are quiescent. This paper will examine some mathematical structures that underlie state diffusion on arbitrary graphs, that is the circulation of states within a graph. We will seek to frame the multi-walker problem as a finite quantum cellular automaton. Every vertex holds a walker at all times. The walkers will never collide and at each time step their positions update non-deterministically by a quantum swap of walkers at opposite ends of a randomly chosen edge. The update is accomplished by a unitary transformation of the position of a walker to a superposition of all such possible swaps and then performing a quantum measurement on the superposition of possible swaps. This behavior generates strong entanglement between vertex states which provides a path toward developing local actions producing diffusion throughout the graph without depending on the specific structure of the graph through blind computation.</description>

      <title>Digitalization in Infrastructure Construction Projects: A PRISMA-Based Review of Benefits and Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study presents a comprehensive review of the benefits and barriers associated with the adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in infrastructure projects, focusing on the period from 2013 to 2023. The research explores the manifold advantages offered by BIM, spanning the entire project life cycle, including planning, design, construction, maintenance, and sustainability. Notably, BIM enhances collaboration, facilitates real-time data-driven decision-making, and leads to substantial cost and time savings. In parallel, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify and categorize the barriers hindering BIM adoption within the infrastructure industry. Eleven studies were selected for in-depth analysis, revealing a total of 74 obstacles. Through synthetic analysis and thematic clustering, seven primary impediments to BIM adoption were identified, encompassing challenges related to education/training, resistance to change, business value clarity, perceived cost, lack of standards and guidelines, lack of mandates, and lack of initiatives. This review explores the benefits and barriers in the industry that are facing BIM adoption in infrastructure projects, giving an important perspective toward improving effective BIM adoption strategies, policies, and standards. Future directions for research and industry development are outlined, including efforts to enhance education and training, promote standardization, advocate for policy and mandates, and integrate BIM with emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Coupling Light with Matter for Identifying Dominant Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel light-matter platform that uses complex-valued oscillator networks, a form of physical neural networks, to identify dominant subnetworks and uncover indirect correlations within larger networks. This approach offers significant advantages, including low energy consumption, high processing speed, and the immediate identification of co- and counter-regulated nodes without post-processing. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through its application to biological networks, and we also propose its applicability to a wide range of other network types.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Joule Losses in Memristive Switching Using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electricity production from fossil fuels is among the main contributors to global warming. To suppress climate change, energy-efficient systems, devices, and technologies must be implemented. This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Energy-Efficient Wireless Tire Sensing System with Delay Analysis for Intelligent Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to a rise in the popularity of intelligent vehicles that incorporate a range of sensors to monitor various aspects, such as driving speed, fuel usage, distance proximity and tire anomalies. Nowadays, real-time tire sensing systems play important roles for intelligent vehicles in increasing mileage, reducing fuel consumption, improving driving safety, and reducing the potential for traffic accidents. However, the current tire sensing system drains a significant vehicle' energy and lacks effective collection of sensing data, which may not guarantee the immediacy of driving safety. Thus, this paper designs an energy-efficient wireless tire sensing system (WTSS), which leverages energy-saving techniques to significantly reduce power consumption while ensuring data retrieval delays during real-time monitoring. Additionally, we mathematically analyze the worst-case transmission delay of the system to ensure the immediacy based on the collision probabilities of sensor transmissions. This system has been implemented and verified by the simulation and field trial experiments. These results show that the proposed scheme provides enhanced performance in energy efficiency and accurately identifies the worst transmission delay.</description>
