      <title>Cluster Decomposition for Improved Erasure Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new erasure decoder that applies to arbitrary quantum LDPC codes. Dubbed the cluster decoder, it generalizes the decomposition idea of Vertical-Horizontal (VH) decoding introduced by Connelly et al. in 2022. Like the VH decoder, the idea is to first run the peeling decoder and then post-process the resulting stopping set. The cluster decoder breaks the stopping set into a tree of clusters which can be solved sequentially via Gaussian Elimination (GE). By allowing clusters of unconstrained size, this decoder achieves maximum-likelihood (ML) performance with reduced complexity compared with full GE. When GE is applied only to clusters whose sizes are less than a constant, the performance is degraded but the complexity becomes linear in the block length. Our simulation results show that, for hypergraph product codes, the cluster decoder with constant cluster size achieves near-ML performance similar to VH decoding in the low-erasure-rate regime. For the general quantum LDPC codes we studied, the cluster decoder can be used to estimate the ML performance curve with reduced complexity over a wide range of erasure rates.</description>

      <title>Differential uniformity and costacyclic code from some power mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the differential properties of $x^d$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ with $d=p^{2l}-p^{l}+1$. By studying the differential equation of $x^d$ and the number of rational points on some curves over finite fields, we completely determine differential spectrum of $x^{d}$. Then we investigate the $c$-differential uniformity of $x^{d}$. We also calculate the value distribution of a class of exponential sum related to $x^d$. In addition, we obtain a class of six-weight consta-cyclic codes, whose weight distribution is explicitly determined. Part of our results is a complement of the works shown in [\ref{H1}, \ref{H2}] which mainly focus on cross correlations.</description>

      <title>An Informational Parsimony Perspective on Symmetry-Based Structure Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extraction of structure, in particular of group symmetries, is increasingly crucial to understanding and building intelligent models. In particular, some information-theoretic models of parsimonious learning have been argued to induce invariance extraction. Here, we formalise these arguments from a group-theoretic perspective. We then extend them to the study of more general probabilistic symmetries, through compressions preserving well-studied geometric measures of complexity. More precisely, we formalise a trade-off between compression and preservation of the divergence from a given hierarchical model, yielding a novel generalisation of the Information Bottleneck framework. Through appropriate choices of hierarchical models, we fully characterise (in the discrete and full support case) channel invariance, channel equivariance and distribution invariance under permutation. Allowing imperfect divergence preservation then leads to principled definitions of "soft symmetries", where the "coarseness" corresponds to the degree of compression of the system. In simple synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our method successively recovers, at increasingly compressed "resolutions", nested but increasingly perturbed equivariances, where new equivariances emerge at bifurcation points of the trade-off parameter. Our framework suggests a new path for the extraction of generalised probabilistic symmetries.</description>

      <title>MIMO Detection via Gaussian Mixture Expectation Propagation: A Bayesian Machine Learning Approach for High-Order High-Dimensional MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MIMO systems can simultaneously transmit multiple data streams within the same frequency band, thus exploiting the spatial dimension to enhance performance. MIMO detection poses considerable challenges due to the interference and noise introduced by the concurrent transmission of multiple streams. Efficient Uplink (UL) MIMO detection algorithms are crucial for decoding these signals accurately and ensuring robust communication. In this paper a MIMO detection algorithm is proposed which improves over the Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approximation for Belief Propagation (BP) and EP messages. The GMM messages better approximate the data prior when EP fails to do so and thus improve detection. This algorithm outperforms state of the art detection algorithms while maintaining low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Internet of Robotic Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, robotics, and Internet of Things, multi-robot systems are progressively acquiring human-like environmental perception and understanding capabilities, empowering them to complete complex tasks through autonomous decision-making and interaction. However, the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) faces significant challenges in terms of spectrum resources, sensing accuracy, communication latency, and energy supply. To address these issues, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided IoRT network is proposed to enhance the overall performance of robotic communication, sensing, computation, and energy harvesting. In the case studies, by jointly optimizing parameters such as transceiver beamforming, robot trajectories, and RIS coefficients, solutions based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and multi-objective optimization are proposed to solve problems such as beamforming design, path planning, target sensing, and data aggregation. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed solutions in improve communication quality, sensing accuracy, computation error, and energy efficiency of RIS-aided IoRT networks.</description>

      <title>On the metric mean dimensions of saturated sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Saturated sets and its reduced case the set of generic points are two types of important fractal-like sets in Multifractal analysis of dynamical systems. In the context of infinite entropy systems, this paper aims to give some qualitative aspects of saturated sets and the set generic points in both topological and measure-theoretic situations. For systems with specification property, we establish the certain variational principles for saturated sets in terms of Bowen and packing metric mean dimensions, and show the upper capacity metric mean dimension of saturated sets have full metric mean dimension. All results are useful for understanding the topological structures of dynamical systems with infinite topological entropy.
  As applications, we further exhibit some qualitative aspects of metric mean dimensions of level sets and the set of mean Li-Yorke pairs in infinite entropy systems.</description>

      <title>Building a Privacy Web with SPIDEr -- Secure Pipeline for Information De-Identification with End-to-End Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data de-identification makes it possible to glean insights from data while preserving user privacy. The use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) allow for the execution of de-identification applications on the cloud without the need for a user to trust the third-party application provider. In this paper, we present \textit{SPIDEr - Secure Pipeline for Information De-Identification with End-to-End Encryption}, our implementation of an end-to-end encrypted data de-identification pipeline. SPIDEr supports classical anonymisation techniques such as suppression, pseudonymisation, generalisation, and aggregation, as well as techniques that offer a formal privacy guarantee such as k-anonymisation and differential privacy. To enable scalability and improve performance on constrained TEE hardware, we enable batch processing of data for differential privacy computations. We present our design of the control flows for end-to-end secure execution of de-identification operations within a TEE. As part of the control flow for running SPIDEr within the TEE, we perform attestation, a process that verifies that the software binaries were properly instantiated on a known, trusted platform.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent inference in empirical risk minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent is one of the most widely used iterative algorithms in modern statistical learning. However, its precise algorithmic dynamics in high-dimensional settings remain only partially understood, which has therefore limited its broader potential for statistical inference applications.
  This paper provides a precise, non-asymptotic distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates in a broad class of empirical risk minimization problems, in the so-called mean-field regime where the sample size is proportional to the signal dimension. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory holds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and reveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely characterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in the mean-field regime.
  Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically intractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent inference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad class of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution can be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization error of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates for inference of the unknown signal. Detailed applications to two canonical models--linear regression and (generalized) logistic regression--are worked out to illustrate model-specific features of our general theory and inference methods.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Shaping for Nonlinearity Tolerance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the input probability distribution of a discrete-time channel is a standard step in the information-theoretic analysis of digital communication systems. Nevertheless, many practical communication systems transmit uniformly and independently distributed symbols drawn from regular constellation sets. The introduction of the probabilistic amplitude shaping architecture has renewed interest in using optimized probability distributions, i.e., probabilistic shaping. Traditionally, probabilistic shaping has been employed to reduce the transmit power required for a given information rate over additive noise channels. While this translates into substantive performance gains for optical fiber communication systems, the interaction of shaping and fiber nonlinearity has posed intriguing questions. At first glance, probabilistic shaping seems to exacerbate nonlinear interference noise (NLIN) due to larger higher-order standardized moments. Therefore, the optimization of shaping distributions must differ from those used for linear channels. Secondly, finite-length effects related to the memory of the nonlinear fiber channel have been observed. This suggests that the marginal input-symbol distribution is not the only consideration. This paper provides a tutorial-style discussion of probabilistic shaping for optical fiber communication. Since the distinguishing property of the channel is the signal-dependent NLIN, we speak of probabilistic shaping for nonlinearity tolerance. Our analysis builds on the first-order time-domain perturbation approximation of the nonlinear fiber channel and revisits the notion of linear and nonlinear shaping gain. We largely focus on probabilistic amplitude shaping with popular shaping methods. The concept of shaping via sequence selection is given special consideration, as it inherently optimizes a multivariate distribution for shaped constellations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.09952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to determine the sparse approximation function which has a direct metric relationship with the $\ell_{0}$ quasi-norm, we introduce a wonderful triangle whose sides are composed of $\Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_{0}$, $\Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_{1}$ and $\Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_{\infty}$ for any non-zero vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ by delving into the iterative soft-thresholding operator in this paper. Based on this triangle, we deduce the ratio $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{\infty}$ norms as a sparsity-promoting objective function for sparse signal reconstruction and also try to give the sparsity interval of the signal. Considering the $\ell_{1}/\ell_{\infty}$ minimization from a angle $\beta$ of the triangle corresponding to the side whose length is $\Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_{\infty} - \Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_{1}/\Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_{0}$, we finally demonstrate the performance of existing $\ell_{1}/\ell_{\infty}$ algorithm by comparing it with $\ell_{1}/\ell_{2}$ algorithm.</description>

      <title>Coded Data Rebalancing for Distributed Data Storage Systems with Cyclic Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider replication-based distributed storage systems in which each node stores the same quantum of data and each data bit stored has the same replication factor across the nodes. Such systems are referred to as balanced distributed databases. When existing nodes leave or new nodes are added to this system, the balanced nature of the database is lost, either due to the reduction in the replication factor, or the non-uniformity of the storage at the nodes. This triggers a rebalancing algorithm, that exchanges data between the nodes so that the balance of the database is reinstated. The goal is then to design rebalancing schemes with minimal communication load. In a recent work by Krishnan et al., coded transmissions were used to rebalance a carefully designed distributed database from a node removal or addition. These coded rebalancing schemes have optimal communication load, however, require the file-size to be at least exponential in the system parameters. In this work, we consider a cyclic balanced database (where data is cyclically placed in the system nodes) and present coded rebalancing schemes for node removal and addition in such a database. These databases (and the associated rebalancing schemes) require the file-size to be only cubic in the number of nodes in the system. We bound the advantage of our node removal rebalancing scheme over the uncoded scheme, and show that our scheme has a smaller communication load. In the node addition scenario, the rebalancing scheme presented is a simple uncoded scheme, which we show has optimal load. Finally, we derive a lower bound for the single node-removal rebalancing for the specific choice of data placements specified by our achievable rebalancing schemes, and show that our achievable rebalancing loads are within a multiplicative gap from the lower bound obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) utilizes a compact antenna array to form a nearly continuous aperture, thereby enhancing higher capacity and more flexible configurations compared with conventional MIMO systems, making it attractive in current scientific research. Key questions naturally arise regarding the potential of HMIMO to surpass Shannon's theoretical limits and how far its capabilities can be extended. However, the traditional Shannon information theory falls short in addressing these inquiries because it only focuses on the information itself while neglecting the underlying carrier, electromagnetic (EM) waves, and environmental interactions. To fill up the gap between the theoretical analysis and the practical application for HMIMO systems, we introduce electromagnetic information theory (EIT) in this paper. This paper begins by laying the foundation for HMIMO-oriented EIT, encompassing EM wave equations and communication regions. In the context of HMIMO systems, the resultant physical limitations are presented, involving Chu's limit, Harrington's limit, Hannan's limit, and the evaluation of coupling effects. Field sampling and HMIMO-assisted oversampling are also discussed to guide the optimal HMIMO design within the EIT framework. To comprehensively depict the EM-compliant propagation process, we present the approximate and exact channel modeling approaches in near-/far-field zones. Furthermore, we discuss both traditional Shannon's information theory, employing the probabilistic method, and Kolmogorov information theory, utilizing the functional analysis, for HMIMO-oriented EIT systems.</description>

      <title>Enzymatic cycle-based receivers for approximate maximum a posteriori demodulation of concentration modulated signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular communication is a bio-inspired communication paradigm where molecules are used as the information carrier. This paper considers a molecular communication network where the transmitter uses concentration modulated signals for communication. Our focus is to design receivers that can demodulate these signals. We want the receivers to use enzymatic cycles as their building blocks and can work approximately as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) demodulator. No receivers with all these features exist in the current molecular communication literature. We consider enzymatic cycles because they are a very common class of chemical reactions that are found in living cells. In addition, a MAP receiver has good statistical performance. In this paper, we study the operating regime of an enzymatic cycle and how the parameters of the enzymatic cycles can be chosen so that the receiver can approximately implement a MAP demodulator. We use simulation to study the performance of this receiver. We show that we can reduce the bit-error ratio of the demodulator if the enzymatic cycle operates in specific parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of uRLLC in scalable Cell-free Radio Access Network System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a critical component of beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems, ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC) imposes stringent requirements on latency and reliability. In recent years, with the improvement of mobile communication network, centralized and distributed processing schemes for cellfree massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) have attracted significant research attention. This paper investigates the performance of a novel scalable cell-free radio access network (CF-RAN) architecture featuring multiple edge distributed units (EDUs) under the finite block length regime. Closed expressions for the upper and lower bounds of its expected spectral efficiency (SE) performance are derived, where centralized and fully distributed deployment can be treated as two special cases, respectively. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of user equipments (UEs) and remote radio units (RRUs) is examined and the analysis reveals that the interleaving RRUs deployment associated with the EDU can enhance SE performance under finite block length constraints with specific transmission error probability. The paper also compares Monte Carlo simulation results with multi-RRU clustering-based collaborative processing, validating the accuracy of the space-time exchange theory in the scalable CF-RAN scenario. By deploying scalable EDUs, a practical trade-off between latency and reliability can be achieved through spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF), offering a distributed and scalable realization of the space-time exchange theory.</description>

      <title>Alternating minimization algorithm with initialization analysis for r-local and k-sparse unlabeled sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlabeled sensing is a linear inverse problem with permuted measurements. We propose an alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm with a suitable initialization for two widely considered permutation models: partially shuffled/$k$-sparse permutations and $r$-local/block diagonal permutations. Key to the performance of the AltMin algorithm is the initialization. For the exact unlabeled sensing problem, assuming either a Gaussian measurement matrix or a sub-Gaussian signal, we bound the initialization error in terms of the number of blocks $s$ and the number of shuffles $k$. Experimental results show that our algorithm is fast, applicable to both permutation models, and robust to choice of measurement matrix. We also test our algorithm on several real datasets for the linked linear regression problem and show superior performance compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Distributed and Intelligent Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the distributed and intelligent integrated sensing and communications (DISAC) concept, a transformative approach for 6G wireless networks that extends the emerging concept of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). DISAC addresses the limitations of the existing ISAC models and, to overcome them, it introduces two novel foundational functionalities for both sensing and communications: a distributed architecture (enabling large-scale and energy-efficient tracking of connected users and objects, leveraging the fusion of heterogeneous sensors) and a semantic and goal-oriented framework (enabling the transition from classical data fusion to the composition of semantically selected information).</description>

      <title>On a fibrational construction for optics, lenses, and Dialectica categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <title>Reverse-type Data Processing Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum data processing inequality asserts that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether distinguishability is preserved after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of the relative entropy of quantum channels. Our first result is that quantum channels with an input dimension greater than or equal to the output dimension do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. We propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for three important classes of quantum channels: depolarizing channels, generalized dephasing channels, and amplitude damping channels. As an application, we give the first rigorous construction of level-1 less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable.</description>
