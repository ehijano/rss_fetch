      <title>On the edge of complexity: The simplest not simple coupled mechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that during normal modes of an oscillatory system consisting of a hoop and a cylinder joining their centers by an ideal spring, its central mass does not remain at rest. This effect is due to the resultant external static friction forces acting on the system which disappears when the coupled rigid bodies have the same moment of inertia. However, in case of different moment of inertia by proper positioning the two fixed end points of the spring vertically, it is shown that the central mass of the system remains at rest. The equation of motion of the coupled system is derived using dynamic equations, Lagrange's equations, Hamilton's equations and even by applying the conservation laws of energy and angular momentum. The relationship between the static friction forces acting on the rigid bodies is also examined.</description>

      <title>Not All Uniform B-Fields Are The Same!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set up a charged rectangular-plate capacitor in a uniform $\mathbf{B}$-field. Quasi-statically turn off the $\mathbf{B}$-field - what happens? We show that this seemingly simple induction problem (which appears in a famous undergraduate electrodynamics textbook) highlights the causal structure of electrodynamics. It may be (as it is in this problem) that different source configurations can produce the same uniform $\mathbf{B}$-field over some finite region, but very different dynamics when the source is turned off. We see also that the vector potential gives more information about the source of the $\mathbf{B}$-field, and is a very useful (and under-appreciated) way to understand induction and other key aspects of electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Pancharatnam-Berry Geometric Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric phases provide a unified framework for understanding diverse phenomena in quantum and classical physics. The Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phase, arising from variation of optical transverse polarization, has transformed light manipulation. However, this phase has never been observed in sound waves due to their curl-free longitudinal nature. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the PB phase can emerge in general inhomogeneous sound waves with polarization evolution of velocity field. Using surface sound waves as an example, we uncover the intriguing Janus property of the PB phase arising from spin-momentum locking, and realize acoustic PB metasurfaces for versatile wavefront manipulation. We further extend the mechanism to free-space structured sound and realize acoustic $q$-plate for generating acoustic vortices through spin-orbit interaction. Our work provides new insights into sound wave properties and enables the manipulation of inhomogeneous acoustic fields via the PB phase, with potential applications in acoustic communications and imaging.</description>

      <title>Magnetic levitation at low rotation frequencies using an on-axis magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ucar effect is a simple yet astonishing phenomenon where a permanent magnet can be levitated by placing it in the vicinity of another permanent magnet that rotates sufficiently fast. The few previous works on this type of magnetic levitation all required magnets rotating on the order of 200 Hz. Here we investigate the influence of applying a static magnetic field on the rotation axis and show that this can lower the needed rotation frequency to below 50 Hz. We explain this by a detailed analysis of the force producing levitation, which is a superposition of a repelling force caused by the off-axis (rotating) magnetic field and an attractive force due to the on-axis field. We study this force and resulting levitation experimentally, analytically and numerically for three different rotor magnet configurations, showing that trends in the levitation distance and frequency range can be accurately predicted from both the numerical and analytical models.</description>

      <title>Radially Locked Sun-Ray Patterns in Autocatalytic Reaction-Diffusion-Advection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traveling fronts ubiquitous in physics, chemistry, and biology are prone to transverse cellular deformations due to diffusive or convective instabilities. Here we show both theoretically and experimentally that new patterns can be obtained if the destabilization is triggered around a front locked radially by advection. Specifically, angularly shifting sun-ray-like patterns can develop around radially advected autocatalytic fronts due to a diffusive instability developing when the autocatalyst X and the reactant Y diffuse at different rates. The properties of these shining-star structures can be controlled by tuning the flow rate $Q$ and the ratio of diffusion coefficients $\delta$ as evidenced by linear stability analysis, nonlinear simulations, and experiments on the chlorite-tetrathionate reaction.</description>
