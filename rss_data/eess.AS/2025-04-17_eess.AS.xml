      <title>Benchmarking Audio Deepfake Detection Robustness in Real-world Communication Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) systems often struggle to generalise effectively due to the significantly degraded audio quality caused by audio codec compression and channel transmission effects in real-world communication scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed a rigorous benchmark to evaluate ADD system performance under such scenarios. We introduced ADD-C, a new test dataset to evaluate the robustness of ADD systems under diverse communication conditions, including different combinations of audio codecs for compression and Packet Loss Rates (PLR). Benchmarking on three baseline ADD models with the ADD-C dataset demonstrated a significant decline in robustness under such conditions. A novel data augmentation strategy was proposed to improve the robustness of ADD systems. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach increases the performance of ADD systems significantly with the proposed ADD-C dataset. Our benchmark can assist future efforts towards building practical and robustly generalisable ADD systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal Attention Pooling for Frequency Dynamic Convolution in Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly frequency dynamic convolution (FDY conv), have significantly improved sound event detection (SED) by enabling frequency-adaptive feature extraction. However, FDY conv relies on temporal average pooling, which treats all temporal frames equally, limiting its ability to capture transient sound events such as alarm bells, door knocks, and speech plosives. To address this limitation, we propose temporal attention pooling frequency dynamic convolution (TFD conv) to replace temporal average pooling with temporal attention pooling (TAP). TAP adaptively weights temporal features through three complementary mechanisms: time attention pooling (TA) for emphasizing salient features, velocity attention pooling (VA) for capturing transient changes, and conventional average pooling for robustness to stationary signals. Ablation studies show that TFD conv improves average PSDS1 by 3.02% over FDY conv with only a 14.8% increase in parameter count. Classwise ANOVA and Tukey HSD analysis further demonstrate that TFD conv significantly enhances detection performance for transient-heavy events, outperforming existing FDY conv models. Notably, TFD conv achieves a maximum PSDS1 score of 0.456, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SED systems. We also explore the compatibility of TAP with other FDY conv variants, including dilated FDY conv (DFD conv), partial FDY conv (PFD conv), and multi-dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv). Among these, the integration of TAP with MDFD conv achieves the best result with a PSDS1 score of 0.459, validating the complementary strengths of temporal attention and multi-scale frequency adaptation. These findings establish TFD conv as a powerful and generalizable framework for enhancing both transient sensitivity and overall feature robustness in SED.</description>

      <title>EmoVoice: LLM-based Emotional Text-To-Speech Model with Freestyle Text Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EmoVoice-DF55. Dataset, code, and checkpoints will be released.</description>

      <title>CST-former: Multidimensional Attention-based Transformer for Sound Event Localization and Detection in Real Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection (SELD) is a task for the classification of sound events and the identification of direction of arrival (DoA) utilizing multichannel acoustic signals. For effective classification and localization, a channel-spectro-temporal transformer (CST-former) was suggested. CST-former employs multidimensional attention mechanisms across the spatial, spectral, and temporal domains to enlarge the model's capacity to learn the domain information essential for event detection and DoA estimation over time. In this work, we present an enhanced version of CST-former with multiscale unfolded local embedding (MSULE) developed to capture and aggregate domain information over multiple time-frequency scales. Also, we propose finetuning and post-processing techniques beneficial for conducting the SELD task over limited training datasets. In-depth ablation studies of the proposed architecture and detailed analysis on the proposed modules are carried out to validate the efficacy of multidimensional attentions on the SELD task. Empirical validation through experimentation on STARSS22 and STARSS23 datasets demonstrates the remarkable performance of CST-former and post-processing techniques without using external data.</description>

      <title>GOAT-TTS: LLM-based Text-To-Speech Generation Optimized via A Dual-Branch Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2) stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings, enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language, timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-k layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of synthesized dialect speech data.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Cross-Modal Interaction Between Music and Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has driven innovation across various industries, particularly in the field of music. By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Can Masked Autoencoders Also Listen to Birds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) pretrained on AudioSet fail to capture the fine-grained acoustic characteristics of specialized domains such as bioacoustic monitoring. Bird sound classification is critical for assessing environmental health, yet general-purpose models inadequately address its unique acoustic challenges. To address this, we introduce Bird-MAE, a domain-specialized MAE pretrained on the large-scale BirdSet dataset. We explore adjustments to pretraining, fine-tuning and utilizing frozen representations. Bird-MAE achieves state-of-the-art results across all BirdSet downstream tasks, substantially improving multi-label classification performance compared to the general-purpose Audio-MAE baseline. Additionally, we propose prototypical probing, a parameter-efficient method for leveraging MAEs' frozen representations. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37\% in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately 3\% on average on BirdSet.</description>

      <title>A Multi-task Learning Balanced Attention Convolutional Neural Network Model for Few-shot Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is of great significance for the protection of marine diversity and national defense security. The development of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces challenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex environmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task balanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN). The method integrates a channel attention mechanism with a multi-task learning strategy, constructing a shared feature extractor and multi-task classifiers to jointly optimize target classification and feature reconstruction tasks. The channel attention mechanism dynamically enhances discriminative acoustic features such as harmonic structures while suppressing noise. Experiments on the Watkins Marine Life Dataset demonstrate that MT-BCA-CNN achieves 97\% classification accuracy and 95\% $F1$-score in 27-class few-shot scenarios, significantly outperforming traditional CNN and ACNN models, as well as popular state-of-the-art UATR methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic benefits of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, while a dynamic weighting adjustment strategy effectively balances task contributions. This work provides an efficient solution for few-shot underwater acoustic recognition, advancing research in marine bioacoustics and sonar signal processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SIFT (Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning), a 50M-example dataset designed for instruction fine-tuning and pre-training of speech-text large language models (LLMs). SIFT-50M is built from publicly available speech corpora, which collectively contain 14K hours of speech, and leverages LLMs along with off-the-shelf expert models. The dataset spans five languages, encompassing a diverse range of speech understanding as well as controllable speech generation instructions. Using SIFT-50M, we train SIFT-LLM, which outperforms existing speech-text LLMs on instruction-following benchmarks while achieving competitive performance on foundational speech tasks. To support further research, we also introduce EvalSIFT, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of speech-text LLMs.</description>

      <title>Learning spatial hearing via innate mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The acoustic cues used by humans and other animals to localise sounds are subtle, and change during and after development. This means that we need to constantly relearn or recalibrate the auditory spatial map throughout our lifetimes. This is often thought of as a "supervised" learning process where a "teacher" (for example, a parent, or your visual system) tells you whether or not you guessed the location correctly, and you use this information to update your map. However, there is not always an obvious teacher (for example in babies or blind people). Using computational models, we showed that approximate feedback from a simple innate circuit, such as that can distinguish left from right (e.g. the auditory orienting response), is sufficient to learn an accurate full-range spatial auditory map. Moreover, using this mechanism in addition to supervised learning can more robustly maintain the adaptive neural representation. We find several possible neural mechanisms that could underlie this type of learning, and hypothesise that multiple mechanisms may be present and interact with each other. We conclude that when studying spatial hearing, we should not assume that the only source of learning is from the visual system or other supervisory signal. Further study of the proposed mechanisms could allow us to design better rehabilitation programmes to accelerate relearning/recalibration of spatial maps.</description>

      <title>Presto! Distilling Steps and Layers for Accelerating Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in diffusion-based text-to-music (TTM) methods, efficient, high-quality generation remains a challenge. We introduce Presto!, an approach to inference acceleration for score-based diffusion transformers via reducing both sampling steps and cost per step. To reduce steps, we develop a new score-based distribution matching distillation (DMD) method for the EDM-family of diffusion models, the first GAN-based distillation method for TTM. To reduce the cost per step, we develop a simple, but powerful improvement to a recent layer distillation method that improves learning via better preserving hidden state variance. Finally, we combine our step and layer distillation methods together for a dual-faceted approach. We evaluate our step and layer distillation methods independently and show each yield best-in-class performance. Our combined distillation method can generate high-quality outputs with improved diversity, accelerating our base model by 10-18x (230/435ms latency for 32 second mono/stereo 44.1kHz, 15x faster than comparable SOTA) -- the fastest high-quality TTM to our knowledge. Sound examples can be found at https://presto-music.github.io/web/.</description>

      <title>EmoSphere++: Emotion-Controllable Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech via Emotion-Adaptive Spherical Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (TTS) technology has achieved significant progress in recent years; however, challenges remain owing to the inherent complexity of emotions and limitations of the available emotional speech datasets and models. Previous studies typically relied on limited emotional speech datasets or required extensive manual annotations, restricting their ability to generalize across different speakers and emotional styles. In this paper, we present EmoSphere++, an emotion-controllable zero-shot TTS model that can control emotional style and intensity to resemble natural human speech. We introduce a novel emotion-adaptive spherical vector that models emotional style and intensity without human annotation. Moreover, we propose a multi-level style encoder that can ensure effective generalization for both seen and unseen speakers. We also introduce additional loss functions to enhance the emotion transfer performance for zero-shot scenarios. We employ a conditional flow matching-based decoder to achieve high-quality and expressive emotional TTS in a few sampling steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous or conversational multilingual speech presents many challenges for state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this work, we present a new technique AMPS that augments a multilingual multimodal ASR system with paraphrase-based supervision for improved conversational ASR in multiple languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada, and Nyanja. We use paraphrases of the reference transcriptions as additional supervision while training the multimodal ASR model and selectively invoke this paraphrase objective for utterances with poor ASR performance. Using AMPS with a state-of-the-art multimodal model SeamlessM4T, we obtain significant relative reductions in word error rates (WERs) of up to 5%. We present detailed analyses of our system using both objective and human evaluation metrics.</description>

Abstract: Foley is a key element in video production, refers to the process of adding an audio signal to a silent video while ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. In recent years, the rise of personalized content creation and advancements in automatic video-to-audio models have increased the demand for greater user control in the process. One possible approach is to incorporate text to guide audio generation. While supported by existing methods, challenges remain in ensuring compatibility between modalities, particularly when the text introduces additional information or contradicts the sounds naturally inferred from the visuals. In this work, we introduce CAFA (Controllable Automatic Foley Artist) a video-and-text-to-audio model that generates semantically and temporally aligned audio for a given video, guided by text input. CAFA is built upon a text-to-audio model and integrates video information through a modality adapter mechanism. By incorporating text, users can refine semantic details and introduce creative variations, guiding the audio synthesis beyond the expected video contextual cues. Experiments show that besides its superior quality in terms of semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization the proposed method enable high textual controllability as demonstrated in subjective and objective evaluations.</description>
