      <title>The first catalogue of candidate white dwarf-main sequence binaries in open star clusters: A new window into common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close binary systems are the progenitors to both Type Ia supernovae and the compact object mergers that can be detected via gravitational waves. To achieve a binary with a small radial separation, it is believed that the system likely undergoes common envelope (CE) evolution. Despite its importance, CE evolution may be one of the largest uncertainties in binary evolution due to a combination of computational challenges and a lack of observed benchmarks where both the post-CE and pre-CE conditions are known. Identifying post-CE systems in star clusters can partially circumvent this second issue by providing an independent age constraint on the system. For the first time, we conduct a systematic search for white dwarf (WD) and main-sequence (MS) binary systems in 299 Milky Way open star clusters. Coupling Gaia DR3 photometry and kinematics with multi-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS, we apply a machine learning based approach and find 52 high-probability candidates in 38 open clusters. For a subset of our systems, we present follow-up spectroscopy from the Gemini and Lick Observatories and archival light curves from TESS, Kepler/K2 and the Zwicky Transient Facility. Examples of M-dwarfs with hot companions are spectroscopically observed, along with regular system variability. While the kinematics of our candidates are consistent with their host clusters, some systems have spatial positions offset relative to their hosts, potentially indicative of natal kicks. Ultimately, this catalogue is a first step to obtaining a set of observational benchmarks to better link post-CE systems to their pre-CE progenitors.</description>

      <title>Massive White Dwarfs in the 100 pc Sample: Magnetism, Rotation, Pulsations, and the Merger Fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed model atmosphere analysis of massive white dwarfs with $M &gt; 0.9~M_\odot$ and $T_{\rm eff}\geq11,000$ K in the Montreal White Dwarf Database 100 pc sample and the Pan-STARRS footprint. We obtained follow-up optical spectroscopy of 109 objects with no previous spectral classification in the literature. Our spectroscopic follow-up is now complete for all 204 objects in the sample. We find 118 normal DA white dwarfs, including 45 massive DAs near the ZZ Ceti instability strip. There are no normal massive DBs: the six DBs in the sample are strongly magnetic and/or rapidly rotating. There are 20 massive DQ white dwarfs in our sample, and all are found in the crystallization sequence. In addition, 66 targets are magnetic (32% of the sample). We use magnetic white dwarf atmosphere models to constrain the field strength and geometry using offset dipole models. We also use magnetism, kinematics, and rotation measurements to constrain the fraction of merger remnant candidates among this population. The merger fraction of this sample increases from 25% for 0.9-$1~M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs to 49% for 1.2-$1.3~M_{\odot}$. However, this fraction is as high as $78_{-7}^{+4}$% for 1.1-$1.2~M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs. Previous works have demonstrated that 5-9% of high-mass white dwarfs stop cooling for $\sim8$ Gyr due to the $^{22}$Ne distillation process, which leads to an overdensity of Q-branch stars in the solar neighborhood. We demonstrate that the over-abundance of the merger remnant candidates in our sample is likely due to the same process.</description>

      <title>Tilted Disk Precession and Negative Superhumps in HS 2325+8205: A Multi-Window Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilted disk precession exists in different objects. Negative superhumps (NSHs) in cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) are hypothesized to arise from the interaction between the reverse precession of a tilted disk and the streams from the secondary star. Utilizing TESS photometry, we present a comprehensive investigation into the tilted disk precession and NSHs in the dwarf nova (DN) HS 2325+8205, employing eclipse minima, eclipse depths, NSH frequencies, and NSH amplitudes and the correlation between them as the windows. We report the discovery of NSHs in HS 2325+8205 with a period of 0.185671(17) d. The NSH frequency was found to vary with a period of 3.943(9) d, similar to the tilted disk precession period validated in novae-like star (NL, SDSS J0812) and intermediate polar (IP, TV Col). The eclipsing minima of O-C were similarly found to vary cyclically in period 4.135(5) d, showing faster rise than fall. Furthermore, NSH amplitude varies parabolically, linearly increasing with periodic variations, potentially linked to changes in disk radius, mass transfer rate, and apparent area of the hot spot. Additionally, for the first time in DNe, we observe bi-periodic variations in eclipse depth (P1= 4.131(4) d and P2= 2.065(2) d ~ Pprec/2), resembling those seen in IPs, suggesting that variations with P2 are not attributable to the accretion curtain. Moreover, NSH amplitude and eclipse depth decrease with increasing NSH frequency, while NSH amplitude correlates positively with eclipse depth.These complex variations observed across multiple observational windows provide substantial evidence for understanding of tilted disk precession and NSHs.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: first data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first public data release of the S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS), a photometric survey with short exposure times, covering approximately 9300 deg$^{2}$ of the Southern sky. The USS utilizes the Javalambre 12-band magnitude system, including narrow and medium-band and broad-band filters targeting prominent stellar spectral features. The primary objective of the USS is to identify bright, extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -3$) and ultra metal-poor (UMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -4$) stars for further analysis using medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy.}{This paper provides an overview of the survey observations, calibration method, data quality, and data products. Additionally, it presents the selection of EMP and UMP candidates.}{The data from the USS were reduced and calibrated using the same methods as presented in the S-PLUS DR2. An additional step was introduced, accounting for the offset between the observed magnitudes off the USS and the predicted magnitudes from the very low-resolution Gaia XP spectra.}{This first release contains data for 163 observed fields totaling $\sim$324 deg$^{2}$ along the Celestial Equator. The magnitudes obtained from the USS are well-calibrated, showing a difference of $\sim 15$ mmag compared to the predicted magnitudes by the GaiaXPy toolkit. By combining colors and magnitudes, 140 candidates for EMP or UMP have been identified for follow-up studies.}{The S-PLUS USS DR1 is an important milestone in the search for bright metal-poor stars, with magnitudes in the range 10 $ &lt; r \leq 14$. The USS is an ongoing survey; in the near future, it will provide many more bright metal-poor candidate stars for spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>Signature of high-amplitude pulsations in seven Delta Sct stars via TESS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regular behavior of the pulsations of high-amplitude Delta Sct (HADS) stars gives a greater chance to investigate the interiors of stars. We analyzed seven HADS stars showing peak-to-peak amplitudes of more than 0.3 mag that were newly observed by TESS. We obtained that TIC374753270, TIC710783, and TIC187386415 pulsate in fundamental radial mode, also, TIC130474019 and TIC160120432 show double radial modes. On the other hand, TIC148357344 and TIC 278119167 demonstrate triple-mode behavior. Our analysis shows that these seven stars are close to the red edge of the (inside) instability strip in the Hertzsprung Russell diagram. The fundamental mode of these seven targets follows the period-luminosity (PL) relation for Delta Sct stars. However, TIC278119167 deviates slightly from the fundamental PL relation. The double-mode and triple-mode HADS stars (TIC130474019, TIC160120432, TIC148357344, and TIC278119167) are in agreement with the period ratio ranges (fundamental to first and second overtones). Using the information of 176 HADS stars (Netzel and Smolec), we find a scaling relation ([Fe/H] ~log((M**7.95+-0.15)(L**-1.83+-0.11)(P0**0.79+-0.14)(Teff**0.047+-0.02))) between the metallicity ([Fe/H]) and mass (M), luminosity (L), effective temperature (Teff), and the fundamental period (P0). We estimate the metallicity of the seven newly identified HADS stars ranging from -0.62 to 0.37 dex.</description>

      <title>SPIRou monitoring of the protostar V347 Aur: binarity, magnetic fields, pulsed dynamo and accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in this paper an analysis of near-infrared observations of the 0.3 Msun protostar V347 Aur collected with the SPIRou high-resolution spectropolarimeter and velocimeter at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from October 2019 to April 2023. From a set of 79 unpolarized and circularly polarized spectra of V347 Aur to which we applied Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD), we derived radial velocities and longitudinal fields, along with their temporal variations over our monitoring campaign of 1258 d. Our data show that V347 Aur is an eccentric binary system with an orbital period 154.6$\pm$0.7 d, experiencing strong to extreme accretion events near periastron. The companion is a 29.0$\pm$1.6 Mjup brown dwarf, a rare member in the brown dwarf desert of close companions around M dwarfs. We detect weak longitudinal fields (&lt;100~G) at the surface of V347 Aur, significantly weaker than those of more evolved prototypical T Tauri stars. These fields show small-amplitude rotational modulation, indicating a mainly axisymmetric parent large-scale magnetic topology, and larger fluctuations at half the orbital period, suggesting that a pulsed dynamo triggered by orbital motion operates in V347 Aur. Applying Zeeman-Doppler imaging to our circularly polarised LSD profiles, we find that the large-scale field of V347 Aur is mainly toroidal for most of our observations, with the toroidal component switching sign near periastron and apoastron. The weak large-scale dipole (~30 G) is not able to disrupt the disc beyond 1.3 Rstar even outside accretion episodes, implying longitudinally distributed (rather than localized) accretion at the surface of the protostar.</description>

      <title>Photometric White Dwarf Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a census of photometrically detected rotation periods for white dwarf stars. We analyzed the light curves of 9285 white dwarf stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) up to sector 69. Using Fourier transform analyses and the TESS localize software, we detected variability periods for 318 white dwarf stars. The 115 high probability likely single white dwarfs in our sample have a median rotational period of 3.9 hours and a median absolute deviation of 3.5 h. Our distribution is significantly different from the distribution of the rotational period from asteroseismology, which exhibits a longer median period of 24.3 hours and a median absolute deviation of 12.0 h. In addition, we reported non-pulsating periods for three known pulsating white dwarfs with rotational period previously determined by asteroseismology: NGC 1501, TIC 7675859, and G226-29. We also calculated evolutionary models that include six angular momentum transfer mechanisms from the literature throughout evolution in an attempt to reproduce our findings. Our models indicate that the temperature-period relation of most observational data is best fitted by models with low metallicity, probably indicating problems with the computations of angular-momentum loss during the high-mass-loss phase. Our models also generate internal magnetic fields through the Tayler-Spruit dynamo.</description>

      <title>Preparing for Heliopolarimetry using New-generation Ground-based Radio Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale ejections of magnetized plasma from the Sun and are associated with the most extreme space weather events. The geoeffectiveness of a CME is primarily determined by the southward component of its magnetic fields (CME-$B_z$). Recent studies have shown that CMEs evolve significantly in the inner heliosphere ($\sim20-90\ R_\odot$), and relying on extrapolations from low coronal heights can lead to wrong predictions of CME-$B_z$ in the vicinity of Earth. Hence, it is important to measure CME magnetic fields at these heights to improve CME-$B_z$ prediction. A promising method to measure the CME-entrained magnetic field in the inner heliosphere is by measuring the changes in Faraday rotation (FR) of linearly polarized emission from background radio sources as their line-of-sight crosses the CME plasma. Here, we present the current preparation of new-generation ground-based radio telescopes for this purpose.</description>

      <title>The Radio Continuum Source Projected Near HR 8799</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HR 8799 is an A5/F0 V star where exoplanets were first directly imaged. Four exoplanets were found within $\simeq 2\rlap.{''}0$ from the star. Here we report the VLA detection of a faint (19.1$\pm$2.7 $\mu$Jy) radio continuum (3.0 GHz) source projected at $\simeq 2\rlap.{''}2$ from the star. The \sl a priori \rm probability of finding a background source with this flux density within a radius of $2\rlap.{''}2$ is only 0.0046. However, the astrometry made with the VLA and ALMA images, separated by 5.5 years, indicates no significant proper motions and rules out the association of the radio source with the HR 8799 system and suggests it is a background millimeter galaxy with dust emission in the millimeter and partially thick synchrotron emission in the centimeter.</description>

      <title>Low velocity streams inside the planetary nebula H 2-18. A 3D photoionization and kinematical reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Numerous planetary nebulae show complicated inner structures not obviously explained. For one such object we undertake a detailed 3D photoionization and kinematical model analysis for a better understanding of the underlying shaping processes. Methods. We obtained 2D ARGUS/IFU spectroscopy covering the whole nebula in selected, representative emission lines. A 3D photoionization modelling was used to compute images and line profiles. Comparison of the observations with the models was used to fine-tune the model details. This predicts the approximate nebular 3D structure and kinematics. Results. We found that within a cylindrical outer nebula there is a hidden, very dense, bar-like or cylindrical inner structure. Both features are co-axial and are inclined to the sky by 40 deg. A wide asymmetric one-sided plume attached to one end of the bar is proposed to be a flat structure. All nebular components share the same kinematics, with an isotropic velocity field which monotonically increases with distance from the star before reaching a plateau. The relatively low velocities indicate that the observed shapes do not require particularly energetic processes and there is no indication for the current presence of a jet. The 3D model reproduces the observed line ratios and the detailed structure of the object significantly better than previous models.</description>

      <title>Metallicity of RR Lyrae stars from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalogue computed with Machine Learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new $P -\phi_{31}-{\rm [Fe/H]}$ and $P -\phi_{31}- A_2 - {\rm [Fe/H]}$ relations for fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone mode (RRc) RR Lyrae stars (RRLs), respectively. The relations were calibrated based on pulsation periods and Fourier parameters of the RRL light curves in the Gaia $G$-band published in the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), and accurate spectroscopically measured metallicities available in the literature. We apply the feature selection algorithm to identify the most relevant parameters for the determination of metallicity. To fit the relations, we used the Bayesian approach, which allowed us to carefully take into account uncertainties in various parameters and the intrinsic scatter of the relations. The root mean squared errors of the predicted metallicity values in the training samples are 0.28 dex and 0.21 dex for RRab and RRc stars, respectively, comparable with the typical uncertainty of low/intermediate resolution spectroscopic metallicity measurements. We applied the new relations to measure individual metallicities and distances to $\sim$ 134,000 RRLs from the Gaia DR3 catalogue, as well as mean metallicities and distances to 38 Milky Way globular clusters. We also estimate the mean metallicity and distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC): ${\rm [Fe/H]_{LMC} = -1.63\pm0.36}$ and $\mu_{\rm LMC}=18.55\pm0.18$~mag, ${\rm [Fe/H]_{SMC}=-1.86\pm0.36}$~dex and $\mu_{\rm SMC}=19.01\pm 0.17$~mag, respectively, in excellent agreement with previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Effects of stratification on overshooting and waves atop the convective core of $5M_{\odot}$ main-sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a massive star evolves along the main sequence, its core contracts, leaving behind a stable stratification in helium. We simulate 2D convection in the core at three different stages of evolution of a $5M_{\odot}$ star, with three different stratifications in helium atop the core. We study the propagation of internal gravity waves in the stably-stratified envelope, along with the overshooting length of convective plumes above the convective boundary. We find that the stratification in helium in evolved stars hinders radial motions and effectively shields the radiative envelope against plume penetration. This prevents convective overshooting from being an efficient mixing process in the radiative envelope. In addition, internal gravity waves are less excited in evolved models compared to the zero-age-main-sequence model, and are also more damped in the stratified region above the core. As a result, the wave power is several orders of magnitude lower in mid- and terminal-main-sequence models compared to zero-age-main-sequence stars.</description>

We present a viable equation governing the acceleration of solar wind of a polytropic gas and give its analytical and numerical solution and deduce its asymptotic analytic properties (i) near the sun, (ii) far away from the sun, (iii) near the Parker sonic critical point (where the wind speed is equal to the speed of sound in the wind). We proceed to give a detailed and systematic investigation of coronal-hole polytropic gas outflows which contribute to bulk of the solar wind. We will model coronal-hole outflow by considering a single radial stream tube and use phenomenological considerations to represent its rapidly-diverging flow geometry. We give analytical and numerical solutions for this outflow and deduce its asymptotic analytic properties in the three flow regimes above. We find that, in general, the polytropic effects cause the Parker sonic critical point to move closer to the sun than that for the case with isothermal gas. Furthermore, the flow acceleration is found to exhibit (even for an infinitesimal deviation from isothermality of the gas) a power-law behavior rather than an exponential-law behavior near the sun or a logarithmic-law behavior far away from the sun, thus implying a certain robustness of the power-law behavior. The Parker sonic critical point is shown to continue to be of X-type, hence facilitating a smooth transition from subsonic to supersonic wind flow through the transonic regime. Our analytical and numerical solutions show that the super-radiality of the stream tube causes the Parker sonic critical point to move further down in the corona, and the gas to become more diabatic (the polytropic exponent $\gamma$ drops further below 5/3), and the flow acceleration to be enhanced.</description>

      <title>Hard X-rays from the deep solar atmosphere: An unusual UV burst with flare properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explosive transient events occur throughout the solar atmosphere. The differing manifestations range from coronal mass ejections to Ellermann bombs. The former may have negligible signatures in the lower atmosphere, and the latter may have negligible nonthermal emissions such as hard X-radiation. A solar flare generally involves a broad range of emission signatures. Using a suite of four space-borne telescopes, we report a solar event that combines aspects of simple UV bursts and hard X-ray emitting flares at the same time. The event is a compact C-class flare in active region AR11861, SOL2013-10-12T00:30. By fitting a combined isothermal and nonthermal model to the hard X-ray spectrum, we inferred plasma temperatures in excess of 15\,MK and a nonthermal power of about $3\times10^{27}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ in this event. Despite these high temperatures and evidence for nonthermal particles, the flare was mostly confined to the chromosphere. However, the event lacked clear signatures of UV spectral lines, such as the Fe\,{\sc xii} 1349\,\AA\ and Fe\,{\sc xxi} 1354\,\AA\ emission lines, which are characteristic of emission from hotter plasma with a temperature over 1\,MK. Moreover, the event exhibited very limited signatures in the extreme-UV wavelengths. Our study indicates that a UV burst -- hard X-ray flare hybrid phenomenon exists in the low solar atmosphere. Plasma that heats to high temperatures coupled with particle acceleration by magnetic energy that is released directly in the lower atmosphere sheds light on the nature of active region core heating and on inferences of flare signatures.</description>

Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a future CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band, by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. The project is in the framework of the Italian Space Agency Alcor Program, which aims to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP is approved for a Phase B study that will last for 12 months, starting in mid-2024. We report on the current status of the CUSP mission project as the outcome of the Phase A.</description>

      <title>Towards imaging-spectro-polarimetry of solar flares in the X-rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray polarimetry of solar flares is still a not well established field of observation of our star. Past polarimeters were not able to measure with a high significance the polarization in X-rays from solar flares. Moreover, they had no imaging capabilities and measured only the polarization by integrating on all the image of the source. We propose a mission concept based on a gas photoelectric polarimeter, coupled with multilayer lobster-eye optics, to perform imaging-spectro-polarimetry of solar flares while monitoring the entire solar disc.</description>

      <title>Structural Implications of the Chameleon Mechanism on White Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the chameleon mechanism on the structure of white dwarfs. Using a shooting method of our design, we solve the corresponding scalar-tensor equilibrium equations for a Chandrasekhar equation of state, exploring various energy scales and couplings of the chameleon field to matter. We find the chameleon field to be in a thick-shell configuration, identifying for the first time in the literature a similarity relation for the radially normalised scalar field gradient. Our analysis reveals that the chameleon mechanism significantly alters the internal pressure of white dwarfs, leading to a notable reduction in the stellar radii and masses and shifting the mass-radius curves below those predicted by Newtonian gravity. Finally, we derive parametric expressions from our results to expedite future analyses of white dwarfs in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>FAUST XVII: Super deuteration in the planet forming system IRS 63 where the streamer strikes the disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that planets formation starts early, in protostellar disks of $\le10^5$ yrs, which are characterized by strong interactions with the environment, e.g., through accretion streamers and molecular outflows. To investigate the impact of such phenomena on disk physical and chemical properties it is key to understand what chemistry planets inherit from their natal environment. In the context of the ALMA Large Program Fifty AU STudy of the chemistry in the disk/envelope system of Solar-like protostars (FAUST), we present observations on scales from ~1500 au to ~60 au of H$_2$CO, HDCO, and D$_2$CO towards the young planet-forming disk IRS~63. H$_2$CO probes the gas in the disk as well as in a large scale streamer (~1500 au) impacting onto the South-East (SE) disk side. We detect for the first time deuterated formaldehyde, HDCO and D$_2$CO, in a planet-forming disk, and HDCO in the streamer that is feeding it. This allows us to estimate the deuterium fractionation of H$_2$CO in the disk: [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO]$\sim0.1-0.3$ and [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO]$\sim0.1$. Interestingly, while HDCO follows the H$_2$CO distribution in the disk and in the streamer, the distribution of D$_2$CO is highly asymmetric, with a peak of the emission (and [D]/[H] ratio) in the SE disk side, where the streamer crashes onto the disk. In addition, D$_2$CO is detected in two spots along the blue- and red-shifted outflow. This suggests that: (i) in the disk, HDCO formation is dominated by gas-phase reactions similarly to H$_2$CO, while (ii) D$_2$CO was mainly formed on the grain mantles during the prestellar phase and/or in the disk itself, and is at present released in the gas-phase in the shocks driven by the streamer and the outflow. These findings testify on the key role of streamers in the build-up of the disk both concerning the final mass available for planet formation and its chemical composition.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation: I. Fixed points and librating orbits of the Brown Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hierarchical triple systems, the inner binary is slowly perturbed by a distant companion, giving rise to large-scale oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, known as von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. Stable systems with a mild hierarchy, where the period ratio is not too small, require an additional corrective term, known as the Brown Hamiltonian, to adequately account for their long-term evolution. Although the Brown Hamiltonian has been used to accurately describe the highly eccentric systems on circulating orbits where the periapse completes a complete revolution, the analysis near its elliptical fixed points had been overlooked. We derive analytically the modified fixed points including the Brown Hamiltonian and analyse its librating orbits (where the periapse motion is limited in range). We compare our result to the direct three-body integrations of millions of orbits and discuss the regimes of validity. We numerically discover the regions of orbital instability, allowed and forbidden librating zones with a complex, fractal, structure. The retrograde orbits, where the mutual inclination is $\iota &gt; 90\ \rm deg$, are more stable and allowed to librate for larger areas of the parameter space. We find numerical fits for the librating-circulating boundary. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications for systems of satellites, stars and compact objects. In a companion paper (paper II), we apply our formalism to the orbits of irregular satellites around giant planets.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation II: The orbits of irregular satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irregular satellites (IS) are believed to have been captured during the Solar system's dynamical history and provide clues for the Solar system's formation and evolution. IS occupy a large fraction of the Hill sphere of their host planet and their orbits are highly perturbed by the Sun. Nevertheless, the phase portrait is much better described by the Brown Hamiltonian for all satellites. We use a novel formalism developed in paper I to characterise their orbits in terms of an effective secular Hamiltonian (the Brown Hamiltonian) that accounts for their large orbital separations. We find that prograde satellites generally follow the Brown Hamiltonian, while retrograde satellites (which extend further) deviate more significantly. We construct a semi-analytic criterion that predicts the librating orbit based on the effective energy due to the Brown Hamiltonian. We also check our results with highly accurate N-body integrations of satellite orbits, where initial conditions are loaded directly from the updated ephemeris from the NASA Horizons database. Although the retrograde librating orbits occupy more area in the parameter space, the vast majority of librating IS are prograde. Using our method we find $13$ librating satellites, $8$ of them previously known to librate, and the rest shown to librate for the first time. Further observations of existing and new satellites could shed more light on the dynamical history of the Solar system and satellite formation and test our results.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in star forming environments: how does field strength affect gas on spiral arm and cloud scales?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate star formation from subparsec to kpc scales with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of a cloud structure and a section of galactic spiral arm. We aim to understand how magnetic fields affect star formation, cloud formation and how feedback couples with magnetic fields on scales of clouds and clumps. We find that magnetic fields overall suppress star formation by $\sim$10% with a weak field (5 $\mu$G), and $\sim50$% with a stronger field (50 $\mu$G). Cluster masses are reduced by about 40% with a strong field but show little change with a weak field. We find that clouds tend to be aligned parallel to the field with a weak field, and become perpendicularly aligned with a stronger field, whereas on clump scales the alignment is more random. The magnetic fields and densities of clouds and clumps in our models agree with the Zeeman measurements of the Crutcher relation $B-\rho$ in the weaker field models, whilst the strongest field models show a relation which is too flat compared to the observations. In all our models, we find both subcritical and supercritical clouds and clumps are present. We also find that if using a line of sight (1D) measure of the magnetic field to determine the critical parameter, the magnetic field, and thereby also criticality, can vary by a factor of 3-4 depending on whether the direction the field is measured along corresponds to the direction of the ordered component of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Surface and curvature tensions of cold dense quark matter: a term-by-term analysis within the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation of the surface and curvature tensions, $\sigma$ and $\gamma$, of three-flavor cold quark matter using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with vector interactions. Our approach ensures both local and global electric charge neutrality, as well as chemical equilibrium under weak interactions. By employing the multiple reflection expansion formalism to account for finite size effects, we explore the impact of specific input parameters, particularly the vector coupling constant ratio $\eta_V$, the radius $R$ of quark matter droplets, as well as charge-per-baryon ratio $\xi$ of the finite size configurations. We focus on the role of the contributions of each term of the NJL Lagrangian to the surface and curvature tensions in the mean field approximation. We find that the total surface tension exhibits two different density regimes: it remains roughly constant at around $100 \, \mathrm{MeV \, fm^{-2}}$ up to approximately $2-4$ times the nuclear saturation density, and beyond this point, it becomes a steeply increasing function of $n_B$. The total surface and curvature tensions are relatively insensitive to variations in $R$ but are affected by changes in $\xi$ and $\eta_V$. We observe that the largest contribution to $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ comes from the regularized divergent term, making these quantities significantly higher than those obtained within the MIT bag model.</description>

      <title>TransformerPayne: enhancing spectral emulation accuracy and data efficiency by capturing long-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar spectra emulators often rely on large grids and tend to reach a plateau in emulation accuracy, leading to significant systematic errors when inferring stellar properties. Our study explores the use of Transformer models to capture long-range information in spectra, comparing their performance to The Payne emulator (a fully connected multilayer perceptron), an expanded version of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these models on synthetic spectra grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing emulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference. The newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.15% when trained on the full grid. The most significant improvements were observed in grids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing 2 to 5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne. Additionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities, allowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to another. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a tenfold reduction in training grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of TransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable features common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up The Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on the full dataset, TransformerPayne consistently achieved the lowest MAE across all tests. The inductive biases of the TransformerPayne emulator enhance accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability for spectral emulation compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Abundances of planetary nebulae and evolved stars: Iron and sulfur depletion, and carbon and nitrogen enrichment, in low- and intermediate-mass stellar populations in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the elemental abundances in Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) compared with those of their stellar progenitors (Red Giant Branch and Asymptotic Giant Branch, RGB and AGB, stars), to explore and quantify the expected -- i.e., due to AGB evolution or condensation onto grains -- differences. We gleaned the current literature for the nebular abundances while we used the APOGEE DR~17 survey data for the stellar sample. We examined the elements in common between the nebular and stellar samples, namely, C, N, O, Fe, and S. We confirm that iron in PNe is mostly entrapped in grains, with an average depletion $&lt;$D[Fe/H]$&gt;$=1.741$\pm$0.486 dex, and we disclose a weak correlation between iron depletion and the [O/H] abundance, D[Fe/H]$=(6.6003\pm2.443)\times{\rm [O/H]} +(1.972\pm0.199)$. Sulfur may also be mildly depleted in PNe, with $&lt;$D[S/H]$&gt;=0.179\pm0.291$ dex. We also found an indication of nitrogen enrichment for PNe $&lt;$E[N/H]$&gt;$=0.393$\pm$0.421 dex, with maximum enrichment (0.980$\pm$0.243) occurring for the PNe whose progenitors have gone through the HBB. The carbon enrichment is $&lt;$E[C/H]$&gt;$=0.332$\pm$0.460 dex when measured for the general PN populations. Our results will be relevant for future Galactic and extragalactic studies comparing nebular and stellar samples.</description>

      <title>High-resolution imaging of the evolving bipolar outflows in symbiotic novae: the case of RSOphiuchi 2021 nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recurrent and symbiotic nova RS Ophiuchi (RSOph) underwent a new outburst phase during August 2021, about 15 years after the last event occurred in 2006. This represents the first nova event ever detected at very-high energies (VHE, E&gt;100\,GeV), and a whole set of coordinated multi-wavelength observations were triggered. The main goals of this work are to characterize the evolving morphology of the expanding bipolar ejecta with high accuracy and determine the physical conditions of the surrounding medium in which they propagate. By means of high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observations, we monitored RSOph with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and e-MERLIN at 1.6 and 5\,GHz during multiple epochs from 14 to 65 days after the explosion. We reveal an evolving source structure, consisting of a central and compact core and two elongated bipolar outflows, expanding on opposite sides from the core in east-west direction. The ejecta angular separation with time is consistent with a linear expansion with an average speed of $\sim7000$ km s$^{-1}$. We find clear evidence of a radial dependence of the density along the density enhancement on the orbital plane (DEOP), going from 1.1$\times$10$^7$ ~cm$^{-3}$ close to the central binary to 3.8$\times$10$^5$~cm$^{-3}$ at $\sim175$~AU. Thanks to the accurate source astrometric position provided by Gaia DR3, in this work we draw a detailed scenario of the geometry and physics of the RSOph evolving source structure after the most recent nova event. We conclude that most of the mass lost by the red giant companion goes in the DEOP, for which we estimate a total mass of $4.3 \times 10^{-6} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and in the circumstellar region, while only a small fraction (about one-tenth) is accreted by the white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Element abundances of galactic RGB stars in the APO-K2 catalogue. Dissimilarity in the scaling with [$\alpha$/Fe]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted an investigation on the chemical abundances of 4,316 stars in the red giant branch (RGB) phase from the recently released APO-K2 catalogue. Our aim was to characterize the abundance trends of the single elements with [$\alpha$/Fe], mainly focusing on C, N, and O, which are the most relevant for the estimation of stellar ages. The chemical analysis of the RGB sample involved cross-matching data from the APO-K2 catalogue with individual element abundances from APOGEE DR17. The analysis detected a statistically significant difference in the [(C+N+O)/Fe] - [$\alpha$/Fe] trend with respect to the simple $\alpha$-enhancement scenario. This difference remained robust across different choices for the reference solar mixture and potential zero-point calibrations of C and N abundances. The primary discrepancy was a steeper increase in [O/Fe] with [$\alpha$/Fe], reaching a 0.1 dex difference at [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.3. Notably, the impact on the evolutionary timescale of such oxygen over-abundance with respect to the commonly adopted uniform $\alpha$-enhancement is rather limited. We verified that stellar models computed using an ad hoc O-rich mixture sped up the evolution by only 1% at [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.3, due to the counterbalancing effects of O enrichment on both the evolutionary timescale and the Z-to-[Fe/H] relationship.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Galactic population of free-floating planets from realistic initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first prediction for the mass distribution function of Galactic free-floating planets (FFPs) that aims to accurately include the relative contributions of multiple formation pathways and stellar populations. We derive our predicted distribution from dedicated simulations of planet birth, growth, migration, and ejection around circumbinary systems and extend these results to also include the contributions from single and wide binary systems. Our resulting FFP mass distribution shows several distinct features, including a strong peak at $\sim 8 M_{\oplus}$ arising from the transition between pebble and gas accretion regimes and a trough at $\sim 1 M_{\oplus}$ due to the shift in the dominant ejection process from planet-planet scattering to ejection through interactions with stars in circumbinary systems. We find that interactions with the central binary in close circumbinary systems are likely the dominant progenitor for FFPs more massive than Earth, leading to a steep power-law dependence in mass that agrees well with existing observations. In contrast, we find planet-planet scattering events in single and wide binary systems likely produce the majority of planets at Mars mass and below, resulting in a shallower power-law dependence. Our results suggest that existing extrapolations into the sub-terrestrial mass range may significantly overestimate the true FFP abundance. The features we predict in the mass distribution of FFPs will be detectable by upcoming space-based microlensing surveys and, if observed, will provide key insight into the origins of FFPs and the environments in which they form.</description>

      <title>Electron-only reconnection and inverse magnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive, and validate numerically, an analytical model for electron-only magnetic reconnection applicable to strongly magnetized (low-beta) plasmas. Our model predicts sub-ion-scale reconnection rates significantly higher than those pertaining to large-scale reconnection, aligning with recent observations and simulations. We apply this reconnection model to the problem of inverse magnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales. We derive time-dependent scaling laws for the magnetic energy decay and the typical magnetic structure dimensions that differ from those previously found in the MHD regime. These scaling laws are validated via two- and three-dimensional simulations, demonstrating that sub-ion scale magnetic fields can reach large, system-size scales via successive coalescence.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the Warm-Jupiter TOI-1130 system with CHEOPS and photo-dynamical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the thousands of exoplanets discovered to date, approximately a few hundred gas giants on short-period orbits are classified as "lonely" and only a few are in a multi-planet system with a smaller companion on a close orbit. The processes that formed multi-planet systems hosting gas giants on close orbits are poorly understood, and only a few examples of this kind of system have been observed and well characterised. Within the contest of multi-planet system hosting gas-giant on short orbits, we characterise TOI-1130 system by measuring masses and orbital parameters. This is a 2-transiting planet system with a Jupiter-like planet (c) on a 8.35 days orbit and a Neptune-like planet (b) on an inner (4.07 days) orbit. Both planets show strong anti-correlated transit timing variations (TTVs). Furthermore, radial velocity (RV) analysis showed an additional linear trend, a possible hint of a non-transiting candidate planet on a far outer orbit. Since 2019, extensive transit and radial velocity observations of the TOI-1130 have been acquired using TESS and various ground-based facilities. We present a new photo-dynamical analysis of all available transit and RV data, with the addition of new CHEOPS and ASTEP+ data that achieve the best precision to date on the planetary radii and masses and on the timings of each transit. We were able to model interior structure of planet b constraining the presence of a gaseous envelope of H/He, while it was not possible to assess the possible water content. Furthermore, we analysed the resonant state of the two transiting planets, and we found that they lie just outside the resonant region. This could be the result of the tidal evolution that the system underwent. We obtained both masses of the planets with a precision less than 1.5%, and radii with a precision of about 1% and 3% for planet b and c, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In the era of space exploration, coronal holes on the sun play a significant role due to their impact on satellites and aircraft through their open magnetic fields and increased solar wind emissions. This study employs computer vision techniques to detect coronal hole regions and estimate their sizes using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additionally, we utilize deep learning methods, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to analyze trends in the area of coronal holes and predict their areas across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By examining time series data, we aim to identify patterns in coronal hole behavior and understand their potential effects on space weather. This research enhances our ability to anticipate and prepare for space weather events that could affect Earth's technological systems.</description>

      <title>Inter-planetary type-IV solar radio bursts: A comprehensive catalog and statistical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decameter hectometric (DH; 1-14 MHz) type-IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in post-flare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the CMEs. From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectro-temporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type-IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) instruments onboard Wind and STEREO spacecraft, covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO mission between November 1996 and May 2023. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (&gt;900 km/s) and wide (&gt;60$^o$) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km/s. All DH type-IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within $\pm$45$^o$. 77 events had multi-vantage point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there was good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type-IV burst is best viewed when observed within $\pm$60$^o$ line of sight. Also, the bursts with a duration above 120 min, have source longitudes within $\pm$60$^o$. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type-IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a sun-as-a-star DH type-IV burst database.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution imaging survey of massive young stellar objects in the Magellanic Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraints on the binary fraction of young massive stellar objects (mYSOs) are important for binary and massive star formation theory. Here, we present speckle imaging of 34 mYSOs located in the Large (1/2 $Z_{\odot}$) and Small Magellanic Clouds ($\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$), probing projected separations between the 2000-20000 au (at angular scales of 0.02-0.2") range, for stars above 8 $M_{\odot}$. We find two wide binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (from a sample of 23 targets), but none in a sample of 11 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, leading us to adopt a wide binary fraction of 9$\pm$5%, and $&lt;$5%, respectively. We rule out a wide binary fraction greater than 35% in the Large, and 38% in the Small Magellanic Cloud at the 99% confidence level. This is in contrast to the wide binary fraction of mYSOs in the Milky Way (presumed $Z_{\odot}$), which within the physical parameter space probed by this study is $\sim$15-60% from the literature. We argue that while selection effects could be responsible for the lower binary fraction observed; it is more likely that there are underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed properties. This indicates that metallicity and environmental effects may influence the formation of wide binaries among massive stars. Future larger, statistically more significant samples of high-mass systems in low-metallicity environments, and for comparison in the Milky Way, are essential to confirm or repudiate our claim.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence of hybrid nature of EUV waves and the reflection of the fast-mode wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed an analysis of the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave event on 2022 March 31. The event originated from active region (AR) 12975 located at N13W52 in the field of view of the Atmospheric imaging Assembly (AIA) and exactly at the west limb viewed by the EUV Imager (EUVI) of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) satellite. The EUV wave was associated with an M9.6 class flare. The event was also well observed by MLSO and COR1 coronagraphs. We revealed here evident coexistence of two components of EUV waves in AIA as well as in EUVI images i.e., a fast-mode wave and a nonwave, which was predicted by the EUV wave hybrid model. The speeds of the fast-mode and non wave EUV wave components in AIA varies from ~430 to 658 km/s and ~157 to 205 km/s, respectively. The computed speeds in STEREO-A for the fast-mode wave and nonwave components are ~520 and ~152 km/s, respectively. Another wave emanated from the source AR and interacted with ambient coronal loops, showing evident reflection in the EUV images above the solar limb. The speed of the reflected wave in the plane of the sky is ~175 km/s. With the precise alignments, we found that the fast-mode EUV wave is just ahead of the coronal mass ejection (CME) and the nonwave component is cospatial with the frontal loop of the accompanied CME. The event also showed stationary fronts.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel treatment of $^7\mathrm{Li}(n,\gamma)^8\mathrm{Li}$ in effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The E1 contribution to the capture reaction $^7\mathrm{Li}(n,\gamma)^8\mathrm{Li}$ is calculated at low energies. We employ a coupled-channel formalism to account for the $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ excited core contribution. We develop a halo effective field theory power counting where capture in the spin $S=2$ channel is enhanced over the $S=1$ channel. A next-to-leading order calculation is presented where the excited core contribution is shown to affect only the overall normalization of the cross section. The momentum dependence of the capture cross section, as a consequence, is the same in a theory with or without the excited $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ degree of freedom at this order of the calculation. The kinematical signature of the $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ core is negligible at momenta below 1 MeV and significant only beyond the $3^+$ resonance energy, though still compatible with a next-to-next-to-leading order correction. We compare our formalism with a previous halo effective field theory calculation [Zhang, Nollett, and Phillips, Phys. Rev. C 89, 024613 (2014)] that also treated the $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ core as an explicit degree of freedom. Our formal expressions and analysis disagree with this earlier work in several aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.13003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The E1 and M1 contributions to $^7\mathrm{Be}(p,\gamma)^8\mathrm{B}$ at low energies are calculated in halo effective field theory. The excited $^7\mathrm{Be}^\star$ core is included as an explicit degree of freedom in a coupled-channels calculation. The E1 transition is calculated up to next-to-next-to-leading order. The leading contribution from M1 transition that gives significant contribution in a narrow energy region around the $1^+$ resonance state of $^8$B is included. We compare our results with previous halo effective field theory calculations that also included the $^7\mathrm{Be}^\star$ as an explicit degree of freedom. We disagree with these previous calculations in both the formal expressions and also in the analysis. Bayesian inference of the data gives $S_{17}(0)=21.0(7)$ eV b when combined with the expected theory error.</description>

      <title>Stellar metallicity is a key parameter for the search of Life in the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in the search for life.</description>

      <title>Rebuilding the Habitable Zone from the Bottom Up with Computational Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computation, if treated as a set of physical processes that act on information represented by states of matter, encompasses biological systems, digital systems, and other constructs, and may be a fundamental measure of living systems. The opportunity for biological computation, represented in the propagation and selection-driven evolution of information-carrying organic molecular structures, has been partially characterized in terms of planetary habitable zones based on primary conditions such as temperature and the presence of liquid water. A generalization of this concept to computational zones is proposed, with constraints set by three principal characteristics: capacity (including computation rates), energy, and instantiation (or substrate, including spatial extent). Computational zones naturally combine traditional habitability factors, including those associated with biological function that incorporate the chemical milieu, constraints on nutrients and free energy, as well as element availability. Two example applications are presented by examining the fundamental thermodynamic work efficiency and Landauer limit of photon-driven biological computation on planetary surfaces and of generalized computation in stellar energy capture structures (a.k.a. Dyson structures). It is suggested that computational zones involving nested structures or substellar objects could manifest unique observational signatures as cool far-infrared emitters. While these latter scenarios are entirely hypothetical, they offer a useful, complementary, introduction to the potential universality of computational zones.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that filamentary structures are representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds and support a filament paradigm for star formation, potentially accounting for the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Using Herschel imaging observations of the California giant molecular cloud, we aim to further investigate the filament paradigm for low- to intermediate-mass star formation and to better understand the exact role of filaments in the origin of stellar masses. Using the multiscale, multiwavelength extraction method getsf, we identify starless cores, protostars, and filaments in the Herschel data set and separate these components from the background cloud contribution to determine accurate core and filament properties. Both the prestellar core mass function (CMF) and the distribution of filament masses per unit length or filament line mass function (FLMF) are consistent with power-law distributions at the high-mass end, $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log}M\propto M^{-1.4 \pm 0.2}$ at $M &gt; 1\,M_\odot$ for the CMF and $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log} {M}_{\rm line} \propto {M}_{\rm line}^{-1.5\pm0.2}$ for the FLMF at $M_{\rm line} &gt; 10\,M_\odot {\rm pc^{-1}}$, which are both consistent with the Salpeter power-law IMF. Based on these results, we propose a revised model for the origin of the CMF in filaments, whereby the global prestellar CMF in a molecular cloud arises from the integration of the CMFs generated by individual thermally supercritical filaments within the cloud. Our findings support the existence a tight connection between the FLMF and the CMF/IMF and suggests that filamentary structures represent a critical evolutionary step in establishing a Salpeter-like mass function.</description>
