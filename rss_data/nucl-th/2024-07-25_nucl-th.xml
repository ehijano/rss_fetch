      <title>Investigating the rate of $^{10}$Be(n,$\gamma$)$^{11}$Be radiative capture reaction within the FRDWBA framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the radiative capture of a neutron by $^{10}$Be using the Coulomb dissociation approach within the FRDWBA theory. We analyze the elastic Coulomb breakup of $^{11}$Be on a $^{208}$Pb target at 72 MeV/A to determine the photodisintegration cross-section and radiative capture cross-section. Utilizing the Maxwell-averaged velocity distribution, we calculate the resulting radiative neutron capture reaction rate for the $^{10}$Be(n,$\gamma$)$^{11}$Be reaction. Comparative analyses are conducted with experimental data, theoretical results from direct radiative capture methods, and transfer reaction calculations. Additionally, we contrast our findings with the existing $^{10}$Be($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{14}$C reaction rate and conclude the dominance of neutron capture over $\alpha$ capture by $^{10}$Be.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory: closed-form constraint on the average particle number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory (BMBPT) relying on the breaking of U(1) global gauge symmetry has been recently formulated and applied to extend the applicability of standard perturbation theory to ab initio calculations of atomic nuclei away from shell closures. So far, practical applications have been limited to second-order calculations due to the lack of a generic algorithm to constrain the average particle number of the symmetry-broken state. This limitation is presently lifted and a general BMBPT formalism is presented that allows to constrain the particle-number expectation value at arbitrary order P. The constraint can be incorporated in closed form by solving a polynomial equation of degree P-1. The numerical procedure is illustrated through BMBPT(3) calculations of calcium isotopes using a nuclear Hamiltonian derived within chiral effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of Asymptotically Hot and Dense QCD Matter: AMY Formalism vs. A Modified Relaxation Time Approximation in 0-flavor SU(3) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the ``modified'' $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures associated with collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>

      <title>Pauli nonlocality and the nucleon effective mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of the nucleon mean-field potential in nuclear matter (NM) is done within an extended Hartree-Fock (HF) formalism, using the CDM3Y6 density dependent version of the M3Y interaction which is associated with the nuclear incompressibility $K\simeq 252$ MeV. The momentum dependence of nucleon optical potential (OP) in NM at the saturation density $\rho_0$ is shown to be due mainly to its exchange term up to $k\approx 2$ fm$^{-1}$, so that the Pauli nonlocality is expected to be the main origin of the nucleon effective mass at low momenta. Because nucleons in neutron-rich NM at $\rho\approx \rho_0$ are either weakly bound or unbound by the in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction, the determination of the effective mass of nucleon scattered on targets with neutron excess at low energies should be of interest for the mean-field studies of neutron star matter. For this purpose, the folding model is used to calculate the nonlocal nucleon OP for the optical model analysis of elastic nucleon scattering on $^{40,48}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr, and $^{208}$Pb targets at energies $E&lt;50$ MeV, to probe the model reliability and validate the WKB local approximation to obtain the local folded nucleon OP. The nucleon effective mass $m^*$ is then carefully deduced from the momentum dependence of the local folded nucleon OP which is resulted from the Pauli nonlocality of the exchange term. The neutron-proton effective mass splitting determined at $\rho\approx\rho_0$ from the central strength of the real folded nucleon OP for $^{48}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr, and $^{208}$Pb targets has been found to depend linearly on the neutron-proton asymmetry parameter as $m^*_{n-p}\approx (0.167\pm 0.018)\delta$, in a good agreement with the recent empirical constraints.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of deltaful two-pion exchange nuclear forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of the delta isobar degrees of freedom in nucleon-nucleon scattering is revisited. We attempt to understand why the dimensionally regularized two-pion exchanges with the explicit delta isobar is much stronger than the ones with spectral function regularization. When the cutoff value of spectral function regularization is varied, the isoscalar central component exhibits a rather large cutoff variation. This reveals a surprisingly large numerical factor of the deltaful two-pion exchange potentials. The power counting is adjusted accordingly and we discuss the results and how to improve upon this finding.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic ab initio methods for infinite nuclear matter with modern chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative study of the equation of state for pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter is presented using three ab initio methods based on diagrammatic expansions: coupled-cluster theory, self-consistent Green's functions, and many-body perturbation theory. We critically evaluate these methods by employing different chiral potentials at next-to-next-to-leading-order -- all of which include both two- and three-nucleon contributions -- and by exploring various many-body truncations. Our investigation yields highly precise results for pure neutron matter and robust predictions for symmetric nuclear matter, particularly with soft interactions. Moreover, the new calculations demonstrate that the $\rm{ NNLO_{sat} }(450)$ and $\Delta \rm{NNLO_{go}}(394)$ potentials are consistent with the empirical constraints on the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, this benchmark study reveals that diagrammatic expansions with similar architectures lead to consistent many-body correlations, even when applied across different methods. This consistency underscores the robustness of the diagrammatic approach in capturing the essential physics of nucleonic systems.</description>

      <title>Nucleon pair parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are important quantities in describing nucleon structures. They are universal and process-independent. As a matter of fact, nucleon PDFs are inevitably affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. In order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), in this paper, we introduce the nucleon pair PDFs (dPDFs) to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which is confined to a nucleus. We first of all construct the nuclear state in terms of nucleonic Fock states and calculate the operator definition of nPDFs. Neglecting the higher order corrections or nucleon correlations, we find that nPDFs can be written as a sum of two terms which respectively correspond to PDFs and dPDFs. Nucleon pair PDFs which stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation are proportional to common nucleon PDFs but suppressed by a factor. It is naturally to obtain the slope of the EMC effect $dR_{EMC}/dx$ as long as the factor is independent of momentum fraction $x$. We further calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratio to study the nuclear matter effect on the extraction of weak mixing angle or $\sin^2\theta_W$ by using dPDFs.</description>

      <title>Explicitly correlated Gaussians with tensor pre-factors: analytic matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a specific form of explicitly correlated Gaussians -- with tensor pre-factors -- which appear naturally when dealing with certain few-body systems in nuclear and particle physics. We derive analytic matrix elements with these Gaussians -- overlap, kinetic energy, and Coulomb potential -- to be used in variational calculations of those systems. We also perform a quick test of the derived formulae by applying them to p- and d-waves of the hydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>Fine-structure constant sensitivity of the Th-229 nuclear clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-resolved laser spectroscopy at the 10$^{-12}$ precision level recently reported in $arXiv$:2406.18719 determined the fractional change in nuclear quadrupole moment between the ground and isomeric state of $^{229}\rm{Th}$, $\Delta Q_0/Q_0$=1.791(2) %. Assuming a prolate spheroid nucleus, this allows to quantify the sensitivity of the nuclear transition frequency to variations of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ to $K=5900(2300)$, with the uncertainty dominated by the experimentally measured charge radius difference $\Delta \langle r^2 \rangle$ between the ground and isomeric state. This result indicates a three orders of magnitude enhancement over atomic clock schemes based on electron shell transitions. We find that $\Delta Q_0$ is highly sensitive to tiny changes in the nuclear volume, thus the constant volume approximation cannot be used to accurately relate changes in $\langle r^2 \rangle$ and $Q_0$. The difference between the experimental and estimated values in $\Delta Q_0/Q_0$ raises a further question on the octupole contribution to the alpha-sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Impact parameter dependence of anisotropic flow: Bayesian reconstruction in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peculiar phenomena have been observed in analyses of anisotropic flow ($v_n$) fluctuations in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions: The fourth-order cumulant of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) distribution changes sign. In addition, the ATLAS collaboration has shown that cumulants of $v_n$ fluctuations of all orders depend significantly on the centrality estimator. We show that these peculiarities are due to the fact that the impact parameter $b$ always spans a finite range for a fixed value of the centrality estimator. We provide a quantitative determination of this range through a simple Bayesian analysis. We obtain excellent fits of STAR and ATLAS data, with a few parameters, by assuming that the probability distribution of $v_n$ solely depends on $b$ at a given centrality. This probability distribution is almost Gaussian, and its parameters depend smoothly on $b$, in a way that is constrained by symmetry and scaling laws. We reconstruct, thus, the impact parameter dependence of the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane in a model-independent manner, and assess the robustness of the extraction using Monte Carlo simulations of the collisions where the impact parameter is known. We argue that the non-Gaussianity of $v_n$ fluctuations gives direct information on the hydrodynamic response to initial anisotropies, ATLAS data being consistent with a smaller response for $n=4$ than for $n=2$ and $n=3$, in agreement with hydrodynamic calculations.</description>

      <title>Probing collectivity in heavy-ion collisions with fluctuations of the $p_T$ spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations in the initial stages of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions depend little on rapidity. The hydrodynamic expansion which occurs in later stages then gives rise to correlations among outgoing particles which depend weakly on their relative rapidity. Azimuthal correlations, through which anisotropic flow ($v_n(p_T)$) is defined, have been the most studied. Here we study a new observable introduced in 2020 by Schenke, Shen and Teaney and dubbed $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change in the $p_T$ spectrum induced by a fluctuation. We describe how it can be measured. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we make quantitative predictions for $v_0(p_T)$ of charged and identified hadrons. We then discuss how $v_0(p_T)$ relates to two phenomena which have been measured: The increase of the mean transverse momentum in ultracentral collisions, and the event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[ p_T]$. We show that $v_0(p_T)$ determines the dependence of these quantities on the $p_T$ cuts implemented in the analysis. We quantitatively explain the rise of $\sigma_{p_T}$ observed by ATLAS as the upper $p_T$-cut is increased from $2$ to $5$~GeV/$c$.</description>

      <title>Wave function of $^9$Be in the three-body (alpha-alpha-n)-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple analytic expression of the three-body wave function describing the system $(\alpha\alpha n)$ in the ground state $\frac{3}{2}^-$ of ${}^9\mathrm{Be}$ is obtained. In doing this, it is assumed that the $\alpha$ particles interact with each other via the $S$-wave Ali-Bodmer potential including the Coulomb term, and the neutron-$\alpha$ forces act only in the $P$-wave state. This wave function is constructed by trial and error method via solving in this way a kind of inverse problem when the two-body $\alpha\alpha$ potential is recovered from a postulated three-body wave function. As a result, the wave function is an exact solution of the corresponding three-body Schr\"odinger equation for experimentally known binding energy and for the $\alpha\alpha$ potential whose difference from the Ali-Bodmer one is minimized by varying the adjustable parameters which the postulated wave function depends on.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is expected to have a first order phase transition between the confined hadron gas and the deconfined quark gluon plasma at high baryon densities. This will result in phase boundary effects in the metastable and unstable regions. It is important to include these effects in phenomenological models of heavy ion collisions to identify experimental signatures of a phase transition. This requires building intuition on phase separation in rapidly expanding fluids. In this work we present the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics with a phase boundary, provide prescriptions to extend the equation of state to metastable and unstable regions, and show the effects of spinodal separation in a Bjorken flow.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors in kinetic theory for a mixture of quark and gluon fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exactly solve a Boltzmann equation that describes the dynamics of coupled massless quark and gluon fluids undergoing transversally homogeneous longitudinal boost-invariant expansion. We include a fugacity parameter that allows quarks to be out of chemical equilibrium and we account for the different collision rates of quarks and gluons, which are related by Casimir scaling. Based on these assumptions, we numerically determine the evolution of a large set of moments of the quark and gluon distribution functions and reconstruct their entire distribution functions. We find that both late and early-time attractors exist for all moments of the distribution functions containing more than one power of the squared longitudinal momentum. These attractors emerge long before the system reaches the regime where hydrodynamic approximations apply. In addition, we discuss how the shear viscous corrections and entropy density of the fluid mixture evolve and consider the properties of their respective attractors. Finally, the entropy production is also investigated for different initial values of momentum anisotropy and quark abundance.</description>

      <title>A soft-hard framework with exact four momentum conservation for small systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new framework, called x-scape, for the combined study of both hard and soft transverse momentum sectors in high energy proton-proton ($p$-$p$) and proton-nucleus ($p$-$A$) collisions is set up. A dynamical initial state is set up using the 3d-Glauber model with transverse locations of hotspots within each incoming nucleon. A hard scattering that emanates from two colliding hotspots is carried out using the Pythia generator. Initial state radiation from the incoming hard partons is carried out in a new module called I-matter, which includes the longitudinal location of initial splits. The energy-momentum of both the initial hard partons and their associated beam remnants is removed from the hot spots, depleting the energy-momentum available for the formation of the bulk medium. Outgoing showers are simulated using the matter generator, and results are presented for both cases, allowing for and not allowing for energy loss. First comparisons between this hard-soft model and single inclusive hadron and jet data from $p$-$p$ and minimum bias $p$-$Pb$ collisions are presented. Single hadron spectra in $p$-$p$ are used to carry out a limited (in number of parameters) Bayesian calibration of the model. Fair comparisons with data are indicative of the utility of this new framework. Theoretical studies of the correlation between jet $p_T$ and event activity at mid and forward rapidity are carried out.</description>

      <title>Towards heavy-mass ab initio nuclear structure: Open-shell Ca, Ni and Sn isotopes from Bogoliubov coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in nuclear many-body theory enabled the description of open-shell medium-mass nuclei from first principles by exploiting the spontaneous breaking of symmetries within correlation expansion methods. Once combined with systematically improvable inter-nucleon interactions consistently derived from chiral effective field theory, modern ab initio nuclear structure calculations provide a powerful framework to deliver first-principle predictions accompanied with theoretical uncertainties. In this Letter, controlled ab initio Bogoliubov coupled cluster (BCC) calculations are performed for the first time, targeting the ground-state of all calcium, nickel and tin isotopes up to mass A ~ 180. While showing good agreement with available experimental data, the shell structure evolution in neutron-rich isotopes and the location of the neutron drip-lines are predicted. The BCC approach constitutes a key development towards reliable first-principles simulations of heavy-mass open-shell nuclei.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Equation of state of nuclear matter from collective flows and stopping in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equation of state of nuclear matter, momentum dependence of the effective interaction and in-medium modification of elastic nucleon-nucleon cross-sections are studied by comparing theoretical predictions for stopping, directed and elliptic flows of protons and light clusters in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions of beam energy between 150 and 800 MeV/nucleon to experimental data gathered by the FOPI Collaboration. A multivariate analysis that takes into account systematic uncertainties induced on model predictions by the coalescence afterburner leads to the following constraint for the equation of state at 68 percent confidence level: compressibility modulus of isospin symmetric matter $K_0=230^{+9}_{-11}$ MeV and slope of the symmetry energy $L=63^{+10}_{-13}$ MeV. The momentum dependence of the isoscalar potential is found to be similar to that of the empirical optical potential, with an effective isoscalar mass $m^*=0.695^{+0.014}_{-0.018}$. The isovector potential displays a momentum dependence corresponding to a positive neutron-proton effective mass difference $\Delta m^*_{np}=(0.17^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\delta$, close to the world average for this quantity. A suppression of elastic nucleon-nucleon cross-sections in symmetric nuclear matter at saturation by about 60$\%$ relative to vacuum values is deduced, in qualitative agreement with microscopical results. A strong dependence of the suppression factor on isospin asymmetry is evidenced, experimental data for isospin symmetric systems proving crucial for this last conclusion.</description>

      <title>The f0(1370) controversy from dispersive meson-meson scattering data analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence of the long-debated $f_0(1370)$ resonance in the dispersive analyses of meson-meson scattering data. For this, we present a novel approach using forward dispersion relations, valid for generic inelastic resonances. We find its pole at $(1245\pm 40)- i\,(300^{+30}_{-70})$ MeV in $\pi\pi$ scattering. We also provide the couplings as well as further checks extrapolating partial-wave dispersion relations or with other continuation methods. A pole at $(1380^{+70}_{-60})-i\,(220^{+80}_{-70})$ MeV also appears in the $\pi\pi\to K\bar K$ data analysis with partial-wave dispersion relations. Despite settling its existence, our model-independent dispersive and analytic methods still show a lingering tension between pole parameters from the $\pi\pi$ and $K\bar K$ channels that should be attributed to data.</description>

      <title>Pressure and speed of sound in two-flavor color-superconducting quark matter at next-to-leading order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quark matter at asymptotically high densities is weakly coupled, due to the asymptotic freedom of Quantum Chromodynamics. In this weak-coupling regime, bulk thermodynamic properties of quark matter, assuming a trivial ground state, are currently known to partial next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. However, the ground state at high densities is expected to be a color superconductor, in which the excitation spectrum of (at least some) quarks exhibit a gap with a non-perturbative dependence on the strong coupling. In this work, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of color-superconducting quark matter at high densities and zero temperature at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the coupling in the presence of a finite gap. We work in the limit of two massless quark flavors, which corresponds to deconfined symmetric nuclear matter, and further assume that the gap is small compared to the quark chemical potential. In these limits, we find that the NLO corrections to the pressure and speed of sound are comparable in size to the leading-order effects of the gap, and further increase both quantities above their values for non-superconducting quark matter. We also provide a parameterization of the NLO speed of sound to guide phenomenology in the high-density region, and we furthermore comment on whether our findings should be expected to extend to the case of three-flavor quark matter of relevance to neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rates of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1}$ and $X(3872)\to \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ decays are estimated in the model of the triangle loop diagrams with charmed $D^*\bar DD$ and $\bar D^*D\bar D$ mesons in the loops. There are the triangle logarithmic singularities in the physical region of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0 \chi_{c1}$ decay which manifest themselves as narrow peaks in the $\pi^0\chi_{c1}$ mass spectrum near the $D^0\bar D^0$ threshold. The model predicts approximately the same branching fractions of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0 \chi_{c1}$ and $X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ decays at the level of about (0.8-1.7)$\times10^{-4}$. A distinct prediction of the model is the value of the ratio $\mathcal{R}= \mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1})/\mathcal{B}(X(3872) \to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1})\approx1.1$. It weakly depends on the $X(3872)$ resonance parameters and indicates a significant violation of the isotopic symmetry according to which one would expect $\mathcal{R}=2$.</description>

      <title>Lattice study on finite density QC$_2$D towards zero temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) at low temperature ($T = 40$ MeV, $32^4$ lattice) for the purpose of extending our previous works~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2022hyy} at $T=80$ MeV ($16^4$ lattice). Indeed, a rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential $\mu$ has been revealed, but finite volume effects in a high-density regime sometimes cause a wrong understanding. Therefore, it is important to investigate the temperature dependence down to zero temperature with large-volume simulations. By performing $32^4$ simulations, we obtain essentially similar results to the previous ones, but we are now allowed to get a fine understanding of the phase structure via the temperature dependence. Most importantly, we find that the hadronic-matter phase, which is composed of thermally excited hadrons, shrinks with decreasing temperature and that the diquark condensate scales as $\langle qq \rangle \propto \mu^2$ in the BCS phase, a property missing at $T=80$ MeV. From careful analyses, furthermore, we confirm a tentative conclusion that the topological susceptibility is independent of $\mu$. We also show the temperature dependence of the pressure, internal energy, and sound velocity as a function of $\mu$. The pressure increases around the hadronic-superfluid phase transition more rapidly at the lower temperature, while the temperature dependence of the sound velocity is invisible. Breaking of the conformal bound is also confirmed thanks to the smaller statistical error.</description>

      <title>Triply charm and bottom tetraquarks in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singly, doubly and fully charmed tetraquark candidates, \emph{e.g.}, $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$, $T^+_{cc}(3875)$ and $X(6900)$ have been recently reported by the LHCb collaboration. Therefore, it is timely to implement a theoretical investigation on triply heavy tetraquark systems; herein, the S-wave triply charm and bottom tetraquarks, $\bar{Q}Q\bar{q}Q$ $(q=u,\,d,\,s;\,Q=c,\,b)$, with spin-parity $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$, isospin $I=0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, are systematically studied in a constituent quark model. Besides, all tetraquark configurations, \emph{i.e.} meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type arrangements, along with any allowed color structure, are comprehensively considered. The Gaussian expansion method (GEM), in combination with the complex-scaling method (CSM), which is quite ingenious in dealing with either bound or resonances, is the approach adopted in solving the complex scaled Schr\"odinger equation. This theoretical framework has already been applied in various tetra- and penta-quark systems. In a fully coupled-channel calculation within the GEM$+$CSM, narrow resonances are found in each $I(J^P)$ channel of the charm and bottom sector. In particular, triply charm and bottom tetraquark resonances are obtained in $5.6-5.9$ GeV and $15.3-15.7$ GeV, respectively. We provide also some insights of the compositeness of these exotic states, such as the inner quark distance, magnetic moment and dominant wave function component. All this may help to distinguish them in future high energy nuclear and particle experiments.</description>
