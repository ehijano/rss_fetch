      <title>Connected matching in graphs with independence number two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matching $M$ in a graph $G$ is {\em connected} if $G$ has an edge linking each pair of edges in $M$. The problem to find large connected matchings in graphs $G$ with $\alpha(G)=2$ is closely related to Hadwiger's conjecture for graphs with independence number 2. The problem of finding a large connected matching in a general graph is NP-hard. F{\"u}redi et al. in 2005 conjectured that each $(4t-1)$-vertex graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)=2$ contains a connected matching of size at least $t$. Cambie recently showed that if this conjecture is false, then so is Hadwiger's conjecture. In this paper, we present a number of properties possessed by a counterexample to F{\"u}redi et al.'s conjecture, and then using these properties, we prove that F{\"u}redi et al.'s conjecture holds for $t\leq22$.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many minimally Ramsey size-linear graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be Ramsey size-linear if $r(G,H) =O_G (e(H))$ for every graph $H$ with no isolated vertices. Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp observed that $K_4$ is not Ramsey size-linear, but each of its proper subgraphs is, and they asked whether there exist infinitely many such graphs. In this short note, we answer this question in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Counting List Colorings of Unlabeled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic enumerative functions for counting colorings of a graph $G$, such as the chromatic polynomial $P(G,k)$, do so under the assumption that the given graph is labeled. In 1985, Hanlon defined and studied the chromatic polynomial for an unlabeled graph $\mathcal{G}$, $P(\mathcal{G}, k)$. Determining $P(\mathcal{G}, k)$ amounts to counting colorings under the action of automorphisms of $\mathcal{G}$. In this paper, we consider the problem of counting list colorings of unlabeled graphs. List coloring of graphs is a widely studied generalization of classic coloring that was introduced by Vizing and by Erd\H{o}s, Rubin, and Taylor in the 1970s. In 1990, Kostochka and Sidorenko introduced the list color function $P_\ell(G,k)$ which is the guaranteed number of list colorings of a labeled graph $G$ over all $k$-list assignments of $G$. In this paper, we extend Hanlon's definition to the list context and define the unlabeled list color function, $P_\ell(\mathcal{G}, k)$, of an unlabeled graph $\mathcal{G}$. In this context, we pursue a fundamental question whose analogues have driven much of the research on counting list colorings and its generalizations: For a given unlabeled graph $\mathcal{G}$, does $P_\ell(\mathcal{G}, k) = P(\mathcal{G}, k)$ when $k$ is large enough? We show the answer to this question is yes for a large class of unlabeled graphs that include point-determining graphs (also known as irreducible graphs and as mating graphs).</description>

      <title>Sharp Bounds for Generalized Zagreb Indices of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last forty years, many scientists used graph theory to develop mathematical models for analyzing structures and properties of various chemical compounds. In this paper, we will establish formulas and bounds for generalized first Zagreb Index and coindex, which are based on degrees of vertices. In addition, for triangle and quadrangle free graphs, we will establish formulas and bounds for generalized first leap Zagreb Index and coindex, which are based on 2-distance degrees of vertices. Additionally, we will establish sharp bounds of generalized first Zagreb index and the leap index for various types of graphs and provide examples for which the sharp bounds are attained. In addition, we will find regression models and compare the first Zagreb index and the first leap Zagreb index for predicting some physicochemical properties of certain chemical compounds, benzenoid hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>On the structure of extremal point-line arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that extremal Szemer\'{e}di-Trotter configurations are rigid in the following sense: If $P,L$ are sets of points and lines determining at least $C|P|^{2/3}|L|^{2/3}$ incidences, then there exists a collection $P'$ of points of size at most $k = k_0(C)$ such that, heuristically, fixing those points fixes a positive fraction of the arrangement. That is, the incidence structure and a small number of points determine a large part of the arrangement. The key tools we use are the Guth-Katz polynomial partitioning, and also a result of Dvir, Garg, Oliveira and Solymosi that was used to show the rigidity of near-Sylvester-Gallai configurations.</description>

      <title>On the joint embedding property for cographs and trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$ is said to have the joint embedding property (JEP) if for every $G_1, G_2\in \mathcal{F}$, there is an $H\in \mathcal{F}$ that contains both $G_1$ and $G_2$ as induced subgraphs. If $\mathcal{F}$ is given by a finite set $S$ of forbidden induced subgraphs, it is known that determining if $\mathcal{F}$ has JEP is undecidable. We prove that this problem is decidable if $P_4\in S$ and generalize this result to families of rooted labeled trees under topological containment, bounded treewidth families under the graph minor relation, and bounded cliquewidth families under the induced subgraph relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06138v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown by Kutnar and \v Sparl in 2009 that every connected vertex-transitive graph of order $6p$, where $p$ is a prime, contains a Hamilton path. In this paper, it will be shown that every such graph contains a Hamilton cycle, except for the triangle-replaced graph of the Petersen graph.</description>

      <title>Involution matrix loci and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space of $n \times n$ complex matrices with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]$. We define graded quotients of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]$ which carry an action of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ by simultaneous permutation of rows and columns. These quotient rings are obtained by applying the orbit harmonics method to matrix loci corresponding to all involutions in $\mathfrak{S}_n$ and the conjugacy classes of involutions in $\mathfrak{S}_n$ with a given number of fixed points. In the case of perfect matchings on $\{1, \dots, n\}$ with $n$ even, the Hilbert series of our quotient ring is related to Tracy-Widom distributions and its graded Frobenius image gives a refinement of the plethysm $s_{n/2}[s_2]$.</description>

      <title>Gallai's Path Decomposition of Levi Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallai's path decomposition conjecture states that for a connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, there exist a path decomposition of size $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$. Levi graph of order one, denoted by $L_{1}(m,k)$ is a bipartite graph having vertex partition $(A,B)$, where $A$ is the collection of all $k-1$ subsets of $[m]$ and $B$ is the collection of all $k$ subsets of $[m]$. In this graph a $k-1$ set is adjacent to a $k$ set if it is properly contained inside the $k$ set. Path number of a graph $G$ is the minimum size of its path decomposition. Hence, we can rewrite the Gallai conjecture as the path number of a connected graph is at most $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$. In this work we prove conjecture on $L_{1}(m,k)$ for all $m \ge 2 $, $2 \le k \le m$. Moreover determines the path number of $L_{1}(m,2)$ for all $m$.</description>

      <title>Curvature and local matchings of conference graphs and extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm a conjecture of Bonini et. al. on the precise Lin-Lu-Yau curvature values of conference graphs, i.e., strongly regular graphs with parameters $(4\gamma+1,2\gamma,\gamma-1,\gamma)$, with $\gamma\geq 2$. Our method only depends on the parameter relations and applies to more general classes of amply regular graphs. In particular, we develop a new combinatorial method for showing the existence of local perfect matchings. A key observation is that counting common neighbors leads to useful quadratic polynomials. Our result also leads to an interesting number theoretic consequence on quadratic residues.</description>

      <title>New bounds for the optimal density of covering single-insertion codes via the Tur\'an density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the density of any covering single-insertion code $C\subseteq X^r$ over the $n$-symbol alphabet $X$ cannot be smaller than $1/r+\delta_r$ for some positive real $\delta_r$ not depending on $n$. This improves the volume lower bound of $1/(r+1)$. On the other hand, we observe that, for all sufficiently large $r$, if $n$ tends to infinity then the asymptotic upper bound of $7/(r+1)$ due to Lenz et al (2021) can be improved to $4.911/(r+1)$.
  Both the lower and the upper bounds are achieved by relating the code density to the Tur\'an density from extremal combinatorics. For the last task, we use the analytic framework of measurable subsets of the real cube $[0,1]^r$.</description>

      <title>Piercing intersecting convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume two finite families $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ have the property that $A\cap B\ne \emptyset$ for every $A \in \mathcal A$ and $B\in \mathcal B$. Is there a constant $\gamma &gt;0$ (independent of $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$) such that there is a line intersecting $\gamma|\mathcal A|$ sets in $\mathcal A$ or $\gamma|\mathcal B|$ sets in $\mathcal B$? This is an intriguing Helly-type question from a paper by Mart\'{i}nez, Roldan and Rubin. We confirm this in the special case when all sets in $\mathcal A$ lie in parallel planes and all sets in $\mathcal B$ lie in parallel planes; in fact, all sets from one of the two families has a line transversal.</description>

      <title>On the oriented diameter of graphs with given minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s, Pach, Pollack, and Tuza [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 47(1) (1989), 73--79] proved that the diameter of a connected $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree $\delta$ is at most $\frac{3n}{\delta+1}+O(1)$. The oriented diameter of an undirected graph $G$, denoted by $\overrightarrow{diam}(G)$, is the minimum diameter of a strongly connected orientation of $G$. Bau and Dankelmann [European J. Combin., 49 (2015), 126--133] showed that for every bridgeless $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta$, $\overrightarrow{diam}(G) \leq \frac{11n}{\delta+1}+9$. They also showed an infinite family of graphs with oriented diameter at least $\frac{3n}{\delta+1} + O(1)$ and posed the problem of determining the smallest possible value $c$ for which $\overrightarrow{diam}(G) \leq c \cdot\frac{3n}{\delta+1}+O(1)$ holds. In this paper, we show that the smallest value $c$ such that the upper bound above holds for all $\delta\geq 2$ is $1$, which is best possible.</description>

      <title>Analogues of Bermond-Bollob\'as Conjecture for Cages Yield Expander Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a possible link between Cages and Expander Graphs by introducing three interconnected variants of the Bermond and Bollob\'as Conjecture, originally formulated in 1981 within the context of the Degree/Diameter Problem. We adapt these conjectures to cages, with the most robust variant posed as follows: Does there exist a constant $c$ such that for every pair of parameters $(k,g)$ there exists a $k$-regular graph of girth $g$ and order not exceeding $ M(k,g) + c $?; where $M(k,g)$ denotes the value of the so-called Moore bound for cages. We show that a positive answer to any of the three variants of the Bermond and Bollob\'as Conjecture for cages considered in our paper would yield expander graphs (expander families); thereby establishing a connection between Cages and Expander Graphs.</description>

      <title>Random embeddings of bounded degree trees with optimal spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A seminal result of Koml\'os, S\'ark\"ozy, and Szemer\'edi states that any n-vertex graph G with minimum degree at least (1/2 + {\alpha})n contains every n-vertex tree T of bounded degree. Recently, Pham, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin extended this result to show that such graphs G in fact support an optimally spread distribution on copies of a given T, which implies, using the recent breakthroughs on the Kahn-Kalai conjecture, the robustness result that T is a subgraph of sparse random subgraphs of G as well. Pham, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin construct their optimally spread distribution by following closely the original proof of the Koml\'os-S\'ark\"ozy-Szemer\'edi theorem which uses the blow-up lemma and the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma. We give an alternative, regularity-free construction that instead uses the Koml\'os-S\'ark\"ozy-Szemer\'edi theorem (which has a regularity-free proof due to Kathapurkar and Montgomery) as a black-box. Our proof is based on the simple and general insight that, if G has linear minimum degree, almost all constant sized subgraphs of G inherit the same minimum degree condition that G has.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Inequalities In Cluster Algebras Of Finite Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the notion of a multiplicative inequality among minors of a totally positive matrix, we describe, over full rank cluster algebras of finite type, the cone of Laurent monomials in cluster variables that are bounded as a real-valued function on the positive locus of the cluster variety. We prove that the extreme rays of this cone are the u-variables of the cluster algebra. Using this description, we prove that all bounded ratios are bounded by 1 and give a sufficient condition for all such ratios to be subtraction free. This allows us to show in Gr(2, n), Gr(3, 6), Gr(3, 7), Gr(3, 8) that every bounded Laurent monomial in Pl\"ucker coordinates factors into a positive integer combination of so-called primitive ratios. In Gr(4, 8) this factorization does not exists, but we provide the full list of extreme rays of the cone of bounded Laurent monomials in Pl\"ucker coordinates.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs of $K_r$-free graphs and the Erd\H{o}s--Rogers problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two graphs $F,H$ and a positive integer $n$, the function $f_{F,H}(n)$ denotes the largest $m$ such that every $H$-free graph on $n$ vertices contains an $F$-free induced subgraph on $m$ vertices. This function has been extensively studied in the last 60 years when $F$ and $H$ are cliques and became known as the Erd\H{o}s-Rogers function. Recently, Balogh, Chen and Luo, and Mubayi and Verstra\"ete initiated the systematic study of this function in the case where $F$ is a general graph.
  Answering, in a strong form, a question of Mubayi and Verstra\"ete, we prove that for every positive integer $r$ and every $K_{r-1}$-free graph $F$, there exists some $\varepsilon_F&gt;0$ such that $f_{F,K_r}(n)=O(n^{1/2-\varepsilon_F})$. This result is tight in two ways. Firstly, it is no longer true if $F$ contains $K_{r-1}$ as a subgraph. Secondly, we show that for all $r\geq 4$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists a $K_{r-1}$-free graph $F$ for which $f_{F,K_r}(n)=\Omega(n^{1/2-\varepsilon})$. Along the way of proving this, we show in particular that for every graph $F$ with minimum degree $t$, we have $f_{F,K_4}(n)=\Omega(n^{1/2-6/\sqrt{t}})$. This answers (in a strong form) another question of Mubayi and Verstra\"ete. Finally, we prove that there exist absolute constants $0&lt;c&lt;C$ such that for each $r\geq 4$, if $F$ is a bipartite graph with sufficiently large minimum degree, then $\Omega(n^{\frac{c}{\log r}})\leq f_{F,K_r}(n)\leq O(n^{\frac{C}{\log r}})$. This shows that for graphs $F$ with large minimum degree, the behaviour of $f_{F,K_r}(n)$ is drastically different from that of the corresponding off-diagonal Ramsey number $f_{K_2,K_r}(n)$.</description>

      <title>The structure of Hurwitz numbers with fixed ramification profile and varying genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1891, Hurwitz introduced the enumeration of genus $g$, degree $d$, branched covers of the Riemann sphere with simple ramification over prescribed points and no branching elsewhere. He showed that for fixed degree $d$, the enumeration possesses a remarkable structure. More precisely, it can be expressed as a linear combination of exponentials $m^{2g-2+2d}$, where $m$ ranges over the integers from $1$ to $\binom{d}{2}$.
  In this paper, we generalise this structural result to Hurwitz numbers that enumerate branched covers which also have a prescribed ramification profile over one point. Our proof fundamentally uses the infinite wedge space, in particular the connected correlators of products of $\mathcal{E}$-operators. The recent study of Hurwitz numbers has often focussed on their structure with fixed genus and varying ramification profile. Our main result is orthogonal to this, allowing for the explicit calculation and the asymptotic analysis of Hurwitz numbers in large genus.
  We pose the broad question of which other enumerative problems exhibit analogous structure. We prove that orbifold Hurwitz numbers can also be expressed as a linear combination of exponentials and conjecture that monotone Hurwitz numbers share a similar structure, but with the inclusion of an additional linear term.</description>

      <title>Square-free powers of Cohen-Macaulay forests, cycles, and whiskered cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $I(G)^{[k]}$ denote the $k^{th}$ square-free power of the edge ideal $I(G)$ of a graph $G$. In this article, we provide a precise formula for the depth of $I(G)^{[k]}$ when $G$ is a Cohen-Macaulay forest. Using this, we show that for a Cohen-Macaualy forest $G$, the $k^{th}$ square-free power of $I(G)$ is always Cohen-Macaulay, which is quite surprising since all ordinary powers of $I(G)$ can never be Cohen-Macaulay unless $G$ is a disjoint union of edges. Additionally, we provide tight bounds for the regularity and depth of $I(G)^{[k]}$ when $G$ is either a cycle or a whiskered cycle, which aids in identifying when such ideals have linear resolution. Furthermore, we provide combinatorial formulas for the depth of second square-free powers of edge ideals of cycles and whiskered cycles. We also obtained an explicit formula of the regularity of second square-free power for whiskered cycles.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing semi-directed level-1 networks using few quarnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-directed networks are partially directed graphs that model evolution where the directed edges represent reticulate evolutionary events. We present an algorithm that reconstructs binary $n$-leaf semi-directed level-1 networks in $O( n^2)$ time from its quarnets (4-leaf subnetworks). Our method assumes we have direct access to all quarnets, yet uses only an asymptotically optimal number of $O(n \log n)$ quarnets. Under group-based models of evolution with the Jukes-Cantor or Kimura 2-parameter constraints, it has been shown that only four-cycle quarnets and the splits of the other quarnets can practically be inferred with high accuracy from nucleotide sequence data. Our algorithm uses only this information, assuming the network contains no triangles. Additionally, we provide an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm that reconstructs the blobtree (or tree-of-blobs) of any binary $n$-leaf semi-directed network with unbounded level from $O(n^3)$ splits of its quarnets.</description>

Abstract: We completely determine the asymptotic depth, equivalently, the asymptotic projective dimension of a chain of edge ideals that is invariant under the action of the monoid Inc of increasing functions on the positive integers. Our results and their proofs also reveal surprising combinatorial and topological properties of corresponding graphs and their independence complexes. In particular, we are able to determine the asymptotic behavior of all reduced homology groups of these independence complexes.</description>

      <title>A computational approach to the study of finite-complement submonids of an affine cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathbb{N}^p$ be an integer cone. A $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S\subseteq \mathcal{C}$ is an affine semigroup such that the set $\mathcal{C}\setminus S$ is finite. Such $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups are central to our study. We develop new algorithms for computing $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups with specified invariants, including genus, Frobenius element, and their combinations, among other invariants. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups, termed $\mathcal{B}$-semigroups. By fixing the degree lexicographic order, we also research the embedding dimension for both ordinary and mult-embedded $\mathbb{N}^2$-semigroups. These results are applied to test some generalizations of Wilf's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Borel Order Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a notion of Borel order dimension for Borel quasi orders. It will be shown that this notion is closely related to the notion of Borel dichromatic number for simple directed graphs. We prove a dichotomy, which generalizes the ${\GGG}_{0}$-dichotomy, for the Borel dichromatic number of Borel simple directed graphs. By applying this dichotomy to Borel quasi orders, another dichotomy that characterizes the Borel quasi orders of uncountable Borel dimension is proved. We obtain further structural information about the Borel quasi orders of countable Borel dimension by showing that they are all Borel linearizable. We then investigate the locally countable Borel quasi orders in more detail, paying special attention to the Turing degrees, and produce models of set theory where the continuum is arbitrarily large and all locally countable Borel quasi orders are of Borel dimension less than the continuum. Combining our results here with earlier work shows that the Borel order dimension of the Turing degrees is usually strictly larger than its classical order dimension.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{A'_n\}$ be the Ap\'ery numbers given by $A'_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{n+k}k.$ For any prime $p\equiv 3\pmod 4$ we show that $A'_{\frac{p-1}2}\equiv \frac{p^2}3\binom{\frac{p-3}2}{\frac{p-3}4}^{-2}\pmod {p^3}$. Let $\{t_n\}$ be given by $$t_0=1,\ t_1=5\quad\hbox{and}\quad t_{n+1}=(8n^2+12n+5)t_n-4n^2(2n+1)^2t_{n-1}\ (n\ge 1).$$ We also obtain the congruences for $t_p\pmod {p^3},\ t_{p-1}\pmod {p^2}$ and $t_{\frac{p-1}2}\pmod {p^2}$, where $p$ is an odd prime.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between notions of additive and multiplicative largeness and its combinatorial applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:1610.09771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many natural notions of additive and multiplicative largeness arise from results in Ramsey theory. In this paper, we explain the relationships between these notions for subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and in more general ring-theoretic structures. We show that multiplicative largeness begets additive largeness in three ways and give a collection of examples demonstrating the optimality of these results. We also give a variety of applications arising from the connection between additive and multiplicative largeness. For example, we show that given any $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$, any finite set with fewer than $n$ elements in a sufficiently large finite field can be translated so that each of its elements becomes a non-zero $k^{\text{th}}$ power. We also prove a theorem concerning Diophantine approximation along multiplicatively syndetic subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and a theorem showing that subsets of positive upper Banach density in certain multiplicative sub-semigroups of $\mathbb{N}$ of zero density contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Along the way, we develop a new characterization of upper Banach density in a wide class of amenable semigroups and make explicit the uniformity in recurrence theorems from measure theoretic and topological dynamics. This in turn leads to strengthened forms of classical theorems of Szemer\'edi and van der Waerden on arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for integer linear programs defined by integer coefficient matrices whose subdeterminants are bounded by a constant and that contain at most two nonzero entries in each row. The core of our approach is the first polynomial-time algorithm for the weighted stable set problem on graphs that do not contain more than $k$ vertex-disjoint odd cycles, where $k$ is any constant. Previously, polynomial-time algorithms were only known for $k=0$ (bipartite graphs) and for $k=1$.
  We observe that integer linear programs defined by coefficient matrices with bounded subdeterminants and two nonzeros per column can be also solved in strongly polynomial-time, using a reduction to $b$-matching.</description>

      <title>Topology of matching complexes of complete graphs via discrete Morse theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bouc first studied the topological properties of the matching complex of the complete graph of order $n$, denoted by $M_n$, in connection with Brown complexes and Quillen complexes. Later Bj\"{o}rner et al. showed that $M_n$ is homotopically $(\nu_n-1)$-connected, where $\nu_n=\lfloor{\frac{n+1}{3}}\rfloor-1$, and conjectured that this connectivity bound is sharp. Shareshian and Wachs settled the conjecture by inductively showing that the $\nu_n$-dimensional homology group of $M_n$ is nontrivial, with Bouc's calculation $H_1(M_7)$ serving as the pivotal base step. In general, the topology of $M_n$ is not very well-understood, even for a small $n$. In the present article, we look into the topology of $M_n$, and $M_7$ in particular, in the light of discrete Morse theory as developed by Forman. We first construct a gradient vector field on $M_n$ (for $n \ge 5$) that doesn't admit any critical simplices of dimension up to $\nu_n-1$, except one unavoidable $0$-simplex, which also leads to the aforementioned $(\nu_n-1)$-connectedness of $M_n$ in a purely combinatorial way. However, for an efficient homology computation by discrete Morse theoretic techniques, we are required to work with a gradient vector field that admits a low number of critical simplices, and also allows an efficient enumeration of gradient paths. An optimal gradient vector field is one with the least number of critical simplices, but the problem of finding an optimal gradient vector field, in general, is an NP-hard problem (even for $2$-dimensional complexes). We improve the gradient vector field constructed on $M_7$ in particular to a much more efficient (near-optimal) one, and then with the help of this improved gradient vector field, compute the homology groups of $M_7$ in an efficient and algorithmic manner. We also augment this near-optimal gradient vector field to one that we conjecture to be optimal.</description>

Abstract: S. Negami conjectured in $1988$ that a connected graph has a finite planar cover if and only if it embeds in the projective plane. It follows from the works of D. Archdeacon, M. Fellows, P. Hlin\v{e}n\'{y}, and S. Negami that this conjecture is true if the graph $K_{1, 2, 2, 2}$ has no finite planar cover. We prove a number of structural results about putative finite planar covers of $K_{1,2,2,2}$ that may be of independent interest. We then apply these results to prove that $K_{1, 2, 2, 2}$ has no planar cover of fold number less than $14$.</description>

      <title>Zig-zag Eulerian polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07181v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any finite partially ordered set $P$, the $P$-Eulerian polynomial is the generating function for the descent number over the set of linear extensions of $P$, and is closely related to the order polynomial of $P$ arising in the theory of $P$-partitions. Here we study the $P$-Eulerian polynomial where $P$ is a naturally labeled zig-zag poset; we call these zig-zag Eulerian polynomials. A result of Br\"and\'en implies that these polynomials are gamma-nonnegative, and hence their coefficients are symmetric and unimodal. The zig-zag Eulerian polynomials and the associated order polynomials have appeared fleetingly in the literature in a wide variety of contexts$\unicode{x2014}$e.g., in the study of polytopes, magic labelings of graphs, and Kekul\'e structures$\unicode{x2014}$but they do not appear to have been studied systematically.
  In this paper, we use a "relaxed" version of $P$-partitions to both survey and unify results. Our technique shows that the zig-zag Eulerian polynomials also capture the distribution of "big returns" over the set of (up-down) alternating permutations, as first observed by Coons and Sullivant. We develop recurrences for refined versions of the relevant generating functions, which evoke similarities to recurrences for the classical Eulerian polynomials. We conclude with a literature survey and open questions.</description>

Abstract: In their study of the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs, Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan introduced a class of branching processes parametrized by a possibly unbounded graphon. We prove that two such branching processes have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic, a notion introduced by Greb\'ik and Rocha.
  A different class of branching processes was introduced by Hladk\'y, Nachmias, and Tran in relation to uniform spanning trees in finite graphs approximating a given connected graphon. We prove that two such branching processes have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic up to scalar multiple. Combined with a recent result of Archer and Shalev, this implies that if uniform spanning trees of two dense graphs have a similar local structure, they have a similar scaling limit.
  As a side result we give a characterization of fractional isomorphism for graphs as well as graphons in terms of their connected components.</description>

Abstract: We call a tree $T$ is \emph{even} if every pair of its leaves is joined by a path of even length. Jackson and Yoshimoto~[J. Graph Theory, 2024] conjectured that every $r$-regular nonbipartite connected graph $G$ has a spanning even tree. They verified this conjecture for the case when $G$ has a $2$-factor. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture holds when $r$ is odd, thereby resolving the only remaining unsolved case for this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Tournament transitivity of graphs</title>

Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say $A$ \textit{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$ in $G$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{tournament transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$ and $V_j$ does not dominate $V_i$ for $i&lt;j$. The maximum integer $k$ for which the above partition exists is called \emph{tournament transitivity} of $G$, and it is denoted by $TTr(G)$. The \textsc{Maximum Tournament Transitivity Problem} is to find a tournament transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. In this article, we study this variation of transitive partition from a structure and algorithmic point of view. We show that the decision version of this problem is NP-complete for chordal graphs (connected), perfect elimination bipartite graphs (disconnected) and doubly chordal graphs (disconnected). On the positive side, we prove that this problem can be solved in polynomial time for trees. Furthermore, we characterize \textup{Type-I BCG} with equal transitivity and tournament transitivity and find some sufficient conditions under which the above two parameters are equal for a \textup{Type-II BCG}. Finally, we show that for \textup{Type-III BCG}, these two parameters are never equal.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous approximation in nilsystems and the multiplicative thickness of return-time sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the topological dynamical system $(X,T)$, a point $x$ simultaneously approximates a point $y$ if there exists a sequence $n_1$, $n_2$, ... of natural numbers for which $T^{n_i} x$, $T^{2n_i}x$, ..., $T^{k n_i} x$ all tend to $y$. In 1978, Furstenberg and Weiss showed that every system possesses a point which simultaneously approximates itself (a multiply recurrent point) and deduced refinements of van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions. In this paper, we study the denseness of the set of points that are simultaneously approximated by a given point. We show that in a minimal nilsystem, all points simultaneously approximate a $\delta$-dense set of points under a necessarily restricted set of powers of $T$. We tie this theorem to the multiplicative combinatorial properties of return-time sets, showing that all nil-Bohr sets and typical return-time sets in a minimal system are multiplicatively thick in a coset of a multiplicative subsemigroup of the natural numbers. This yields an inhomogeneous multiple recurrence result that generalizes Furstenberg and Weiss' theorem and leads to new enhancements of van der Waerden's theorem. This work relies crucially on continuity in the prolongation relation (the closure of the orbit-closure relation) developed by Auslander, Akin, and Glasner; the theory of rational points and polynomials on nilmanifolds developed by Leibman, Green, and Tao; and the machinery of topological characteristic factors developed recently by Glasner, Huang, Shao, Weiss, and Ye.</description>

      <title>Structured Decompositions: Structural and Algorithmic Compositionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06091v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce structured decompositions. These are category-theoretic data structures which simlutaneously generalize notions from graph theory (including tree-width, layered tree-width, co-tree-width and graph decomposition width) geometric group theory (specifically Bass-Serre theory) and dynamical systems (e.g. hybrid dynamical systems). Furthermore, structured decompositions allow us to generalize these aforementioned combinatorial invariants, which have played a central role in the study of structural and algorithmic compositionality in both graph theory and parameterized complexity, to new settings. For example, in any category with enough colimits they describe algorithmically useful structural compositionality: as an application of our theory we prove an algorithmic meta-theorem for the Sub_P-composition problem. In concrete terms, when instantiated in the category of graphs, this meta-theorem yields compositional algorithms for NP-hard problems such as: Maximum Bipartite Subgraph, Maximum Planar Subgraph and Longest Path.</description>

      <title>Representing Carlitz formula with q-shift operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new formula for the q-shift operator, building on the techniques by Liu and Sears. This formula provides fresh proof of the Carlitz formula and extends it naturally. As applications, we derive an equivalent form of the generalized Carlitz formula to prove two $q$-congruences on cyclotomic polynomials, which expand upon the results of Guo et al.</description>
