      <title>The May 2024 Storm: dayside magnetopause and cusps in simulated soft X-Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronal mass ejection (CME) arriving at Earth on May 10, 2024 caused the most intense geomagnetic storm in the last two decades, and resulted in highly unusual magnetopause and cusp dynamics. We simulate soft X-Ray emission due to solar wind charge exchange with exospheric neutrals to image the global dayside dynamics, focusing on the impact of a dense CME current sheet during the storm main phase. The magnetopause moves inward to ~ 4 RE, and at the same time, the two cusps manifest as nearly parallel emission ridges in X-Ray. As the interplanetary magnetic field reverses, the cusp ridges move to higher latitudes for ~ 10 minutes after the reversal. The X-Ray emission can be detected by imagers to be flown on future missions to provide a global picture of the magnetopause and cusps with quantitative determination of their locations</description>

      <title>Accounting for Solar Radiation Pressure in the Hamiltonian Normal Form of the Elliptic Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian normal forms allow for the analytical approximation of center manifold trajectories and their invariant manifolds through the separation of the saddle and center subspaces that make up the dynamics at the collinear libration points within the elliptic restricted three-body problem. The circular restricted three-body problem is a special case of the elliptic problem-- one that does not take into account the eccentricity of the true orbits of the primaries and thus provides a dynamical model of varying accuracy depending on the true anomaly of the primaries. This paper first shows that the normal forms of the elliptic problem offer nearly identical trajectory characterization capabilities to those of the circular problem and then demonstrates the difference in fidelity by comparing the circular and elliptic normal form representations of ephemeris data for the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, methodology for including solar radiation pressure within the normal form is introduced, and the same ephemeris data is used to demonstrate the resulting increase in fidelity of the dynamical model.</description>

      <title>Enhanced slow magnetic-Coriolis waves with magnetic field orthogonal to rotation axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfv\'en velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfv\'en waves. The timescales on which Alfv\'en waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfv\'en waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfv\'en waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</description>

      <title>Understanding cold electron impact on parallel-propagating whistler chorus waves via moment-based quasilinear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's magnetosphere hosts a wide range of collisionless particle populations that interact through various wave-particle processes. Among these, cold electrons, with energies below 100eV, often dominate the plasma density but remain poorly characterized due to measurement challenges such as spacecraft charging and photoelectron contamination. Understanding the contribution of these cold populations to wave-particle interaction is of significant interest. Recent kinetic simulations identified a secondary drift-driven instability in which parallel-propagating whistler-mode chorus waves excite oblique electrostatic whistler waves near the resonance cone and Bernstein-mode turbulence. These secondary modes enable a new channel of energy transfer from the parallel-propagating whistler wave to the cold electrons. In this work, we develop a moment-based quasilinear theory of the secondary instabilities to quantify such energy exchange. Our results show that these secondary instabilities persist for a wide range of parameters and, in many cases, lead to nearly complete damping of the primary wave. Such secondary instability might limit the amplitude of parallel-propagating whistler waves in Earth's magnetosphere and might explain why high-amplitude oblique whistler or electron Bernstein waves are rarely observed simultaneously with high-amplitude field-aligned whistler waves in the inner magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear theory of perpendicular ion heating by critically balanced turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In collisionless astrophysical plasmas, turbulence mediates the partitioning of free energy among cascade channels and its dissipation into ion and electron heat. The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfv\'enic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfv\'enic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Teaching Using Immersion - Explaining Magnetism and Eclipses in a Planetarium Dome</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously we have shown that three-dimensional concepts are more readily learned in a three-dimensional context. Although VR headsets are growing in popularity, they only provide a quite limited field of view, and each person in a group may be viewing a different direction or a different time in the visualization. By using instead a fullsphere movie (VR360) in a planetarium dome instead of a headset, you can "share the VR"(TM) and specify which half of the sphere your audience is looking at. You can pause the movie, ask questions using a clicker system, display the results, and move on if the subject is mastered or explain more if items are not understood. This paper shows the results of teaching magnetism in a dome theater, showing that both students and teachers nearly double their understanding of magnetism topics after one viewing. We also created seven animations explaining eclipses that were distributed free to nearly 200 planetariums. Listing of concepts learned by teachers in our live eclipse program are shown.</description>
