      <title>Distribution Regression Difference-In-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a simple distribution regression estimator for treatment effects in the difference-in-differences (DiD) design. Our procedure is particularly useful when the treatment effect differs across the distribution of the outcome variable. Our proposed estimator easily incorporates covariates and, importantly, can be extended to settings where the treatment potentially affects the joint distribution of multiple outcomes. Our key identifying restriction is that the counterfactual distribution of the treated in the untreated state has no interaction effect between treatment and time. This assumption results in a parallel trend assumption on a transformation of the distribution. We highlight the relationship between our procedure and assumptions with the changes-in-changes approach of Athey and Imbens (2006). We also reexamine two existing empirical examples which highlight the utility of our approach.</description>

      <title>The Application of Green GDP and Its Impact on Global Economy and Environment: Analysis of GGDP based on SEEA model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of Green Gross Domestic Product (GGDP) using the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) model to evaluate its impact on global climate mitigation and economic health. GGDP is proposed as a superior measure to tradi-tional GDP by incorporating natural resource consumption, environmental pollution control, and degradation factors. The study develops a GGDP model and employs grey correlation analysis and grey prediction models to assess its relationship with these factors. Key findings demonstrate that replacing GDP with GGDP can positively influence climate change, partic-ularly in reducing CO2 emissions and stabilizing global temperatures. The analysis further explores the implications of GGDP adoption across developed and developing countries, with specific predictions for China and the United States. The results indicate a potential increase in economic levels for developing countries, while developed nations may experi-ence a decrease. Additionally, the shift to GGDP is shown to significantly reduce natural re-source depletion and population growth rates in the United States, suggesting broader envi-ronmental and economic benefits. This paper highlights the universal applicability of the GGDP model and its potential to enhance environmental and economic policies globally.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Data Elements on Narrowing the Urban-Rural Consumption Gap in China: Mechanisms and Policy Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urban-rural consumption gap, as one of the important indicators in social development, directly reflects the imbalance in urban and rural economic and social development. Data elements, as an important component of New Quality Productivity, are of significant importance in promoting economic development and improving people's living standards in the information age. This study, through the analysis of fixed-effects regression models, system GMM regression models, and the intermediate effect model, found that the development level of data elements to some extent promotes the narrowing of the urban-rural consumption gap. At the same time, the intermediate variable of urban-rural income gap plays an important role between data elements and consumption gap, with a significant intermediate effect. The results of the study indicate that the advancement of data elements can promote the balance of urban and rural residents' consumption levels by reducing the urban-rural income gap, providing theoretical support and policy recommendations for achieving common prosperity and promoting coordinated urban-rural development. Building upon this, this paper emphasizes the complex correlation between the development of data elements and the urban-rural consumption gap, and puts forward policy suggestions such as promoting the development of the data element market, strengthening the construction of the digital economy and e-commerce, and promoting integrated urban-rural development. Overall, the development of data elements is not only an important path to reducing the urban-rural consumption gap but also one of the key drivers for promoting the balanced development of China's economic and social development. This study has a certain theoretical and practical significance for understanding the mechanism of the urban-rural consumption gap and improving policies for urban-rural economic development.</description>

      <title>Momentum Dynamics in Competitive Sports: A Multi-Model Analysis Using TOPSIS and Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of "momentum" in sports competitions through the use of the TOPSIS model and 0-1 logistic regression model. First, the TOPSIS model is employed to evaluate the performance of two tennis players, with visualizations used to analyze the situation's evolution at every moment in the match, explaining how "momentum" manifests in sports. Then, the 0-1 logistic regression model is utilized to verify the impact of "momentum" on match outcomes, demonstrating that fluctuations in player performance and the successive occurrence of successes are not random. Additionally, this paper examines the indicators that influence the reversal of game situations by analyzing key match data and testing the accuracy of the models with match data. The findings show that the model accurately explains the conditions during matches and can be generalized to other sports competitions. Finally, the strengths, weaknesses, and potential future improvements of the model are discussed.</description>

      <title>Double Machine Learning at Scale to Predict Causal Impact of Customer Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal Impact (CI) of customer actions are broadly used across the industry to inform both short- and long-term investment decisions of various types. In this paper, we apply the double machine learning (DML) methodology to estimate the CI values across 100s of customer actions of business interest and 100s of millions of customers. We operationalize DML through a causal ML library based on Spark with a flexible, JSON-driven model configuration approach to estimate CI at scale (i.e., across hundred of actions and millions of customers). We outline the DML methodology and implementation, and associated benefits over the traditional potential outcomes based CI model. We show population-level as well as customer-level CI values along with confidence intervals. The validation metrics show a 2.2% gain over the baseline methods and a 2.5X gain in the computational time. Our contribution is to advance the scalable application of CI, while also providing an interface that allows faster experimentation, cross-platform support, ability to onboard new use cases, and improves accessibility of underlying code for partner teams.</description>

      <title>Fitting an Equation to Data Impartially</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a relationship (e.g. a potential scientific law) to data involving multiple variables. Ordinary (least squares) regression is not suitable for this because the estimated relationship will differ according to which variable is chosen as being dependent, and the dependent variable is unrealistically assumed to be the only variable which has any measurement error (noise). We present a very general method for estimating a linear functional relationship between multiple noisy variables, which are treated impartially, i.e. no distinction between dependent and independent variables. The data are not assumed to follow any distribution, but all variables are treated as being equally reliable. Our approach extends the geometric mean functional relationship to multiple dimensions. This is especially useful with variables measured in different units, as it is naturally scale-invariant, whereas orthogonal regression is not. This is because our approach is not based on minimizing distances, but on the symmetric concept of correlation. The estimated coefficients are easily obtained from the covariances or correlations, and correspond to geometric means of associated least squares coefficients. The ease of calculation will hopefully allow widespread application of impartial fitting to estimate relationships in a neutral way.</description>

      <title>Safe Policy Learning under Regression Discontinuity Designs with Multiple Cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13323v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regression discontinuity (RD) design is widely used for program evaluation with observational data. The primary focus of the existing literature has been the estimation of the local average treatment effect at the existing treatment cutoff. In contrast, we consider policy learning under the RD design. Because the treatment assignment mechanism is deterministic, learning better treatment cutoffs requires extrapolation. We develop a robust optimization approach to finding optimal treatment cutoffs that improve upon the existing ones. We first decompose the expected utility into point-identifiable and unidentifiable components. We then propose an efficient doubly-robust estimator for the identifiable parts. To account for the unidentifiable components, we leverage the existence of multiple cutoffs that are common under the RD design. Specifically, we assume that the heterogeneity in the conditional expectations of potential outcomes across different groups vary smoothly along the running variable. Under this assumption, we minimize the worst case utility loss relative to the status quo policy. The resulting new treatment cutoffs have a safety guarantee that they will not yield a worse overall outcome than the existing cutoffs. Finally, we establish the asymptotic regret bounds for the learned policy using semi-parametric efficiency theory. We apply the proposed methodology to empirical and simulated data sets.</description>

      <title>Weighted Regression with Sybil Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many online domains, Sybil networks -- or cases where a single user assumes multiple identities -- is a pervasive feature. This complicates experiments, as off-the-shelf regression estimators at least assume known network topologies (if not fully independent observations) when Sybil network topologies in practice are often unknown. The literature has exclusively focused on techniques to detect Sybil networks, leading many experimenters to subsequently exclude suspected networks entirely before estimating treatment effects. I present a more efficient solution in the presence of these suspected Sybil networks: a weighted regression framework that applies weights based on the probabilities that sets of observations are controlled by single actors. I show in the paper that the MSE-minimizing solution is to set the weight matrix equal to the inverse of the expected network topology. I demonstrate the methodology on simulated data, and then I apply the technique to a competition with suspected Sybil networks run on the Sui blockchain and show reductions in the standard error of the estimate by 6 - 24%.</description>
