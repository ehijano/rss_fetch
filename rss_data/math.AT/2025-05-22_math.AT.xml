      <title>Smooth atlas stratified spaces, K-Homology Orientations, and Gysin maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce smooth atlas stratified spaces. We show that this class is closed under cartesian products; consequently, it is possible to define fiber bundles of smooth atlas stratified spaces. We describe the resolution of such a space to a manifold with fibered corners and use this result in order to prove that the class of smooth atlas stratified spaces coincides with that of Thom-Mather stratified spaces.
  We then consider Witt pseudomanifolds (such as singular complex algebraic varieties) where it is well-known that a bordism invariant signature is available and equal to the Fredholm index of a realization of the signature operator. To each oriented fiber bundle of stratified spaces, with Witt fibers, we assign a class in bivariant KK-theory (with 2 inverted). Kasparov multiplication by this element defines a Gysin map in analytic K-homology and one of our main results is that this Gysin map preserves the analytic signature class of Witt spaces. We prove in fact a more general result: functoriality for fiber bundles in the sense that if one fiber bundle is the composition of two others then the KK-class of the former is the Kasparov product of the classes of the latter. We also discuss this result for other Dirac-type operators satisfying an analytic Witt condition, for example the spin-Dirac operator on a fibration of psc-Witt spin pseudomanifolds. We next define the analytic Gysin map associated to an oriented normally non-singular inclusion of Witt spaces and prove that it also preserves the signature class.
  Finally, we relate the analytic signature class of a Witt space with the topological Siegel-Sullivan orientation. Specifically we show that if one applies the inverse of the second Adams operation to the Sullivan orientation and complexifies then one obtains our analytic signature class under the natural identification between analytic and topological K-homology.</description>

      <title>Limits of $(\infty, 1)$-categories with structure and their lax morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Riehl and Verity have established that for a quasi-category $A$ that admits limits, and a homotopy coherent monad on $A$ which does not preserve limits, the Eilenberg-Moore object still admits limits; this can be interpreted as a completeness result involving lax morphisms. We generalise their result to different models for $(\infty, 1)$-categories, with an abundant variety of structures. For instance, $(\infty, 1)$-categories with limits, Cartesian fibrations between $(\infty, 1)$-categories, and adjunctions between $(\infty, 1)$-categories. In addition, we show that these $(\infty, 1)$-categories with structure in fact possess an important class of limits of lax morphisms, including $\infty$-categorical versions of inserters and equifiers, when only one morphism in the diagram is required to be structure-preserving. Our approach provides a minimal requirement and a transparent explanation for several kinds of limits of $(\infty, 1)$-categories and their lax morphisms to exist.</description>

      <title>Localising invariants in derived bornological geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study several categories of analytic stacks relative to the category of bornological modules over a Banach ring. When the underlying Banach ring is a nonarchimedean valued field, this category contains derived rigid analytic spaces as a full subcategory. When the underlying field is the complex numbers, it contains the category of derived complex analytic spaces. In the second part of the paper, we consider localising invariants of rigid categories associated to bornological algebras. The main results in this part include Nisnevich descent for derived analytic spaces and a version of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch Theorem for derived dagger analytic spaces over an arbitrary Banach ring.</description>

      <title>Cohen's theorem in tensor triangular geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Cohen from 1950 states that a commutative ring is Noetherian if and only if every prime ideal is finitely generated. In this note, we establish analogues of this result in tensor triangular geometry. In particular, for an essentially small tensor triangulated category $\mathscr{K}$ with weakly Noetherian spectrum, we show that every prime ideal in $\mathscr{K}$ can be generated by finitely many objects if and only if the set of prime ideals of $\mathscr{K}$ is finite.</description>

      <title>On $H^*(BPU_n; \mathbb{Z})$ and Weyl group invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the projective unitary group $PU_n$ with a maximal torus $T_{PU_n}$ and Weyl group $W$, we show that the integral restriction homomorphism
  \[\rho_{PU_n} \colon H^*(BPU_n;\mathbb{Z})\rightarrow H^*(BT_{PU_n};\mathbb{Z})^W\]
  to the integral invariants of the Weyl group action is onto. We also present several rings naturally isomorphic to $H^*(BT_{PU_n};\mathbb{Z})^W$.
  In addition we give general sufficient conditions for the restriction homomorphism $\rho_G$ to be onto for a connected compact Lie group $G$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial functors from free groups to a stable infinity-category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the category of polynomial functors from finitely generated free groups to a stable infinity-category D. We show that this category is equivalent to the category of excisive functors from pointed animas to D, and also to truncated right comodules over the commutative operad with values in D. The latter formulation generalizes a result of Geoffrey Powell in characteristic zero.
  We use the equivalence of categories to calculate Ext between polynomial functors from free groups to abelian groups, extending previous results of Christine Vespa and others. Using the work of Aurelien Djament, we give applications to stable cohomology of automorphism groups of free groups with coefficients in a polynomial functor.</description>

      <title>Differential topology of the spaces of asymptotically stable vector fields and Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of all smooth asymptotically stable vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^n$, as well as the space of all proper smooth Lyapunov functions for such vector fields. We prove that both spaces are path-connected and simply connected when $n\neq 4,5$ and weakly contractible when $n\leq 3$. Moreover, both spaces have the weak homotopy type of the nonlinear Grassmannian of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ diffeomorphic to the $n$-disc.
  The proofs rely on Lyapunov theory and differential topology, such as the work of Smale and Perelman on the generalized Poincar\'{e} conjecture and results of Smale, Cerf, and Hatcher on the topology of diffeomorphism groups of discs. Applications include a partial answer to a question of Conley, a parametric Hartman-Grobman theorem for nonyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria, and a parametric Morse lemma for degenerate minima. We also study the related topics of hyperbolic equilibria, Morse minima, and relative homotopy groups of the space of asymptotically stable vector fields inside the space of those vanishing at a single point.</description>
