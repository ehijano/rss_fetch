      <title>Light intensity does not always decay with the inverse of the square of the distance: an open-inquiry laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square inverse law with distance plays an important role in many fields of physics covering electromagnetism, optics or acoustics. However, as every law in physics has its range of validity. We propose an open-inquiry laboratory where we challenge these concepts by proposing experiments where the intensity of light decays linearly or even remains constant over a range of distances. Using the light sensors built into smartphones, it is possible to measure light curves for different sources: point, linear, planar and even LED ring lights. The analysis of these curves allows us to discuss the limits of the physical theories. This low-cost laboratory, initially proposed in the context of the COVID19 pandemic, has the virtue of challenging intuition and encouraging the critical spirit of the students.</description>

      <title>Science of a coffee cup: a physicist walks into a bar...</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ... and annoys everyone with unsolicited experiments. The present paper proposes a short pedagogical review of the various phenomena that can be observed in a coffee cup with little to no equipment. The physical domains spanned include acoustics, optics and, of course, fluid mechanics. The variety of experimental and theoretical techniques introduced throughout the paper makes it suitable for a broad audience. For each topic, we first propose an experimental realization before introducing a minimal model to explain the observations. We end each section by discussing more advanced works existing in the literature as well as related applications. We provide detailed experimental procedures and videos of the experiments that can be freely used for teaching purposes. The phenomena presented here also show remarkable efficiency as icebreakers for morning coffee in laboratories or conferences.</description>

      <title>Unified approach to the electromagnetic field: the role of the sources, causality and wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13479v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thoughtless treatment of Maxwell's equations can lead to the interpretation of the existence of a causal relationship between their different terms and, therefore, that an electric field that varies in time generates a magnetic one and vice versa. In this article we address the problems associated with these interpretations and their consequences for the teaching of physics in introductory university physics courses. First, we develop the main arguments that support that charge and current densities, constant or variable in time, are the generators of electric and magnetic fields. Then, we propose a number of classroom examples at the level of introductory courses that allow us to discuss the reasons why considering the electric and magnetic fields as disjoint entities leads to contradictions. Finally, we analyze their implications in introductory physics teaching.</description>
