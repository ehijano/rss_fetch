      <title>Joint Motion, Angle, and Range Estimation in Near-Field under Array Calibration Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output MIMO (UM-MIMO) leverages large antenna arrays at high frequencies, transitioning communication paradigm into the radiative near-field (NF), where spherical wavefronts enable full-vector estimation of both target location and velocity. However, location and motion parameters become inherently coupled in this regime, making their joint estimation computationally demanding. To overcome this, we propose a novel approach that projects the received two-dimensional space-time signal onto the angle-Doppler domain using a two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (2D-DFT). Our analysis reveals that the resulting angular spread is centered at the target's true angle, with its width determined by the target's range. Similarly, transverse motion induces a Doppler spread centered at the true radial velocity, with the width of Doppler spread proportional to the transverse velocity. Exploiting these spectral characteristics, we develop a low-complexity algorithm that provides coarse estimates of angle, range, and velocity, which are subsequently refined using one-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC) applied independently to each parameter. The proposed method enables accurate and efficient estimation of NF target motion parameters. Simulation results demonstrate a normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of -40 dB for location and velocity estimates compared to maximum likelihood estimation, while significantly reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Space Shift Keying-Enabled ISAC for Efficient Debris Detection and Communication in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of space debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) presents critical challenges for orbital safety, particularly for satellite constellations. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide a promising dual function solution by enabling both environmental sensing and data communication. This study explores the use of space shift keying (SSK) modulation within ISAC frameworks, evaluating its performance when combined with sinusoidal and chirp radar waveforms. SSK is particularly attractive due to its low hardware complexity and robust communication performance. Our results demonstrate that both waveforms achieve comparable bit error rate (BER) performance under SSK, validating its effectiveness for ISAC applications. However, waveform selection significantly affects sensing capability: while the sinusoidal waveform supports simpler implementation, its high ambiguity limits range detection. In contrast, the chirp waveform enables range estimation and provides a modest improvement in velocity detection accuracy. These findings highlight the strength of SSK as a modulation scheme for ISAC and emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate waveforms to optimize sensing accuracy without compromising communication performance. This insight supports the design of efficient and scalable ISAC systems for space applications, particularly in the context of orbital debris monitoring.</description>

      <title>Sensing and Stopping Interfering Secondary Users: Validation of an Efficient Spectrum Sharing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and validation of Stoppable Secondary Use (StopSec), a privacy-preserving protocol with the capability to identify a secondary user (SU) causing interference to a primary user (PU) and to act quickly to stop the interference. All users are served by a database that provides a feedback mechanism from a PU to an interfering SU. We introduce a new lightweight and robust method to watermark an SU's OFDM packet. Through extensive over-the-air real-time experiments, we evaluate StopSec in terms of interference detection, identification, and stopping latency, as well as impact on SUs. We show that the watermarking method avoids negative impact to the secondary data link and is robust to real-world time-varying channels. Interfering SUs can be stopped in under 150 milliseconds, and when multiple users are simultaneously interfering, they can all be stopped. Even when the interference is 10 dB lower than the noise power, StopSec successfully stops interfering SUs within a few seconds of their appearance in the channel. StopSec can be an effective spectrum sharing protocol for cases when interference to a PU must be quickly and automatically stopped.</description>

      <title>Towards channel foundation models (CFMs): Motivations, methodologies and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, conventional AI-based models encounter several limitations, such as heavy reliance on labeled data, limited generalization capability, and task-specific design. To address these challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and the combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early stage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on model architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse channel datasets.</description>

      <title>ISAC: From Human to Environmental Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is poised to become one of the defining capabilities of the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications systems, enabling the network infrastructure to jointly support high-throughput communications and situational awareness. While recent advances have explored ISAC for both human-centric applications and environmental monitoring, existing research remains fragmented across these domains. This paper provides the first unified review of ISAC-enabled sensing for both human activities and environment, focusing on signal-level mechanisms, sensing features, and real-world feasibility. We begin by characterising how diverse physical phenomena, ranging from human vital sign and motion to precipitation and flood dynamics, impact wireless signal propagation, producing measurable signatures in channel state information (CSI), Doppler profiles, and signal statistics. A comprehensive analysis is then presented across two domains: human sensing applications including localisation, activity recognition, and vital sign monitoring; and environmental sensing for rainfall, soil moisture, and water level. Experimental results from Long-Term Evolution (LTE) sensing under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions are incorporated to highlight the feasibility in infrastructure-limited scenarios. Open challenges in signal fusion, domain adaptation, and generalisable sensing architectures are discussed to facilitate future research toward scalable and autonomous ISAC.</description>

      <title>Simulation for Noncontact Radar-Based Physiological Sensing Using Depth-Camera-Derived Human 3D Model with Electromagnetic Scattering Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a method for simulating signals received by frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar during respiratory monitoring, using human body geometry and displacement data acquired via a depth camera. Unlike previous studies that rely on simplified models of body geometry or displacement, the proposed approach models high-frequency scattering centers based on realistic depth-camera-measured body shapes and motions. Experiments were conducted with six participants under varying conditions, including varying target distances, seating orientations, and radar types, with simultaneous acquisition from the radar and depth camera. Relative to conventional model-based methods, the proposed technique achieved improvements of 7.5%, 58.2%, and 3.2% in the correlation coefficients of radar images, displacements, and spectrograms, respectively. This work contributes to the generation of radar-based physiological datasets through simulation and enhances our understanding of factors affecting the accuracy of non-contact sensing.</description>

      <title>On two fundamental properties of the zeros of spectrograms of noisy signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of the zeros of the spectrogram is significantly altered when a signal is added to white Gaussian noise. The zeros tend to delineate the support of the signal, and deterministic structures form in the presence of interference, as if the zeros were trapped. While sophisticated methods have been proposed to detect signals as holes in the pattern of spectrogram zeros, few formal arguments have been made to support the delineation and trapping effects. Through detailed computations for simple toy signals, we show that two basic mathematical arguments, the intensity of zeros and Rouch\'e's theorem, allow discussing delineation and trapping, and the influence of parameters like the signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, interfering chirps, even nearly superimposed, yield an easy-to-detect deterministic structure among zeros.</description>

      <title>Device-Free Localization Using Commercial UWB Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers have enabled not only measuring device-to-device distance but also tracking the position of a pedestrian who does not carry a UWB device. UWB-based device-free localization that does not require dedicated radar equipment is compatible with existing anchor infrastructure and can be reused to reduce hardware deployment costs. However, it is difficult to estimate the target's position accurately in real-world scenarios due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the cluttered environment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-assisted particle filter to overcome these challenges. First, the channel impulse response (CIR) variance is analyzed to capture the variability induced by the target's movement. Then, a DL-based one-dimensional attention U-Net is used to extract only the reflection components caused by the target and suppress the noise components within the CIR variance profile. Finally, multiple preprocessed CIR variance profiles are used as input to a particle filter to estimate the target's position. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is a practical and cost-effective solution for IoT and automotive applications with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 15 cm and an average processing time of 4 ms. Furthermore, comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed method provides the best performance with reasonable computational costs.</description>

      <title>Distortion-Aware Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a practical partially-connected hybrid beamforming transmitter for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with distortion from nonlinear power amplification. For this ISAC system, we formulate a communication rate and sensing mutual information maximization problem driven by our distortion-aware hybrid beamforming design. To address this non-convex problem, we first solve for a fully digital beamforming matrix by alternatively solving three sub-problems using manifold optimization (MO) and our derived closed-form solutions. The analog and digital beamforming matrices are then obtained through a decomposition algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve overall ISAC performance compared to traditional beamforming methods.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical Fluid Antenna Systems: Co-Optimizing Hardware and Software for Port Selection and Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hardware-software co-design approach to efficiently optimize beamforming and port selection in fluid antenna systems (FASs). To begin with, a fluid-antenna (FA)-enabled downlink multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network is modeled, and a weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated. Second, a method that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with random port selection (RPS) is proposed to jointly optimize beamforming and port selection, while also assessing the benefits and limitations of random selection. Third, an instruction-driven deep learning accelerator based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is developed to minimize inference latency. To further enhance efficiency, a scheduling algorithm is introduced to reduce redundant computations and minimize the idle time of computing cores. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GNN-RPS approach achieves competitive communication performance. Furthermore, experimental evaluations indicate that the FPGA-based accelerator maintains low latency while simultaneously executing beamforming inference for multiple port selections.</description>

      <title>Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Environmental Monitoring, and Newtonian Noise Mitigation:Comparable Sensitivity to Seismometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Newtonian noise limits the low-frequency sensitivity of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. While seismometers and geophones are commonly employed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their limited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this study, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and scalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional seismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated seismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong correlation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz frequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed acoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation remains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing accurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As a case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise recorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results with those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed acoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor of 0.11 at 20 Hz. These findings confirm the feasibility of using distributed acoustic sensing for Newtonian noise mitigation and highlight its potential, in combination with traditional seismic sensors, to improve environmental monitoring and noise suppression in current and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>CARTS: Cooperative and Adaptive Resource Triggering and Stitching for 5G ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents CARTS, an adaptive 5G uplink sensing scheme designed to provide Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) services. The performance of both communication and sensing fundamentally depends on the availability of accurate and up-to-date channel state information (CSI). In modern 5G networks, uplink CSI is derived from two reference signals: the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS). However, current base station implementations treat these CSI measurements as separate information streams. The key innovation of CARTS is to fuse these two CSI streams, thereby increasing the frequency of CSI updates and extending sensing opportunities to more users. CARTS addresses two key challenges: (i) a novel channel stitching and compensation method that integrates asynchronous CSI estimates from DMRS and SRS, despite their different time and frequency allocations, and (ii) a real-time SRS triggering algorithm that complements the inherently uncontrollable DMRS schedule, ensuring sufficient and non-redundant sensing opportunities for all users. Our trace-driven evaluation shows that CARTS significantly improves scalability, achieving a channel estimation error (NMSE) of 0.167 and UE tracking accuracy of 85 cm while supporting twice the number of users as a periodic SRS-only baseline with similar performance. By opportunistically combining DMRS and SRS, CARTS therefore provides a practical, standard-compliant solution to improve CSI availability for ISAC without requiring additional radio resources.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Distortion Equalization in Multi-Span Optical Links Via a Feed-Forward Photonic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear and nonlinear distortions in optical communication signals are equalized using an integrated feed-forward Photonic Neural Network (PNN). The PNN is based on a linear stage made of an 8-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, featuring tunable amplitude and phase weights at each tap, and of a nonlinear stage achieved through the square modulus operation at the end-of-line photodetector. Within an Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection (IMDD) system, the PNN is applied to 2-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM2) optical signals undergoing multi-span propagation. Each 50 km segment includes fiber transmission, optical power restoration, and optional chromatic dispersion compensation via a Tunable Dispersion Compensator. Positioned at the receiver, the PNN enables fully optical signal processing with minimal latency and power consumption. Experimental validation is conducted using a Silicon-On-Insulator device operating on 10 Gbps signals. It demonstrates chromatic dispersion equalization over distances up to 200 km and self-phase modulation (with dispersion removed) up to 450 km. Simulations explore PNN adaptation for 100 Gbps modulations and its potential for cross-phase modulation equalization.</description>

      <title>On the Trade-Off Between Sum-Rate and Energy Efficiency through the Convergence of HAPS and Active RIS Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13889</link>

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) relay with high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) to enhance non-terrestrial network (NTN) performance in next-generation wireless systems. While prior studies focused on passive RIS architectures, the severe path loss and double fading in long-distance HAPS links make active RIS a more suitable alternative due to its inherent signal amplification capabilities. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem to jointly optimize power allocation and RIS element assignment for ground user equipments (UEs) supported by a HAPS-based active RIS-assisted communication system. To reduce power consumption and hardware complexity, several sub-connected active RIS architectures are also explored. Simulation results reveal that active RIS configurations significantly outperform passive RIS in terms of quality of service (QoS). Moreover, although fully-connected architectures achieve the highest throughput, sub-connected schemes demonstrate superior energy efficiency under practical power constraints. These findings highlight the potential of active RIS-enabled HAPS systems to meet the growing demands of beyond-cellular coverage and green networking.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Integration of Quantum Cascade Lasers with Germanium-on-Silicon waveguides for Mid-Infrared Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel scheme for hybrid integration of quantum cascade laser bars with germanium-on-silicon waveguides operating in the mid-infrared. The laser bars are flip-chip bonded onto a germanium-on-silicon target chip without active alignment, acheiving end-fire coupling efficiency of up to 45% (3.5 dB loss) in pulsed operation. Optical power estimates indicate 20-30 mW coupled into the waveguides. The passive alignment approach, combined with a CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuit fabrication process, offers a scalable pathway to fully integrated mid-infrared photonic systems for sensing, free-space communications, and the realisation of novel light sources.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial-Driven Experimental Study on Deep Learning for RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence thresholds.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Design and Prototype Validation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Sensing Surface: Forward-Only Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23883v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted communication schemes have recently garnered significant research attention. In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.</description>

      <title>Memory-less and Backscatter-less Tunnel Diode Harmonic Signatures for RFID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunnel diodes have traditionally been researched for extending backscatter read-ranges for ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags as reflection amplifiers. This paper explores the natural harmonics that arise from biasing these diodes within their negative differential resistance regions and with no interrogating signal from a transmitting source, such as an RFID reader, to injection-lock these diodes. These harmonics are characterized for five tunnel diode boards, made with the same components and with each board's fundamental frequencies measuring at above -15 dBm at a biasing voltage of 200 mV when measured over-the-cable. The occurrence of these harmonics creates unique harmonic signatures for each board and demonstrates possible harmonic RFID applications that can help RFID readers discover and even identify RFID tags with backscatter-less and memory-less IDs generated by tunnel diodes.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS with Spread Carrier Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation is a communication framework that parameterizes the wireless channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the parameters map directly to physical attributes of the scatterers that comprise the scattering environment. As a consequence, the channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is a pulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train modulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is localized rather than spread, and it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We describe how to transform the orthonormal basis of Zak-OTFS pulsones into an orthonormal basis of spread carrier waveforms with low PAPR (only $6.58$ dB) that support communication in the presence of mobility and delay spread. This transformation is realized by a unitary transform based on the discrete affine Fourier transform. Unlike other spread modulations that achieve low PAPR by spreading information across a wider bandwidth (thus reducing the spectral efficiency), the proposed spread carrier-based Zak-OTFS achieves full spectral efficiency like pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, with $5.6$ dB lower PAPR per basis element. We demonstrate uncoded bit error rate (BER) similar to pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, and improved BER performance over competing methods based on OFDM and OTFS in high mobility &amp; delay spread environments.</description>

      <title>Precoded Zak-OTFS for Per-Carrier Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. The image of the scattering environment changes slowly, making it possible to employ precoding at the transmitter. Precoding techniques were developed more than thirty years ago for wireline modem channels (V.34 standard) defined by linear convolution where a pulse in the time domain (TD) is used to probe the one-dimensional partial response channel. The action of a doubly spread channel on Zak-OTFS modulation determines a two-dimensional partial response channel defined by twisted convolution, and we develop a novel precoding technique for this channel. The proposed precoder leads to separate equalization of each DD carrier which has significantly lower complexity than joint equalization of all carriers. Further, the effective precoded channel results in non-interfering DD carriers which significantly reduces the overhead of guard carriers separating data and pilot carriers, which improves the spectral efficiency significantly.</description>

      <title>Differential Communication in Channels with Mobility and Delay Spread using Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is carried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is predictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically, albeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication scheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot transmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be used as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data can enable further detection enabling the "differential" aspect of the communication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD channel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data symbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next instant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it allows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would otherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols. Second, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded pilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot scheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Tradeoff for Sensing and Communication in Cell-Free MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal joint beamforming (BF) for joint sensing and communication (JSAC) in small-scale cell-free MIMO (CF-MIMO) systems. While prior works have explored JSAC optimization using methods such as successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR), many of these approaches either lack global optimality or require additional rank-reduction steps. In contrast, we propose an SDR-based optimization framework that guarantees globally optimal solutions without post-processing. To benchmark its performance, we introduce a standalone BF strategy that dedicates each access point (AP) exclusively to either communication or sensing. The proposed formulation builds upon a general multi-user system model, enabling future extensions beyond the single-user setting. Overall, our framework offers a globally optimal and computationally efficient BF design, providing valuable insights for the development of next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Incremental Averaging Method to Improve Graph-Based Time-Difference-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the position of a speech source based on time-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) is often adversely affected by background noise and reverberation. A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a microphone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone pairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of microphone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of microphone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently a more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs by computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT function reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on the TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT functions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral densities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we increase the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs computed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals recorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially distributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations and three reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering multiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation accuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely on a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position estimation.</description>
