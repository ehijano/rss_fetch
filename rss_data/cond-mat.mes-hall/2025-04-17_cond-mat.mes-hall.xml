      <title>Giant Exciton Transport in hBN/2D-Perovskite Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional perovskites, such as Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites, exhibit outstanding optical properties and high exciton binding energies but are highly susceptible to degradation under photo- and electron-beam exposure. To overcome this limitation, we encapsulate the perovskites with mechanically exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride flakes, forming hexagonal boron nitride/perovskite heterostructures. Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that these heterostructures exhibit significantly reduced electron-beam-induced degradation, enhanced luminescence intensity, a narrower emission bandwidth, and an extended exciton decay time. Moreover, leveraging the scanning capability of our fiber-based cathodoluminescence spectroscopy technique, we demonstrate ultra-long-range exciton transport over distances of approximately 150 micrometers, attributed to exciton-defect coupling. This exciton-defect interaction not only enhances luminescence but also highlights the potential of hexagonal boron nitride/perovskite heterostructures as hybrid van-der-Waals systems with long-range exciton transport and slow radiative decay rates, paving the way for robust and efficient optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Vibration-assisted tunneling through single Au adatoms on two-dimensional WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at 5 K was used to study individual Au atoms adsorbed on the surface of a WSe2 layer grown on epitaxial graphene. In line with theoretical predictions, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal that the weakly bound adatom gives rise to an electronic state within the energy band gap of the WSe2 layer. Adatoms in different surface locations show different gap-state energy values that follow a random distribution around the Fermi level of the sample with a standard deviation of ~50 meV. The location-dependent shift is attributed to spatial variations in disorder potential. Tunneling via the gap state is accompanied by vibrational excitations as apparent from pronounced sideband peaks in the conductance spectra with Poisson-distributed intensities indicating significant electron-phonon coupling with a Huang-Rhys factor of S=2.8. STM tunneling through single Au adatoms on two-dimensional WSe2 constitutes a model case of resonant double-barrier tunneling accompanied by strong coupling to vibrational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction and Dipole-Exchange Curvature Effects on the Spin-Wave Spectra of Magnetic Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores spin-wave dynamics in magnetic nanotubes, focusing on the influence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and curvature. The study uses analytical methods to examine how these factors influence the emergence of nonreciprocity and azimuthal standing waves in nanotubes with longitudinal magnetization along the axis or with a vortex-like magnetization. The interplay between exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and dipolar couplings in determining the chirality of spin waves is discussed. When the magnetization is saturated along an axis, the spin waves propagating along it are symmetric under the inversion of the wave vector. However, magnetochirality, mainly driven by exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya couplings, is observed in the azimuthal standing modes. In the vortex state, frequency nonreciprocity occurs for waves propagating along the tube, while the azimuthal modes remain reciprocal. For positive Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and depending on the helicity of the vortex, the asymmetry induced by the dipolar interaction is reinforced, whereas a negative coupling opposes this asymmetry. The influence of radial anisotropy is also examined. It is found that radial anisotropy reduces the frequency of the modes and shifts the dispersion minimum to a finite wave vector in the vortex state. The properties of modes near zero frequency offer insight into the emergence of chiral magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Electric field tunable spin-orbit gap in a bilayer graphene/WSe$_{2}$ quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the investigation of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a heterostructure of bilayer graphene (BLG) and tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$). A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</description>

      <title>Transmission of low energy electrons through a polyethylene terephthalate 800-nm diameter nanocapillary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transmission of 2-keV electrons through a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanocapillary with a diameter of 800 nm and a length of 10 {\mu}m is studied. The transmitted electrons are detected using a microchannel plate (MCP) with a phosphor screen. It is found that the transmission rate for the transmitted electrons at the incident energy can reach up to 10% for an aligned capillary in the beam direction, but drops to less than 1% when the tilt angle exceeds the geometrically allowable angle. The transmitted electrons with the incident energy do not move with changes in the tilt angle, so the incident electrons are not guided in the insulating capillary, which is different from the behavior of positive ions. In the final stage of transmission, the angular distribution of the transmitted electrons within the geometrically allowable angle splits into two peaks along the observation angle perpendicular to the tilt angle. The time evolution of the transmitted complete angular distribution shows that when the beam is turned on, the transmission profile forms a single peak. As the incident charge and time accumulate, the transmission profile begins to stretch in the plane perpendicular to the tilt angle and gradually splits into two peaks. When the tilt angle of the nanocapillary exceeds the geometrically allowable angle, this splitting tends to disappear. Simulation of charge deposition in the capillary directly exposed to the beam indicates the formation of positive charge patches, which are not conducive to guiding, unlike positive ions. Based on the simulation results, we can explain our data and discuss the possible reasons for the splitting of the transmission angular profiles.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Anomalous Hall States in Twisted Bilayer WSe2 via Attractive Polaron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in semiconductors are predicted to exhibit a rich variety of interaction-induced topological states. However, experimental demonstrations of such topological states, apart from MoTe2 superlattices, have remained scarce. Here, we report the first optical detection of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in twisted WSe2 homobilayer (tWSe2). Specifically, we employ polarization-resolved attractive polaron spectroscopy on a dual-gated, 2 degree tWSe2 and observe direct signatures of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at hole filling {\nu} = 1. Together with a Chern number (C) measurement via Streda formula analysis, we identify this magnetized state as a topological state, characterized by C = 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these topological and magnetic properties are tunable via a finite displacement field, between a QAH ferromagnetic state and an antiferromagnetic state. Our findings position tWSe2 as a highly versatile, stable, and optically addressable platform for investigating topological order and strong correlations in two-dimensional landscapes.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial formation of ultrathin HfO2 on graphene by sequential oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of epitaxial, ultrathin hafnia (HfO2) on graphene. Monoclinic hafnia (m-HfO2) forms as the end of a series of sequential oxidation reactions. Starting from Hf metal grown epitaxially on graphene, oxidation leads first to an amorphous suboxide (a-HfOx), then to a crystalline, hexagonal suboxide (h-HfOx) in epitaxial relationship with the substrate, and finally to m-HfO2 that is also epitaxial. We use scanning transmission electron microscopy to characterize the epitaxial relationships and to investigate the structure of h-HfOx. We propose a series of displacive transformations that relate the different crystalline phases and are consistent with the observed epitaxial relationships with the graphene substrate. ReaxFF based reactive molecular dynamics simulations confirm our model of the oxide phase sequencing, and illustrate the role of graphene in promoting oxide crystallization. Our results suggest a way to achieve heteroepitaxial integration of high-performance, crystalline dielectrics with two dimensional (2D) semiconductors with an atomically sharp interface, which is also relevant to hafnia phase engineering.</description>

      <title>Stability of Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene in Ultra-High Vacuum and in Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was investigated via X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) for two different environmental conditions: ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and ambient pressure. The study is carried out by measuring the C 1s line shape evolution for two hydrogenated samples one kept in the UHV chamber and the other progressively exposed to air. In particular, the $sp^3$ relative intensity in the C 1s core-level spectrum, represented by the area ratio $\frac{sp^3}{sp^2+sp^3}$, was used as a marker for the hydrogenation-level and it resulted to vary by (4 $\pm$ 2)$\%$ in UHV after four months. Thus, a long-term stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was found, that indicates this material as a good candidate for hydrogen (or tritium) storage as long as it is kept in vacuum. On the other hand, the C 1s spectrum of the sample exposed to air shows a significant oxidation. A rapid growth up to saturation of the carbon oxides was observed with a time constant $\tau$ = 1.8 $\pm$ 0.2 hours. Finally, the re-exposure of the oxidised sample to atomic hydrogen was found to be an effective method for the recovery of hydrogenated graphene. This process was studied by carrying out both XPS and electron energy loss spectroscopy, the latter exploited to observe the CH stretching mode as a direct footprint of re-hydrogenation.</description>

      <title>Training and synchronizing oscillator networks with Equilibrium Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillator networks represent a promising technology for unconventional computing and artificial intelligence. Thus far, these systems have primarily been demonstrated in small-scale implementations, such as Ising Machines for solving combinatorial problems and associative memories for image recognition, typically trained without state-of-the-art gradient-based algorithms. Scaling up oscillator-based systems requires advanced gradient-based training methods that also ensure robustness against frequency dispersion between individual oscillators. Here, we demonstrate through simulations that the Equilibrium Propagation algorithm enables effective gradient-based training of oscillator networks, facilitating synchronization even when initial oscillator frequencies are significantly dispersed. We specifically investigate two oscillator models: purely phase-coupled oscillators and oscillators coupled via both amplitude and phase interactions. Our results show that these oscillator networks can scale successfully to standard image recognition benchmarks, such as achieving nearly 98\% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset, despite noise introduced by imperfect synchronization. This work thus paves the way for practical hardware implementations of large-scale oscillator networks, such as those based on spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-orientable Exceptional Points in Twisted Boundary Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orientable manifolds, such as the M\"obius strip and the Klein bottle, defy conventional geometric intuition through their twisted boundary conditions. As a result, topological defects on non-orientable manifolds give rise to novel physical phenomena. We study the adiabatic transport of exceptional points (EPs) along non-orientable closed loops and uncover distinct topological responses arising from the lack of global orientation. Notably, we demonstrate that the cyclic permutation of eigenstates across an EP depends sensitively on the loop orientation, yielding inequivalent braid representations for clockwise and counterclockwise encirclement; this is a feature unique to non-orientable geometries. Orientation-dependent geometric quantities, such as the winding number, cannot be consistently defined due to the absence of a global orientation. However, when a boundary is introduced, such quantities become well defined within the local interior, even though the global manifold remains non-orientable. We further demonstrate the adiabatic evolution of EPs and the emergence of orientation-sensitive observables in a Klein Brillouin zone, described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that preserves momentum-space glide symmetry. Finally, we numerically implement these ideas in a microdisk cavity with embedded scatterers using synthetic momenta.</description>

      <title>Interface, bulk and surface structure of heteroepitaxial altermagnetic {\alpha}-MnTe films grown on GaAs(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epitaxial MnTe films have recently seen a spur of research into their altermagnetic semiconducting properties. However, those properties may be extremely sensitive to structural and chemical modifications. We report a detailed investigation of the synthesis of the altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe on GaAs(111) which reveals the bulk defect structure of this material, the mechanism by which it releases strain from the underlying substrate and the impact of oxidation on its surface. X-ray diffraction measurements show that {\alpha}-MnTe layers with thicknesses spanning 45nm to 640nm acquire lattice parameters different from bulk mostly due to thermal strain caused by the substrate rather than strain from the lattice mismatch. Through high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement, we then unveil a misfit dislocation array at the interface, revealing the mechanism by which lattice strain is relaxed. TEM also reveals a stacking fault in the bulk, occurring along a glide plane parallel to the interface. The combination of TEM with polarized neutron reflectometry measurements finally reveals the impact of oxidation on the chemistry of the surface of uncapped MnTe. Our findings highlight the subtle role of epitaxy in altering the structure of {\alpha}-MnTe providing potential opportunities to tune the altermagnetic properties of this material.</description>

      <title>Gate tunable enhancement of supercurrent in hybrid planar Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) have emerged as a promising platform for the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. To obtain robust quasi one-dimensional (1D) topological superconducting states using planar JJs, limiting the number of 1D Andreev bound states' subbands that can be present, and increasing the size of the topological superconducting gap, are two fundamental challenges. It has been suggested that both problems can be addressed by properly designing the interfaces between the JJ's normal region and the superconducting leads. We fabricated Josephson junctions with periodic hole structures on the superconducting contact leads on InAs heterostructures with epitaxial superconducting Al. By depleting the chemical potential inside the hole region with a top gate, we observed an enhancement of the supercurrent across the junction. Such an enhancement is reproduced in theoretical simulations. The theoretical analysis shows that the enhancement of the JJ's critical current is achieved when the hole depletion is such to optimize the matching of quasiparticles' wave-function at the normal/superconductor interface. These results show how the combination of carefully designed patterns for the Al coverage, and external gates, can be successfully used to tune the density and wave functions' profiles in the normal region of the JJ, and therefore open a new avenue to tune some of the critical properties, such as number of subbands and size of the topological gap, that must be optimized to obtain robust quasi 1D superconducting states supporting Majorana bound states.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast room-temperature valley manipulation in silicon and diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some semiconductors have more than one degenerate minimum of the conduction band in their band structure. These minima-known as valleys-can be used for storing and processing information, if it is possible to generate a difference in their electron populations. However, to compete with conventional electronics, it is necessary to develop universal and fast methods for controlling and reading the valley quantum number of the electrons. Even though selective optical manipulation of electron populations in inequivalent valleys has been demonstrated in two-dimensional crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry, such control is highly desired in many technologically important semiconductor materials, including silicon and diamond. We demonstrate an ultrafast technique for the generation and read-out of a valley-polarized population of electrons in bulk semiconductors on subpicosecond timescales. The principle is based on the unidirectional intervalley scattering of electrons accelerated by an oscillating electric field of linearly polarized infrared femtosecond pulses. Our results are an advance in the development of potential room-temperature valleytronic devices operating at terahertz frequencies and compatible with contemporary silicon-based technology.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Spin Currents in Altermagnets via Magnon Drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently identified class of magnetic materials, possess a spin-split Fermi surface that results in the so-called spin splitter effect, enabling the generation of a spin current transverse to the injection direction and whose polarization lies along the N\'eel vector. In this study, we investigate how magnons interact with electrons in an altermagnetic metal. We find that while the electron-magnon interaction does not perturb the magnon dispersion, a charge current flowing in the material can induce a transverse magnon spin current, analogous to the electronic spin splitter effect. This spin current possesses both electronic and magnonic characteristics, i.e., a chemical potential dependence and a strong temperature dependence. This effect realizes the efficient generation of spin currents via magnons without depending on the material's spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nonlinear Hall effect by Cooper pairs near superconductor criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike the linear Hall effect that requires broken time-reversal symmetry, the nonlinear Hall effect may occur in time-reversal symmetric systems as long as there exists a non-zero Berry curvature dipole in the absence of inversion symmetry. Interestingly, the presence of time-reversal symmetry is consistent with and thus allows a direct transition into a superconducting phase. Indeed, superconductivity has been established in various nonlinear Hall materials, such as WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$, at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the nonlinear Hall response should be significantly enhanced near the superconducting criticality, dominated by the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contributions augmented by superconducting fluctuations, which we attribute to the Berry curvature dipole and a divergent lifetime $\tau\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$ of the Cooper pairs, instead of the single electrons. Such a controlled enhancement brings the nonlinear Hall effect into various simple experimental observations and practical applicational potentials.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal ballistic transport in multi-layer Weyl semimetal films with surface engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl semimetal (WSM) thin films exhibit distinct electronic properties compared to their bulk counterparts. In this study, we theoretically investigate the nonreciprocal ballistic transport phenomena arising in WSM thin films due to surface modifications. Our analysis demonstrates that the nonreciprocity is sub-band-resolved, where the surface states provide the dominant contribution to the nonreciprocity, whereas the bulk states introduce a negative correction. Calculations further reveal a quantum size effect: overall, the nonreciprocal signal decreases with increasing film thickness, but it undergoes discontinuities as the Fermi energy approaches the bottom of a sub-band. Moreover, we observe that the density of states (DOS) in such multi-layer systems exhibits a thickness-independent pattern, which can be effectively explained by a single-variable theory.</description>

      <title>Gate Tunable Josephson Diode Effect in Josephson Junctions made from InAs Nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of Josephson diode effect (JDE) in hybrid devices made from semiconductor InAs nanosheets and superconductor Al contacts. By applying an in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{xy}}$), we detect non-reciprocal superconducting switching current as well as non-reciprocal superconducting retrapping current. The strength of the JDE depends on the angle between the in-plane magnetic field and the bias current ($I_{\mathrm{b}}$), reaching its maximum when $B_{\mathrm{xy}} \perp I_{\mathrm{b}}$ and dropping to nearly zero when $B_{\mathrm{xy}}\parallel I_{\mathrm{b}}$. Additionally, the diode efficiency is tunable via an electrostatic gate with a complete suppression at certain gate voltages. Our findings indicate that the observed JDE in InAs nanosheet-based Josephson junctions most likely arises from the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the nanosheets. Such gate-tunable JDE in Josephson junctions made from semiconductor materials with SOI is useful not only for constructing advanced superconducting electronics but also for detecting novel superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Sagnac Effect on Thermodynamic and Magnetocaloric Properties of a Rotating Two-Dimensional Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of the Sagnac effect on the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a rotating sample under the influence of a uniform magnetic field. We derive an analytical expression for the energy spectrum using an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates inertial forces, and then apply canonical ensemble statistical mechanics to evaluate thermodynamic quantities. The results show that rotation modifies the energy levels, the application of a magnetic field leads to the formation of Landau levels further altered by rotation and gravitational mass, and thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, specific heat, free energy, entropy, magnetization, and magnetocaloric effect) exhibit a strong dependence on these parameters. In particular, the difference between effective mass $m^*$ and gravitational mass $m_G$ influences magnetization and the magnetocaloric effect, with negative rotations potentially inducing a cooling effect when these masses are distinct. We conclude that rotational effects and effective mass properties are crucial for understanding the thermodynamics of electronic systems under magnetic fields, with implications for thermal modulation in semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional superconducting phases are distinguished by broken symmetries in their order parameters. Here, we report the discovery of an exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene at high displacement fields, marked by its coexistence with both a stripe charge order and the anomalous Hall effect. In angle-resolved transport measurements, the onset of stripe order is manifested as thermally activated insulating behavior along one axis, with highly conductive transport along the orthogonal direction. Upon cooling, superconductivity emerges exclusively along the high-conductivity axis, forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels. This anisotropic superconducting phase exhibits multiple first-order hysteretic transitions. Pronounced thermal hysteresis-between warming and cooling across the superconducting transition-suggests a melting transition of the underlying stripe phase. Additionally, magnetic-field-induced switching-similar to phenomena reported in tetra- and pentalayer graphene-supports the chiral nature of the superconducting state. Together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripy Hall crystal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a study of a disorder-dependent real-space representation of the quantum geometry in topological systems. Thanks to the development of an efficient linear-scaling numerical methodology based on the kernel polynomial method, we can explore nontrivial behavior of the integrated quantum metric and Chern number in disordered systems with sizes reaching the experimental scale. We illustrate this approach in the disordered Haldane model, examining the impact of Anderson disorder and vacancies on the trivial and topological phases captured by this model.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Fermi-surface in the current-driven Hidden state of 1T-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the insulating state in 1T-TaS$_2$ has long been a subject of debate. A short current pulse transforms this insulating state into a metastable metallic phase. Using micro-ARPES, we investigate the electronic structure of this phase and uncover spatially dependent modifications caused by the current pulse. In some regions of the sample, a Fermi surface emerges, while others remain gapped. Detailed band structure analysis reveals that the metallic regions exhibit an electronic structure similar to that observed in the high-temperature phase of 1T-TaS$_2$, characterized by suppressed energy gaps and bands crossing the Fermi level. Furthermore, the metallic and insulating regions display distinct dispersions along the out-of-plane direction. These observations suggest a scenario in which the current pulse breaks the star-of-David dimers characteristic of the insulating phase, implicating these dimers as the likely origin of the insulating behavior in 1T-TaS$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired learning in physical hardware has enormous potential to learn fast at minimal energy expenditure. One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions. These results provide a path towards efficient learning in general physical systems which embraces rather than mitigates the noise inherent in physical devices.</description>
