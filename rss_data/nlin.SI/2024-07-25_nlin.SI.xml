      <title>Inverse scattering transform for continuous and discrete space-time shifted integrable equations</title>

Abstract: Nonlocal integrable partial differential equations possessing a spatial or temporal reflection have constituted an active research area for the past decade. Recently, more general classes of these nonlocal equations have been proposed, wherein the nonlocality appears as a combination of a shift (by a real or a complex parameter) and a reflection. This new shifting parameter manifests itself in the inverse scattering transform (IST) as an additional phase factor in an analogous way to the classical Fourier transform. In this paper, the IST is analyzed in detail for several examples of such systems. Particularly, time, space, and space-time shifted nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) and space-time shifted modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations are studied. Additionally, the semi-discrete IST is developed for the time, space and space-time shifted variants of the Ablowitz-Ladik integrable discretization of the NLS. One soliton solutions are constructed for all continuous and discrete cases.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Integrability and Exactly Solvable Dynamics in an Infinite-Range Many-Body Floquet Spin System</title>

Abstract: In a recent work Sharma and Bhosale [Phys. Rev. B, 109, 014412 (2024)], $N$-spin Floquet model having infinite range Ising interaction was introduced. In this paper, we generalized the strength of interaction to $J$, such that $J=1$ case reduces to the aforementioned work. We show that for $J=1/2$ the model still exhibits integrability for an even number of qubits only. We analytically solve the cases of $6$, $8$, $10$, and $12$ qubits, finding its eigensystem, dynamics of entanglement for various initial states, and the unitary evolution operator. These quantities exhibit the signature of quantum integrability (QI). For the general case of even-$N &gt; 12$ qubits, we conjuncture the presence of QI using the numerical evidences such as spectrum degeneracy, and the exact periodic nature of both the entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator. We numerically show the absence of QI for odd $N$ by observing a violation of the signatures of QI. We analytically and numerically find that the maximum value of time-evolved concurrence ($C_{\mbox{max}}$) decreases with $N$, indicating the multipartite nature of entanglement. Possible experiments to verify our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Unitary tetrahedron quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>
