      <title>Quasilinear differential constraints for parabolic systems of Jordan-block type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that linear degeneracy is a necessary conditions for systems in Jordan-block form to admit a compatible quasilinear differential constraint. Such condition is also sufficient for 2x2 systems and turns out to be equivalent to possess the Hamiltonian property. Some explicit solutions of parabolic systems are herein given: two principal hierarchies arising from the associativity theory and the delta-functional reduction of the El's equation in the hard rod case are integrated.</description>

      <title>A general thermodynamical model for finitely-strained continuum with inelasticity and diffusion, its GENERIC derivation in Eulerian formulation, and some application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermodynamically consistent visco-elastodynamical model at finite strains is derived that also allows for inelasticity (like plasticity or creep), thermal coupling, and poroelasticity with diffusion. The theory is developed in the Eulerian framework and is shown to be consistent with the thermodynamic framework given by General Equation for Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling (GENERIC). For the latter we use that the transport terms are given in terms of Lie derivatives. Application is illustrated by two examples, namely volumetric phase transitions with dehydration in rocks and martensitic phase transitions in shape-memory alloys. A strategy towards a rigorous mathematical analysis is only very briefly outlined.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills-Higgs Equations on Spherical Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study (static) solutions of the rank 2 Yang-Mills-Higgs equations on the Riemann sphere, with concical singularities, that bifurcate from constant curvature connections. We focus attention on the case where there are exactly four such singularities. This study brings together ideas from the gauge theory of constant curvature connections on vector bundles over singular Riemann surfaces with the Riemann-Hilbert analysis of classical Fuchsian ODEs.</description>

      <title>Forward lateral photovoltage scanning problem: Perturbation approach and existence-uniqueness analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present analytical results for the so-called forward lateral photovoltage scanning (LPS) problem. The (inverse) LPS model predicts doping variations in crystal by measuring the current leaving the crystal generated by a laser at various positions. The forward model consists of a set of nonlinear elliptic equations coupled with a measuring device modeled by a resistance. Standard methods to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the forward model cannot be used in a straightforward manner due to the presence of an additional generation term modeling the effect of the laser on the crystal. Hence, we scale the original forward LPS problem and employ a perturbation approach to derive the leading order system and the correction up to the second order in an appropriate small parameter. While these simplifications pose no issues from a physical standpoint, they enable us to demonstrate the analytic existence and uniqueness of solutions for the simplified system using standard arguments from elliptic theory adapted to the coupling with the measuring device.</description>

      <title>On the Lorenzoni-Magri hierarchy of hydrodynamic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2005 Lorenzoni and Magri showed that a hydrodynamic-type hierarchy determined by the powers of a type (1,1) tensor field (on a smooth manifold) with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion can be deformed to a more general hierarchy, with the help of a chain of conservation laws of the new hierarchy. We review this construction. The (1,1) tensor fields of the resulting hierarchy have non-vanishing Nijenhuis torsion, in general, but their Haantjes tensor vanishes.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from unitary dynamics in generic quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the preparation of a quantum state using a circuit of depth $t$ from a factorized state of $N$ sites. We argue that in the appropriate scaling limit of large $t$ and $N$, the overlap between states evolved under generic many-body chaotic dynamics belongs to a family of universal distribution that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. This is a consequence of a mapping in the space of replicas to a model of dilute domain walls. Our result provides a rare example in which analysis at an arbitrary number of replicas is possible, giving rise to the complete overlap distribution. Our general picture is derived and corroborated by the exact solution of the random phase model and of an emergent random matrix model given by the Ginibre ensemble. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

      <title>Onsager's "Ideal Turbulence" Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lars Onsager in 1945-1949 made an exact analysis of the high Reynolds-number limit for individual turbulent flow realizations modeled by incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, motivated by experimental observations that dissipation of kinetic energy does not vanish. I review here developments spurred by his key idea, that such flows are well-described by distributional or "weak" solutions of ideal Euler equations. 1/3 H\"older singularities of the velocity field were predicted by Onsager and since observed. His theory describes turbulent energy cascade without probabilistic assumptions and yields a local, deterministic version of the Kolmogorov 4/5th law. The approach is closely related to renormalization group methods in physics and envisages "conservation-law anomalies", as discovered later in quantum field theory. There are also deep connections with Large-Eddy Simulation modeling. More recently, dissipative Euler solutions of the type conjectured by Onsager have been constructed and his 1/3 H\"older singularity proved to be the sharp threshold for anomalous dissipation. This progress has been achieved by an unexpected connection with work of John Nash on isometric embeddings of low regularity or "convex integration" techniques. The dissipative Euler solutions yielded by this method are wildly non-unique for fixed initial data, suggesting "spontaneously stochastic" behavior of high-Reynolds number solutions. I focus in particular on applications to wall-bounded turbulence, leading to novel concepts of spatial cascades of momentum, energy and vorticity to or from the wall as deterministic, space-time local phenomena. This theory thus makes testable predictions and offers new perspectives on Large-Eddy Simulation in presence of solid walls.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Thermal Radiation: A Classical Derivation of the Planck Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A derivation of the Planck spectrum for thermal radiation is given based upon wave fluctuations within relativistic classical physics. The derivation depends crucially on thermal fluctuations existing above the fundamental inertial-frame-independent fluctuations of classical zero-point radiation. Such frame-independent zero-point fluctuations exist only in a relativistic wave theory and cannot exist in a nonrelativistic wave theory. Thus such a classical derivation of the Planck spectrum exists in a Lorentz-covariant classical theory, such as classical electrodynamics, but not in a Galilean-covariant theory where all waves are based upon material media. Classical zero-point radiation provides a purely classical alternative to quanta in the analysis of the Planck spectrum.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane-Shastry (HS) chain. It has a simple realisation via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley-Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like for the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of open strings in the Hard-Wall model of AdS/QCD: the role of $S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a classical open string representing a meson in the hard-wall geometry and consider the $S^5$ compact space. The existence of a confining region due to the hard cut-off leads to a discrete set of string configurations parameterized by the number of complete turnarounds $S^5$ great circles. On the one hand, for a given angular momentum, there is a discrete set of possible separations, and the confined quarks on the boundary are restrict to a lattice. On the other hand, for a given separation in the confining region, there is a discrete set of permitted values for the angular momentum. The $q\bar{q}$ potential is linear for large separations, and the string tension is very sensitive to the angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Communicating skyrmions as the main mechanism underlying skyrmionium (meta)stability in quasi-two-dimensional chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the internal structure of skyrmioniums stabilized in quasi-two-dimensional chiral magnets with easy-axis uniaxial anisotropy. Skyrmioniums are particle-like states of two nested skyrmions with opposite polarities contributing to zero topological charge. The physical principles of skyrmionium stability are drawn from both the analytical analysis with a trial function and from numerical simulations within the framework of micromagnetism. We deduce that the radii of the internal skyrmion with the positive polarity and the ring-shaped external skyrmion with the negative polarity are mutually dependent, which constitutes the paradigm of communicating skyrmions. For large central skyrmions, the skyrmionium transforms into a narrow circular domain wall, whereas for small internal radii, the ring expands, which occurs at the verge of collapsing into an ordinary isolated skyrmion. We show that skyrmioniums may form lattices of two varieties depending on the polarity of the internal skyrmion. At the phase diagram (magnetic field)-(uniaxial anisotropy), both skyrmionium lattices share the same area with one-dimensional spiral states and remain metastable solutions for the whole range of control parameters. By expanding at the critical line, skyrmionium lattices do not release isolated skyrmioniums. Isolated skyrmioniums of just one type exist apart from the corresponding lattice in a narrow field region restricted by the critical line of expansion from below and by the line of collapse above.</description>

      <title>Holographic Renormalization Group and Stress Tensor Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic duality conjectures a relation between strongly coupled quantum systems and quantum gravity in higher-dimensional spacetimes. Gravitational theories in two and three dimensions are meaningful examples for classical and quantum exploration due to their unique characteristics, notably the absence of propagating bulk degrees of freedom and the presence of only boundary degrees of freedom, distinguishing them from higher-dimensional counterparts. These gravitational theories exhibit complex interactions when the bulk spacetime has a finite size, regulated by Zamolodchikov's double-trace irrelevant $T\overline{T}$ operator.
  This thesis aims to gain a holographic understanding of $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and JT gravity under the influence of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation. Under a finite radial cutoff, these theories exhibit perturbative behavior that implies the emergence of the Nambu-Goto action for the corresponding boundary graviton action. We also conducted semi-classical calculations of observables related to finite-cutoff gravity and its dual $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT description, including correlation functions involving stress tensors and gravitational Wilson lines, along with an analysis of their supersymmetric extensions. Additionally, we explored the implications of general stress tensor deformations within field-theoretic and holographic settings.
  This thesis integrates previously adapted publications while also pioneering new ground, notably exploring the definition of a quantum $T\overline{T}$ operator beyond two dimensions with $\frac{1}{N}$ corrections, investigating quantum-corrected higher point correlators for a planar boundary, and offering insights into a two-dimensional spherical boundary at a finite cutoff. Furthermore, throughout the thesis, we show more details in calculations at various points.</description>

      <title>Hypersonic limit for steady compressible Euler flows passing straight cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hypersonic limit for steady, uniform, and compressible polytropic gas passing a symmetric straight cone. By considering Radon measure solutions, we show that as the Mach number of the upstream flow tends to infinity, the measures associated with the weak entropy solution containing an attached shock ahead of the cone converge vaguely to the measures associated with a Radon measure solution to the conical hypersonic-limit flow. This justifies the Newtonian sine-squared pressure law for cones in hypersonic aerodynamics. For Chaplygin gas, assuming that the Mach number of the incoming flow is less than a finite critical value, we demonstrate that the vertex angle of the leading shock is independent of the conical body's vertex angle and is totally determined by the incoming flow's Mach number. If the Mach number exceeds the critical value, we explicitly construct a Radon measure solution with a concentration boundary layer.</description>

Abstract: We revisit dispersionless version of the multicomponent KP hierarchy considered previously by Takasaki and Takebe. In contrast to their study, we do not fix any distinguished component treating all of them on equal footing. We obtain nonlinear equations for dispersionless tau-function (the F-function) and represent them using the trigonometric parametrization. In this trigonometric uniformization the equations considerably simplify and acquire a nice form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the principles of the ETH - Approach to Quantum Mechanics we study fluorescence and the phenomenon of ``quantum jumps'' in idealized models of atoms coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field. In a limiting regime where the orbital motion of the atoms is neglected and the velocity of light tends to infinity we derive explicit non-linear stochastic differential equations describing the effective time evolution of states of individual atoms. These equations give rise to a measure on state-trajectories with quantum jumps which is a quantum-mechanical analogue of the Wiener measure of Brownian motion. Our results amount to a derivation of the fundamental randomness in the quantum-mechanical description of microscopic systems from basic principles in the context of some simple models.</description>

      <title>A bridge between spatial and first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes: from hard walls to absorbing boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. We show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <title>Strong-weak symmetry and quantum modularity of resurgent topological strings on local $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantizing the mirror curve to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold gives rise to quantum operators whose fermionic spectral traces produce factorially divergent formal power series in the Planck constant and its inverse. These are conjecturally captured by the Nekrasov-Shatashvili and standard topological string free energies, respectively, via the TS/ST correspondence. The resurgent structures of the first fermionic spectral trace of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ in both weak and strong coupling limits were solved exactly by the second author in [1]. Here, we take the perspective of the Stokes constants and their generating functions. We prove that a full-fledged strong-weak resurgent symmetry is at play, exchanging the perturbative/nonperturbative contributions to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic blocks in the factorization of the spectral trace. This relies on a global net of relations connecting the perturbative series and the discontinuities in the dual regimes, which is built upon the analytic properties of the $L$-functions with coefficients given by the Stokes constants and the $q$-series acting as their generating functions. Then, we show that the latter are holomorphic quantum modular forms for $\Gamma_1(3)$ and are reconstructed by the median resummation of their asymptotic expansions.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Excitations in the Random Dimer Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground state solution of the random dimer model is at a critical point after, which has been shown with random link excitations. In this paper we test the robustness of the random dimer model to the random link excitation by imposing the maximum weight excitation. We numerically compute the scaling exponents of the curves arising in the model as well as the fractal dimension. Although strong finite size corrections are present, the results are compatible with that of the random link excitation. Furthermore, another form of excitation, the {\epsilon} - coupling excitation is studied. We find that near-optimal configurations belong to the same universality class as the travelling salesman problem. Thus, we confirm a conjecture on the scaling properties of combinatorial optimisation problems, for the specific case of minimum weight perfect matchings on 2-dimensional lattices. This document was submitted as my thesis project for the MSc Complex Systems Modelling course at King's College London in 2021. In particular, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Gabriele Sicuro for his insights and guidance.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production of Quantum Reset Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the entropy production of Quantum Reset Models (QRMs) corresponding to quantum dynamical semigroups driven by Lindbladians motivated by a probabilistic description of dissipation in an external environment. We investigate the strict positivity of entropy production for Lindbladians given as sums of QRMs, when the Hamiltonian of the total Lindbladian is split as an affine combination of Hamiltonians of the individual QRMs. In this setup, we derive conditions on the coefficients of the combination and on the reset states ensuring either positive or zero entropy production. Second, we deal with a tri-partite system subject at its ends to two independent QRMs and a weak coupling Hamiltonian. The latter is split as an affine combination of individual Hamiltonians, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring strict positivity of the entropy production to leading order, with the possible exception of one affine combination. We apply these results to a physically motivated model and exhibit explicit expressions for the leading orders steady-state solution, entropy production and entropy fluxes. Moreover, these approximations are numerically shown to hold beyond the expected regimes.</description>

Abstract: A direct reformulation of the Hamiltonian formalism in terms of the intrinsic geometry of infinitely prolonged differential equations is obtained. Concepts of spatial equation and spatial-gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian system of equations are introduced. A non-covariant canonical variational principle is proposed and demonstrated using the Maxwell equations as an example. A covariant canonical variational principle is formulated. The results obtained are applicable to any variational equations, including those that do not originate in physics.</description>

Abstract: Let $D \subset {\mathbb R}^d,\: d \geqslant 2,$ be the union of a finite collection of pairwise disjoint strictly convex compact obstacles. Let $\mu_j \in {\mathbb C},\: {\rm Im}\: \mu_j &gt; 0,$ be the resonances of the Laplacian in the exterior of $D$ with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial D$. For $d$ odd, $u(t) = \sum_j e^{i |t| \mu_j}$ is a distribution in $ \mathcal{D}'({\mathbb R} \setminus \{0\})$ and the Laplace transforms of the leading singularities of $u(t)$ yield the dynamical zeta functions $\eta_{\mathrm N},\: \eta_{\mathrm D}$ for Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, respectively. These zeta functions play a crucial role in the analysis of the distribution of the resonances. Under the non-eclipse condition (1.1), for $d \geqslant 2$ we show that $\eta_{\mathrm N}$ and $\eta_\mathrm D$ admit a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane. In the particular case when the boundary $\partial D$ is real analytic, by using a result of Fried (1995), we prove that the function $\eta_\mathrm{D}$ cannot be entire. Following the result of Ikawa (1988), this implies the existence of a strip $\{z \in {\mathbb C}: \: 0 &lt; {\rm Im}\: z \leq\alpha\}$ containing an infinite number of resonances $\mu_j$ for the Dirichlet problem. Moreover, for $\alpha \gg 1$ we obtain a lower bound for the resonances lying in this strip.</description>

      <title>A random matrix model for random approximate $t$-designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Haar random set $\mathcal{S}\subset U(d)$ of quantum gates we consider the uniform measure $\nu_\mathcal{S}$ whose support is given by $\mathcal{S}$. The measure $\nu_\mathcal{S}$ can be regarded as a $\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$-approximate $t$-design, $t\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. We propose a random matrix model that aims to describe the probability distribution of $\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$ for any $t$. Our model is given by a block diagonal matrix whose blocks are independent, given by Gaussian or Ginibre ensembles, and their number, size and type is determined by $t$. We prove that, the operator norm of this matrix, $\delta({t})$, is the random variable to which $\sqrt{|\mathcal{S}|}\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$ converges in distribution when the number of elements in $\mathcal{S}$ grows to infinity. Moreover, we characterize our model giving explicit bounds on the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\delta(t)&gt;2+\epsilon)$, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We also show that our model satisfies the so-called spectral gap conjecture, i.e. we prove that with the probability $1$ there is $t\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $\sup_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}}\delta(k)=\delta(t)$. Numerical simulations give convincing evidence that the proposed model is actually almost exact for any cardinality of $\mathcal{S}$. The heuristic explanation of this phenomenon, that we provide, leads us to conjecture that the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\sqrt{\mathcal{S}}\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)&gt;2+\epsilon)$ are bounded from above by the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\delta(t)&gt;2+\epsilon)$ of our random matrix model. In particular our conjecture implies that a Haar random set $\mathcal{S}\subset U(d)$ satisfies the spectral gap conjecture with the probability $1$.</description>

Abstract: Whereas many different models exist in the mathematical and physics literature for ground states of non-relativistic crystals, the relativistic case has been much less studied and we are not aware of any mathematical result on a fully relativistic treatment of crystals. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field relativistic energy for crystals in terms of periodic density matrices. This model is inspired both from a recent definition of the Dirac-Fock ground state for atoms and molecules, due to one of us, and from the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock model for crystals. We prove the existence of a ground state when the number of electrons per cell is not too large.</description>

Abstract: The quantum vacuum interaction energy between a pair of semitransparent two-dimensional plates represented by Dirac delta potentials and its first derivative, embedded in the topological background of a sine-Gordon kink, is studied through an extension of the TGTG-formula (developped by O. Kenneth and I. Klich in the scattering approach). Quantum vacuum oscillations around the sine-Gordon kink solutions are interpreted as a quantum scalar field theory in the spacetime of a domain wall. Moreover, the relation between the phase shift and the density of states (the well-known Dashen-Hasslacher-Neveu formula) is also exploited to characterize the quantum vacuum energy.</description>

      <title>Statistical Complexity of Quantum Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant activity on the problem of using data for the purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing classical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning, quantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating the data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure satisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side information such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of quantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data complexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about quantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine learning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss simultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the paper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we provide extensive background material on classical results from statistical learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states. Throughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide extensive pointers to the literature.</description>

Abstract: We prove a new geometric inequality that relates the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass of initial data to a quasilocal angular momentum of a marginally future trapped surface inner boundary. The inequality is expressed in terms of a 1-spinor, which satisfies an intrinsic first-order Dirac-type equation. Furthermore, we show that if the initial data is axisymmetric, then the divergence-free vector used to define the quasilocal angular momentum cannot be a Killing field of the generic boundary.</description>

Abstract: We consider three-dimensional ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric field theories defined on general complex-valued backgrounds of Euclidean new minimal supergravity admitting two Killing spinors of opposite $R$-charges. We compute partition functions for theories defined on general circle bundles over spindles $\Sigma$, including $\Sigma\times S^1$ as well as branched and squashed lens spaces, thus obtaining novel observables characterizing three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. We discuss both twisted and anti-twisted theories compactified on $\Sigma\times S^1$ and demonstrate that their partition functions are encoded by a single formula that we refer to as the spindle index, unifying and generalizing superconformal and topologically twisted indices in the limit where orbifold singularities are absent. Furthermore, we test our new index using non-perturbative dualities and obtain one-loop determinants of two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories compactified on the spindle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we give a combinatorial formula for a certain class of Koornwinder polynomials, also known as Macdonald polynomials of type $\tilde{C}$. In particular, we give a combinatorial formula for the Koornwinder polynomials $K_{\lambda} = K_{\lambda}(z_1,\dots,z_N; a,b,c,d; q,t)$, where $\lambda = (1,\dots,1,0,\dots,0)$. We also give combinatorial formulas for all ``open boundary ASEP polynomials'' $F_{\mu}$, where $\mu$ is a composition in $\{-1,0,1\}^N$; these polynomials are related to the nonsymmetric Koornwinder polynomials $E_{\mu}$ up to a triangular change of basis. Our formulas are in terms of rhombic staircase tableaux, certain tableaux that we introduced in previous work to give a formula for the stationary distribution of the two-species asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a line with open boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for studying dynamics in QFT: it provides selection rules, constrains RG flows, and often simplifies analysis. Currently, our understanding is that the most general form of symmetry is described by categorical symmetries which can be realized via Symmetry TQFTs or ``SymTFTs." In this paper, we show how the framework of the SymTFT, which is understood for discrete symmetries (i.e. finite categorical symmetries), can be generalized to continuous symmetries. In addition to demonstrating how $U(1)$ global symmetries can be incorporated into the paradigm of the SymTFT, we apply our formalism to study cubic $U(1)$ anomalies in $4d$ QFTs, describe the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ non-invertible chiral symmetry in $4d$ theories, and conjecture the SymTFT for general continuous $G^{(0)}$ global symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to receiver when they share an unlimited amount of noiseless entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>

Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <title>Disorder Chaos in Short-Range, Diluted, and L\'evy Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough [arXiv:2301.04112], Chatterjee proved site disorder chaos in the Edwards-Anderson (EA) short-range spin glass model utilizing the Hermite spectral method. In this paper, we demonstrate the further usefulness of this Hermite spectral approach by extending the validity of site disorder chaos in three related spin glass models.
  The first, called the mixed even $p$-spin short-range model, is a generalization of the EA model where the underlying graph is a deterministic bounded degree hypergraph consisting of hyperedges with even number of vertices. The second model is the diluted mixed $p$-spin model, which is allowed to have hyperedges with both odd and even number of vertices. For both models, our results hold under general symmetric disorder distributions. The main novelty of our argument is played by an elementary algebraic equation for the Fourier-Hermite series coefficients for the two-spin correlation functions. It allows us to deduce necessary geometric conditions to determine the contributing coefficients in the overlap function, which in spirit is the same as the crucial Lemma 1 in [arXiv:2301.04112]. Finally, we also establish disorder chaos in the L\'evy model with stable index $\alpha \in (1, 2)$.</description>
