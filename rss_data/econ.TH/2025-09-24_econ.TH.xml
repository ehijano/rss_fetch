      <title>An Analysis of Monetary Policy Evidence and Theory through Meta-Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a synthesis of the empirical literature on the effects of monetary policy. Using the findings from an extensive collection of meta-analyses, it evaluates the effectiveness of conventional and unconventional monetary policy instruments on key macroeconomic variables such as output, inflation, capital flows, and the exchange rate. The aggregated evidence reveals a systematic gap between the effects reported in primary studies and the actual magnitude of these effects, once corrected for publication bias and methodological heterogeneity. The findings suggest that, while monetary policy is a relevant tool, its power to modulate the business cycle has been consistently overestimated in the literature. Contextual factors - such as the degree of financial development, the exchange rate regime, central bank independence, and crisis conditions - that modulate the transmission of monetary policy are identified. In particular, it is found that publication bias systematically favors statistically significant results consistent with predominant theory, which artificially inflates the perception of effectiveness. By correcting these distortions, a picture of monetary policy emerges with more modest, uncertain effects and considerable lags, which has profound implications for macroeconomic theory and the practice of economic policy.</description>

      <title>A Simple Characterization of Qualified Majority Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note characterizes every qualified majority voting rule with a quota $q$ strictly greater than half of the voter set in environments with just two alternatives through anonymity, responsiveness, and $q$-neutrality. Crucially, the latter imposes independence of the labels of the alternatives only for all preference profiles in which some alternative is strictly top-ranked by at least $q$ voters. Thus, this note generalizes May's (1952, Theorem, p.~682) well-known axiomatic characterization of the simple majority voting rule to qualified majority voting rules with a quota $q$ strictly greater than half of the voter set. In doing so, it shows that these qualified majority voting rules are precisely distinguished by their "degree" of neutrality.</description>

      <title>Business Cycles explained by Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business cycles (a periodic change of e.g. GDP over five to ten years) exist, but a proper explanation for it is still lacking. Here we extend the well-known NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) model, resulting in a set of differ-ential equations. However, the solution is marginal stable. Therefore we find a nat-ural sinusoidal oscillation of inflation and unemployment just as observed in busi-ness cycles. When speculation is present, the instability becomes more severe. So we present for the first time a mathematical explanation for business cycles. The steering of central banks by setting interest rates to keep inflation stable and low needs an overhaul. One has to distinguish between real monetary instability and the one caused naturally by business cycles.</description>

      <title>Persuasion with Ambiguous Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore whether ambiguous communication can be beneficial to the sender in a persuasion problem, when the receiver (and possibly the sender) is ambiguity averse. Our analysis highlights the necessity of using a collection of experiments that form a splitting of an obedient experiment. Some experiments in the collection must be Pareto-ranked in that both players agree on their payoff ranking. If an optimal Bayesian persuasion experiment can be split in this way, then any not-too-ambiguity-averse sender as well as the receiver benefit. There are no benefits when the receiver has only two actions.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Beta: A Causal Take on CAPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CAPM regression is typically interpreted as if the market return contemporaneously \emph{causes} individual returns, motivating beta-neutral portfolios and factor attribution. For realized equity returns, however, this interpretation is inconsistent: a same-period arrow $R_{m,t} \to R_{i,t}$ conflicts with the fact that $R_m$ is itself a value-weighted aggregate of its constituents, unless $R_m$ is lagged or leave-one-out -- the ``aggregator contradiction.'' We formalize CAPM as a structural causal model and analyze the admissible three-node graphs linking an external driver $Z$, the market $R_m$, and an asset $R_i$. The empirically plausible baseline is a \emph{fork}, $Z \to \{R_m, R_i\}$, not $R_m \to R_i$. In this setting, OLS beta reflects not a causal transmission, but an attenuated proxy for how well $R_m$ captures the underlying driver $Z$. Consequently, ``beta-neutral'' portfolios can remain exposed to macro or sectoral shocks, and hedging on $R_m$ can import index-specific noise. Using stylized models and large-cap U.S.\ equity data, we show that contemporaneous betas act like proxies rather than mechanisms; any genuine market-to-stock channel, if at all, appears only at a lag and with modest economic significance. The practical message is clear: CAPM should be read as associational. Risk management and attribution should shift from fixed factor menus to explicitly declared causal paths, with ``alpha'' reserved for what remains invariant once those causal paths are explicitly blocked.</description>

      <title>Publication Design with Incentives in Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The publication process both determines which research receives the most attention, and influences the supply of research through its impact on researchers' private incentives. We introduce a framework to study optimal publication decisions when researchers can choose (i) whether or how to conduct a study and (ii) whether or how to manipulate the research findings (e.g., via selective reporting or data manipulation). When manipulation is not possible, but research entails substantial private costs for the researchers, it may be optimal to incentivize cheaper research designs even if they are less accurate. When manipulation is possible, it is optimal to publish some manipulated results, as well as results that would have not received attention in the absence of manipulability. Even if it is possible to deter manipulation, such as by requiring pre-registered experiments instead of (potentially manipulable) observational studies, it is suboptimal to do so when experiments entail high research costs. We illustrate the implications of our model in an application to medical studies.</description>
