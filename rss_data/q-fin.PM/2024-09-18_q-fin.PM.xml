      <title>Kullback-Leibler cluster entropy to quantify volatility correlation and risk diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler cluster entropy $\mathcal{D_{C}}[P \| Q] $ is evaluated for the empirical and model probability distributions $P$ and $Q$ of the clusters formed in the realized volatility time series of five assets (SP\&amp;500, NASDAQ, DJIA, DAX, FTSEMIB). The Kullback-Leibler functional $\mathcal{D_{C}}[P \| Q] $ provides complementary perspectives about the stochastic volatility process compared to the Shannon functional $\mathcal{S_{C}}[P]$. While $\mathcal{D_{C}}[P \| Q] $ is maximum at the short time scales, $\mathcal{S_{C}}[P]$ is maximum at the large time scales leading to complementary optimization criteria tracing back respectively to the maximum and minimum relative entropy evolution principles. The realized volatility is modelled as a time-dependent fractional stochastic process characterized by power-law decaying distributions with positive correlation ($H&gt;1/2$). As a case study, a multiperiod portfolio built on diversity indexes derived from the Kullback-Leibler entropy measure of the realized volatility. The portfolio is robust and exhibits better performances over the horizon periods. A comparison with the portfolio built either according to the uniform distribution or in the framework of the Markowitz theory is also reported.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment under the Influence of Decision-changing Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-changing imitation is a prevalent phenomenon in financial markets, where investors imitate others' decision-changing rates when making their own investment decisions. In this work, we study the optimal investment problem under the influence of decision-changing imitation involving one leading expert and one retail investor whose decisions are unilaterally influenced by the leading expert. In the objective functional of the optimal investment problem, we propose the integral disparity to quantify the distance between the two investors' decision-changing rates. Due to the underdetermination of the optimal investment problem, we first derive its general solution using the variational method and find the retail investor's optimal decisions under two special cases of the boundary conditions. We theoretically analyze the asymptotic properties of the optimal decision as the influence of decision-changing imitation approaches infinity, and investigate the impact of decision-changing imitation on the optimal decision. Our analysis is validated using numerical experiments on real stock data. This study is essential to comprehend decision-changing imitation and devise effective mechanisms to guide investors' decisions.</description>

      <title>Downside Risk Reduction Using Regime-Switching Signals: A Statistical Jump Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates a regime-switching investment strategy aimed at mitigating downside risk by reducing market exposure during anticipated unfavorable market regimes. We highlight the statistical jump model (JM) for market regime identification, a recently developed robust model that distinguishes itself from traditional Markov-switching models by enhancing regime persistence through a jump penalty applied at each state transition. Our JM utilizes a feature set comprising risk and return measures derived solely from the return series, with the optimal jump penalty selected through a time-series cross-validation method that directly optimizes strategy performance. Our empirical analysis evaluates the realistic out-of-sample performance of various strategies on major equity indices from the US, Germany, and Japan from 1990 to 2023, in the presence of transaction costs and trading delays. The results demonstrate the consistent outperformance of the JM-guided strategy in reducing risk metrics such as volatility and maximum drawdown, and enhancing risk-adjusted returns like the Sharpe ratio, when compared to both hidden Markov model-guided strategy and the buy-and-hold strategy. These findings underline the enhanced persistence, practicality, and versatility of strategies utilizing JMs for regime-switching signals.</description>

      <title>The law of one price in quadratic hedging and mean-variance portfolio selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The law of one price (LOP) broadly asserts that identical financial flows should command the same price. We show that, when properly formulated, LOP is the minimal condition for a well-defined mean-variance portfolio selection framework without degeneracy. Crucially, the paper identifies a new mechanism through which LOP can fail in a continuous-time $L^2$ setting without frictions, namely 'trading from just before a predictable stopping time', which surprisingly identifies LOP violations even for continuous price processes.
  Closing this loophole allows to give a version of the "Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing" appropriate in the quadratic context, establishing the equivalence of the economic concept of LOP with the probabilistic property of the existence of a local $\scr{E}$-martingale state price density. The latter provides unique prices for all square-integrable claims in an extended market and subsequently plays an important role in quadratic hedging and mean-variance portfolio selection.
  Mathematically, we formulate a novel variant of the uniform boundedness principle for conditionally linear functionals on the $L^0$ module of conditionally square-integrable random variables. We then study the representation of time-consistent families of such functionals in terms of stochastic exponentials of a fixed local martingale.</description>
