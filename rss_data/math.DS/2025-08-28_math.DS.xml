      <title>Do triangles matter? Replicating hypergraph disease dynamics with lower-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disease spreading models such as the ubiquitous SIS compartmental model and its numerous variants are widely used to understand and predict the behaviour of a given epidemic or information diffusion process. A common approach to imbue more realism to the spreading process is to constrain simulations to a network structure, where connected nodes update their disease state based on pairwise interactions along the edges of their local neighbourhood. Simplicial contagion models (SCM) extend this to hypergraphs such that groups of three nodes are able to interact and propagate the disease along higher-order hyperedges (triangles). Though more flexible, it is not clear the extent to which the inclusion of these higher-order interactions result in dynamics that are characteristically different to those attained from simpler pairwise interactions. Here, we propose an agent-based model that unifies the classical SIS/SIR compartmental model and SCM, and extends it to allow for interactions along hyperedges of arbitrary order. Using this model, we demonstrate how the steady-state dynamics of pairwise interactions can be made to replicate those of simulations that include higher-order topologies by linearly scaling disease parameters based on a proposed measure network activity. By allowing disease parameters to dynamically vary over time, lower-order pairwise interactions can be made to closely replicate both the transient and steady-state dynamics of higher-order simulations.</description>

      <title>Dimensions and dimension spectra of Non-autonomous iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-autonomous iterated function systems are a generalization of iterated function systems. If the contractions in the system are conformal mappings, it is called a non-autonomous conformal iterated function system, and its attractor is called a non-autonomous conformal set. In this paper, we study intermediate dimension spectra of non-autonomous conformal sets which provide a unifying framework for Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions. First, we obtain the intermediate dimension spectra formula of non-autonomous conformal sets by using upper and lower topological pressures. As a consequence, we obtain simplified forms of their Hausdorff, packing and box dimensions. Finally, we explore the Hausdorff dimensions of the non-autonomous infinite conformal iterated function systems which consists of countably many conformal mappings at each level, and we provide the Hausdorff dimension formula under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Activated Backstepping with Control Barrier Functions for the Safe Navigation of Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel safety-critical control method through the synthesis of control barrier functions (CBFs) for systems with high-relative-degree safety constraints. By extending the procedure of CBF backstepping, we propose activated backstepping - a constructive method to synthesize valid CBFs. The novelty of our method is the incorporation of an activation function into the CBF, which offers less conservative safe sets in the state space than standard CBF backstepping. We demonstrate the proposed method on an inverted pendulum example, where we explain the underlying geometric meaning in the state space and provide comparisons with existing CBF synthesis techniques. Finally, we implement our method to achieve collision-free navigation for automated vehicles using a kinematic bicycle model in simulation.</description>

      <title>Delay-adaptive Control of Nonlinear Systems with Approximate Neural Operator Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay. We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times compared to traditional numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Bridging Finite and Infinite-Horizon Nash Equilibria in Linear Quadratic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) games admit a unique Nash equilibrium, while infinite-horizon settings may have multiple. We clarify the relationship between these two cases by interpreting the finite-horizon equilibrium as a nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we prove that its fixed points are exactly the infinite-horizon equilibria and that any such equilibrium can be recovered by an appropriate choice of terminal costs. We further show that periodic orbits of the dynamical system, when they arise, correspond to periodic Nash equilibria, and we provide numerical evidence of convergence to such cycles. Finally, simulations reveal three asymptotic regimes: convergence to stationary equilibria, convergence to periodic equilibria, and bounded non-convergent trajectories. These findings offer new insights and tools for tuning finite-horizon LQ games using infinite-horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study VERSs (vertex and edge replacement systems) as a technology of graph expansions. We consider its history graph, an augmented tree that records each graph expansion, and we provide sufficient conditions under which it is hyperbolic. When hyperbolic, its Gromov boundary is what we call the limit space of the VERS. We provide three examples from different areas of mathematics: Schreier graphs and limit spaces of finitely generated contracting self-similar groups, injective post-critically finite iterated function systems and limit spaces of edge replacement systems.</description>

      <title>The Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF): A Bounded Possibilistic Framework for Ordinal State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional state estimation methods rely on probabilistic assumptions that often collapse epistemic uncertainty into scalar beliefs, risking overconfidence in sparse or adversarial sensing environments. We introduce the Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF), a novel non-Bayesian filtering framework fully grounded in possibility theory and epistemic humility. ESPF redefines the evolution of belief over state space using compatibility-weighted support updates, surprisalaware pruning, and adaptive dispersion via sparse grid quadrature. Unlike conventional filters, ESPF does not seek a posterior distribution, but rather maintains a structured region of plausibility or non-rejection, updated using ordinal logic rather than integration. For multi-model inference, we employ the Choquet integral to fuse competing hypotheses based on a dynamic epistemic capacity function, generalizing classical winner-take-all strategies. The result is an inference engine capable of dynamically contracting or expanding belief support in direct response to information structure, without requiring prior statistical calibration. This work presents a foundational shift in how inference, evidence, and ignorance are reconciled, supporting robust estimation where priors are unavailable, misleading, or epistemically unjustified.</description>

      <title>Random attractors and nonergodic attractors for diffusions with degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a diffusion on a bounded domain, assuming that the system is irreducible inside the domain and that the diffusion has varying degree of degeneracy on the domain's boundary. The long-term statistical properties of typical trajectories started inside the domain may be governed by one invariant measure or more than one invariant measure. We describe various possible scenarios. In dimensions 1 and 2 under boundary hyperbolicity assumptions, we give a complete classification of the limiting behavior and answer the question whether sequential averaging involving more than one invariant distribution occurs. In all cases, we compute the set of weak limit points of empirical measures. Our hitting-time estimates used to prove transience or recurrence are based on a new version of the Foster-Lyapunov technique. Extensions to nonhyperbolic boundaries and higher dimensions are discussed and an application to growth rates in scalable networks is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Riemannian metrics on 2-surfaces with integrable geodesic flows such that an additional first integral is high-degree polynomial in momenta. This problem reduces to searching for solutions to certain quasi-linear systems of PDEs which turn out to be semi-Hamiltonian. We construct plenty of local explicit and implicit integrable examples with polynomial first integrals of degrees 3, 4, 5. Our construction is essentially based on applying the generalized hodograph method.</description>

      <title>Quantitative relaxation dynamics from generic initial configurations in the inertial Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics of the inertial Kuramoto model toward a phase-locked state from a generic initial phase configuration. For this, we propose a sufficient framework in terms of initial data and system parameters for asymptotic phase-locking. It can be roughly stated as set of conditions such as a positive initial order parameter, a coupling strength sufficiently larger than initial frequency diameter and intrinsic frequency diameter, but less than the inverse of inertia. Under the proposed framework, generic initial configuration undergoes three dynamic stages (initial layer, condensation and relaxation stages) before it reaches a phase-locked state asymptotically. The first stage is the initial layer stage in analogy with fluid mechanics, during which the effect of the initial natural frequency distribution is dominant, compared to that of the sinusoidal coupling between oscillators. The second stage is the condensation stage, during which the order parameter increases, and at the end of which a majority cluster is contained in a sufficiently small arc. Finally, the third stage is the persistence and relaxation stage, during which the majority cluster remains stable (persistence) and the total configuration relaxes toward a phase-locked state asymptotically (relaxation). The intricate proof involves with several key tools such as the quasi-monotonicity of the order parameter (for the condensation stage), a nonlinear Gr\"onwall inequality on the diameter of the majority cluster (for the persistence stage), and a variant of the classical {\L}ojasiewicz gradient theorem (for the relaxation stage).</description>

      <title>Conley-Morse persistence barcode: a homological signature of a combinatorial bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bifurcation characterizes the qualitative changes in parameterized dynamical systems and is one of the major topics in the field. In this work, we study combinatorial bifurcations within the framework of combinatorial dynamical systems -- a young but already well-established theory. We introduce the Conley-Morse persistence barcode, a compact algebraic descriptor of combinatorial bifurcations. This barcode captures structural changes in a dynamical system at the level of Morse decompositions and provides a characterization of the nature of observed transitions in terms of the Conley index. The construction of Conley-Morse persistence barcode builds upon ideas from topological persistence. Specifically, we consider a persistence module obtained from the Conley index of invariant sets indexed over a poset. Using gentle algebras, we prove that this module decomposes into simple intervals (bars) and compute them by adapting the zigzag persistence algorithm to our purpose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a pointwise ergodic theorem and a maximal inequality for actions of amenable groups on noncommutative measure spaces. To do so, we establish a square function estimate quantifying the difference between ergodic averages and some conditional expectations. Our main technical results are the construction of a well-behaved filtration, based on the quasi-tilings of Ornstein and Weiss, and the square function bound, which we derive from non-doubling noncommutative Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition. For actions on usual measure spaces, we obtain new variational ergodic inequalities and jump estimates.</description>
