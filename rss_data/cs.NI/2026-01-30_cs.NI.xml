      <title>ViTMAlis: Towards Latency-Critical Mobile Video Analytics with Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-assisted mobile video analytics (MVA) applications are increasingly shifting from using vision models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to those built on vision transformers (ViTs) to leverage their superior global context modeling and generalization capabilities. However, deploying these advanced models in latency-critical MVA scenarios presents significant challenges. Unlike traditional CNN-based offloading paradigms where network transmission is the primary bottleneck, ViT-based systems are constrained by substantial inference delays, particularly for dense prediction tasks where the need for high-resolution inputs exacerbates the inherent quadratic computational complexity of ViTs. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic mixed-resolution inference strategy tailored for ViT-backboned dense prediction models, enabling flexible runtime trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Building on this, we introduce ViTMAlis, a ViT-native device-to-edge offloading framework that dynamically adapts to network conditions and video content to jointly reduce transmission and inference delays. We implement a fully functional prototype of ViTMAlis on commodity mobile and edge devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-centric, content-aware, and latency-adaptive baselines, ViTMAlis significantly reduces end-to-end offloading latency while improving user-perceived rendering accuracy, providing a practical foundation for next-generation mobile intelligence.</description>

      <title>KubeSpace: A Low-Latency and Stable Control Plane for LEO Satellite Container Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites play a pivotal role in global connectivity-delivering high-speed Internet, cellular coverage, and massive IoT support. With ever-growing onboard computing and storage resources, LEO satellites herald a new cloud paradigm: space cloud computing. While container or chestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) excel in terrestrial data centers, they are ill-suited to LEO satellite networks, featuring geographic dispersion and frequent handovers. Those features bring high latency and intermittent management, leading to control plane failure in container orchestration. To address this, we propose KubeSpace, a low-latency and stable control plane specifically designed for container orchestration on LEO satellites. KubeSpace combines two key innovations: a distributed ground-control-node architecture that binds each satellite to its nearest controller for uninterrupted management, and an orbit-aware placement with dynamic assignment strategy that further minimizes communication latency and handover frequency. Extensive experiments based on real satellite traces demonstrate that compared to existing solutions, KubeSpace reduces the average management latency of satellite nodes by 59% without any management interruption time.</description>

      <title>Age Aware Content Fetching and Broadcast in a Sensing-as-a-Service System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Sensing-as-a-Service (S2aaS) system consisting of a sensor, a set of users, and a sensor cloud service provider (SCSP). The sensor updates its content each time it captures a new measurement. The SCSP occasionally fetches the content from the sensor, caches the latest fetched version and broadcasts it on being requested by the users. The SCSP incurs content fetching costs while fetching and broadcasting the contents. The SCSP also incurs an age cost if users do not receive the most recent version of the content after requesting. We study a content fetching and broadcast problem, aiming to minimize the time-averaged content fetching and age costs. The problem can be framed as a Markov decision process but cannot be elegantly solved owing to its multi-dimensional state space and complex dynamics. To address this, we first obtain the optimal policy for the homogeneous case with all the users having the same request probability and age cost. We extend this algorithm for heterogeneous case but the complexity grows exponentially with the number of users. To tackle this, we propose a low complexity Whittle index based algorithm, which performs very close to the optimal. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in number of users and serves as a heuristic for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Continual Learning for Mobile Edge UAV Networks: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of coordinating mobile edge UAV networks to maintain robust service in highly dynamic spatiotemporal environments. Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when transitioning between distinct task scenarios, such as moving from dense urban clusters to sparse rural areas. These transitions typically necessitate computationally expensive retraining or model resets to adapt to new user distributions, leading to service interruptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a computationally efficient Spatiotemporal Continual Learning (STCL) framework realized through a Group-Decoupled Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (G-MAPPO) algorithm. Our approach integrates a novel Group-Decoupled Policy Optimization (GDPO) mechanism that utilizes dynamic $z$-score normalization to autonomously balance heterogeneous objectives, including energy efficiency, user fairness, and coverage. This mechanism effectively mitigates gradient conflicts induced by concept drifts without requiring offline retraining. Furthermore, the framework leverages the 3D mobility of UAVs as a spatial compensation layer, enabling the swarm to autonomously adjust altitudes to accommodate extreme density fluctuations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed STCL framework achieves superior resilience, characterized by an elastic recovery of service reliability to approximately 0.95 during phase transitions. Compared to the MADDPG baseline, G-MAPPO not only prevents knowledge forgetting but also delivers an effective capacity gain of 20\% under extreme traffic loads, validating its potential as a scalable solution for edge-enabled aerial swarms.</description>

      <title>SymbXRL: Symbolic Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of future 6th-generation (6G) mobile networks will increasingly rely on the ability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize network decisions in real-time. DRL yields demonstrated efficacy in various resource allocation problems, such as joint decisions on user scheduling and antenna allocation or simultaneous control of computing resources and modulation. However, trained DRL agents are closed-boxes and inherently difficult to explain, which hinders their adoption in production settings. In this paper, we make a step towards removing this critical barrier by presenting SymbXRL, a novel technique for explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) that synthesizes human-interpretable explanations for DRL agents. SymbXRL leverages symbolic AI to produce explanations where key concepts and their relationships are described via intuitive symbols and rules; coupling such a representation with logical reasoning exposes the decision process of DRL agents and offers more comprehensible descriptions of their behaviors compared to existing approaches. We validate SymbXRL in practical network management use cases supported by DRL, proving that it not only improves the semantics of the explanations but also paves the way for explicit agent control: for instance, it enables intent-based programmatic action steering that improves by 12% the median cumulative reward over a pure DRL solution.</description>

      <title>SIA: Symbolic Interpretability for Anticipatory Deep Reinforcement Learning in Network Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) promises adaptive control for future mobile networks but conventional agents remain reactive: they act on past and current measurements and cannot leverage short-term forecasts of exogenous KPIs such as bandwidth. Augmenting agents with predictions can overcome this temporal myopia, yet uptake in networking is scarce because forecast-aware agents act as closed-boxes; operators cannot tell whether predictions guide decisions or justify the added complexity. We propose SIA, the first interpreter that exposes in real time how forecast-augmented DRL agents operate. SIA fuses Symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI Knowledge Graphs to produce explanations, and includes a new Influence Score metric. SIA achieves sub-millisecond speed, over 200x faster than existing XAI methods. We evaluate SIA on three diverse networking use cases, uncovering hidden issues, including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward-design biases that trigger counter-productive policies. These insights enable targeted fixes: a redesigned agent achieves a 9% higher average bitrate in video streaming, and SIA's online Action-Refinement module improves RAN-slicing reward by 25% without retraining. By making anticipatory DRL transparent and tunable, SIA lowers the barrier to proactive control in next-generation mobile networks.</description>

      <title>Authenticated encryption for space telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how command stack protection requirements outlined in NASA-STD-1006A can be satisfied within the context of emergency space telemetry. Proposed implementation of lightweight authenticated encryption offers strong security without sacrificing performance in resource-constrained environments. It produces fixed-length messages, maintaining compatibility with the underlying data transport protocols. By focusing on predictable properties and robust authentication, we create a scheme that protects the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of telemetry data in emergency communications while balancing security requirements with the operational constraints.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Probabilistic Skyline Query Processing in Distributed Edge Computing via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the exponential growth of sensor-generated data at the network edge renders efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing a critical challenge. Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.</description>

      <title>Seldom: An Anonymity Network with Selective Deanonymization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While anonymity networks such as Tor provide invaluable privacy guarantees to society, they also enable all kinds of criminal activities. Consequently, many blameless citizens shy away from protecting their privacy using such technology for fear of being associated with criminals. To grasp the potential for alternative privacy protection for those users, we design Seldom, an anonymity network with integrated selective deanonymization that disincentivizes criminal activity. Seldom enables law enforcement agencies to selectively access otherwise anonymized identities of misbehaving users while providing technical guarantees preventing these access rights from being misused. Seldom further ensures translucency, as each access request is approved by a trustworthy consortium of impartial entities and eventually disclosed to the public (without interfering with ongoing investigations). To demonstrate Seldom's feasibility and applicability, we base our implementation on Tor, the most widely used anonymity network. Our evaluation indicates minimal latency, processing, and bandwidth overheads compared to Tor; Seldom's main costs stem from storing flow records and encrypted identities. With at most 636 TB of storage required in total to retain the encrypted identifiers of a Tor-sized network for two years, Seldom provides a practical and deployable technical solution to the inherent problem of criminal activities in anonymity networks. As such, Seldom sheds new light on the potentials and limitations when integrating selective deanonymization into anonymity networks.</description>
