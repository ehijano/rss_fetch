      <title>In vivo solid stress is associated with poor patient survival in glioma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid stress is increasingly being recognized as a key driver of tumor progression and aggressiveness, yet it has not been directly measured in patients so far. Here, we combine multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography with 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based diffeomorphic deformable image registration network analysis to noninvasively quantify glioma-induced solid stress. In both a mouse model and patients, we identified spatially heterogeneous deformation patterns extending well beyond tumor margins. While deformation magnitude was not found to correlate with tumor size or clinical outcome, excess solid stress - defined as the product of peritumoral volumetric strain and stiffness differential between unaffected brain and peritumoral tissue - was inversely associated with patient survival. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first in vivo indication that tumor-associated mechanical stress affects clinical outcomes and can thus serve as a quantitative, imaging-derived biomarker with potential utility for prognostication and treatment guidance in patients with glioma.</description>

      <title>An infection-responsive collagen-based wet-spun textile fibre for wound monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wound infections are a significant clinical and socioeconomic challenge, contributing to delayed healing and increased wound chronicity. To enable early infection detection and inform therapeutic decisions, this study investigated the design of pH-responsive collagen fibres using a scalable wet spinning process, evaluating product suitability for textile dressings and resorbable sutures. Type I collagen was chemically functionalised with 4-vinylbenzyl chloride, enabling UV-induced crosslinking and yielding mechanically robust fibres. Bromothymol blue, a halochromic dye responsive to pH changes, was incorporated via drop-casting to impart visual infection-responsive colour change. Gravimetric analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy confirmed high dye loading, whereby a Loading Efficiency of 99+/-3 wt.% was achieved. The fibres exhibited controlled swelling in aqueous environments (Swelling Ratio: 323+/-79 - 492+/-73 wt.%) and remarkable wet-state Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS: 12+/-3 - 15+/-7 MPa), while up to ca. 30 wt.% of their initial crosslinked mass was retained after 24 hours in a collagenase-rich buffer (pH 7.4, 37{\deg}C, 2 CDU) and ethanol series dehydration. Importantly, distinct and reversible colour transitions were observed between acidic (pH 5) and alkaline (pH 8) environments, with up to 88 wt.% dye retention following 72-hour incubation. The fibres were successfully processed into woven dressing prototypes and demonstrated knotting ability suitable for suture applications. Overall, these wet-spun collagen fibres integrate infection-responsive capability, biodegradability, and scalable fabrication, representing a promising platform for smart wound dressings and resorbable sutures.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Imaging Framework for Three-Dimensional Quantitative Optoacoustic Tomography Using Stochastic Numerical Breast Phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optoacoustic tomography (OAT) is a promising modality for breast cancer diagnosis because tumor angiogenesis and, potentially, hypoxia can be visualized using quantitative OAT (qOAT) techniques. Clinically meaningful inference generally requires accurate image reconstruction, which depends on measurement quality and the imager design. Virtual imaging offers a cost-effective alternative to experimental prototyping for system design evaluation and supports computational method development. This work presents a comprehensive virtual imaging framework for breast qOAT, extending a stochastic numerical breast phantom (NBP) generator by incorporating skin tone variation and both benign and malignant lesions. It enables end-to-end simulation, modeling transducer spatial and acousto-electric impulse responses. Its utility is demonstrated through a case study comparing two system designs. A total of 1,020 NBPs and associated measurement data have been made publicly available to accelerate research in optoacoustic and optical imaging. The framework provides a versatile platform for advancing computational methods and guiding system design optimization.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Quasi-BIC Metasurfaces for Ultra-Sensitive Biosensing and High-Speed Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a revolutionary paradigm in terahertz (THz) photonics, enabling metasurfaces with theoretically infinite quality factors (Q-factors) and unprecedented light-matter control. This review synthesizes a decade of progress in THz-BIC research, tracing the evolution from foundational symmetry-protected designs to application-optimized quasi-BICs. We dissect multipolar origins, topological robustness, and symmetry-breaking strategies underpinning high-Q resonances, alongside computational frameworks for predictive design. The timeline highlights key milestones: early dielectric metasurfaces with high Q-factor, flexible biosensors achieving microgram detection limits, and Kerker-conditioned gas spectrometers reducing path lengths by few orders of magnitude. Emerging frontiers in reconfigurable MEMS-BICs and chiral quantum photonics are critically evaluated. Despite breakthroughs, scalability barriers persist for 6G integration, including nano-fabrication tolerances, material loss trade-offs, and dynamic control gaps. This review establishes BIC metasurfaces as pivotal enablers of compact, high-efficiency THz technologies poised to bridge the gap between fundamental discovery and commercialization of THz-based 6G communication and MedTech.</description>
