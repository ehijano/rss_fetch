      <title>Assessing objective quality metrics for JPEG and MPEG point cloud coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As applications using immersive media gain increasing attention from both academia and industry, research in the field of point cloud compression has greatly intensified in recent years, leading to the development of the MPEG compression standards V-PCC and G-PCC, as well as the more recent JPEG Pleno learning-based point cloud coding. Each of the above-mentioned standards is based on a different algorithm, introducing distinct types of degradation that may impair the quality of experience when high lossy compression is applied. Although the impact on perceptual quality could be accurately evaluated during subjective quality assessment experiments, objective quality metrics serve as predictors of the visually perceived quality and provide similarity scores without human intervention. Nevertheless, their accuracy can be susceptible to the characteristics of the evaluated media as well as to the type and intensity of the added distortion. While the performance of multiple state-of-the-art objective quality metrics has already been evaluated through their correlation with subjective scores obtained in the presence of artifacts produced by the MPEG standards, no study has evaluated how metrics perform with the more recent JPEG Pleno point cloud coding. In this paper, a study is conducted to benchmark the performance of a large set of objective quality metrics in a subjective dataset including distortions produced by JPEG and MPEG codecs. The dataset also contains three different trade-offs between color and geometry compression for each codec, adding another dimension to the analysis. Performance indexes are computed over the entire dataset but also after splitting according to the codec and to the original model, resulting in detailed insights about the overall performance of each visual quality predictor as well as their cross-content and cross-codec generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval beyond the homogeneous object assumption for X-ray in-line holographic imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray near field holography has proven to be a powerful 2D and 3D imaging technique with applications ranging from biomedical research to material sciences. To reconstruct meaningful and quantitative images from the measurement intensities, however, it relies on computational phase retrieval which in many cases assumes the phase-shift and attenuation coefficient of the sample to be proportional. Here, we demonstrate an efficient phase retrieval algorithm that does not rely on this homogeneous-object assumption and is a generalization of the well-established contrast-transfer-function (CTF) approach. We then investigate its stability and present an experimental study comparing the proposed algorithm with established methods. The algorithm shows superior reconstruction quality compared to the established CTF-based method at similar computational cost. Our analysis provides a deeper fundamental understanding of the homogeneous object assumption and the proposed algorithm will help improve the image quality for near-field holography in biomedical applications</description>

      <title>A Modular and Robust Physics-Based Approach for Lensless Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a modular approach for reconstructing lensless measurements. It consists of three components: a newly-proposed pre-processor, a physics-based camera inverter to undo the multiplexing of lensless imaging, and a post-processor. The pre- and post-processors address noise and artifacts unique to lensless imaging before and after camera inversion respectively. By training the three components end-to-end, we obtain a 1.9 dB increase in PSNR and a 14% relative improvement in a perceptual image metric (LPIPS) with respect to previously proposed physics-based methods. We also demonstrate how the proposed pre-processor provides more robustness to input noise, and how an auxiliary loss can improve interpretability.</description>

      <title>Relaxometry Guided Quantitative Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved prestigious performance for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction, enabling fast imaging for many clinical applications. Previous methods employ convolutional networks to learn the image prior as the regularization term. In quantitative MRI, the physical model of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry is known, providing additional prior knowledge for image reconstruction. However, traditional reconstruction networks are limited to learning the spatial domain prior knowledge, ignoring the relaxometry prior. Therefore, we propose a relaxometry-guided quantitative MRI reconstruction framework to learn the spatial prior from data and the relaxometry prior from MRI physics. Additionally, we also evaluated the performance of two popular reconstruction backbones, namely, recurrent variational networks (RVN) and variational networks (VN) with U- Net. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves highly promising results in quantitative MRI reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy for Model-Based Reconstruction in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging is a tracer-based tomographic imaging technique that allows the concentration of magnetic nanoparticles to be determined with high spatio-temporal resolution. To reconstruct an image of the tracer concentration, the magnetization dynamics of the particles must be accurately modeled. A popular ensemble model is based on solving the Fokker-Plank equation, taking into account either Brownian or N\'eel dynamics. The disadvantage of this model is that it is computationally expensive due to an underlying stiff differential equation. A simplified model is the equilibrium model, which can be evaluated directly but in most relevant cases it suffers from a non-negligible modeling error. In the present work, we investigate an extended version of the equilibrium model that can account for particle anisotropy. We show that this model can be expressed as a series of Bessel functions, which can be truncated based on a predefined accuracy, leading to very short computation times, which are about three orders of magnitude lower than equivalent Fokker-Planck computation times. We investigate the accuracy of the model for 2D Lissajous MPI sequences and show that the difference between the Fokker-Planck and the equilibrium model with anisotropy is sufficiently small so that the latter model can be used for image reconstruction on experimental data with only marginal loss of image quality, even compared to a system matrix-based reconstruction.</description>

      <title>ODVista: An Omnidirectional Video Dataset for super-resolution and Quality Enhancement Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omnidirectional or 360-degree video is being increasingly deployed, largely due to the latest advancements in immersive virtual reality (VR) and extended reality (XR) technology. However, the adoption of these videos in streaming encounters challenges related to bandwidth and latency, particularly in mobility conditions such as with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Adaptive resolution and compression aim to preserve quality while maintaining low latency under these constraints, yet downscaling and encoding can still degrade quality and introduce artifacts. Machine learning (ML)-based super-resolution (SR) and quality enhancement techniques offer a promising solution by enhancing detail recovery and reducing compression artifacts. However, current publicly available 360-degree video SR datasets lack compression artifacts, which limit research in this field. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces omnidirectional video streaming dataset (ODVista), which comprises 200 high-resolution and high quality videos downscaled and encoded at four bitrate ranges using the high-efficiency video coding (HEVC)/H.265 standard. Evaluations show that the dataset not only features a wide variety of scenes but also spans different levels of content complexity, which is crucial for robust solutions that perform well in real-world scenarios and generalize across diverse visual environments. Additionally, we evaluate the performance, considering both quality enhancement and runtime, of two handcrafted and two ML-based SR models on the validation and testing sets of ODVista.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical dermatology necessitates precision and innovation for efficient diagnosis and treatment of various skin conditions. This paper introduces the development of a cutting-edge hyperspectral dermatoscope (the Hyperscope) tailored for human skin analysis. We detail the requirements to such a device and the design considerations, from optical configurations to sensor selection, necessary to capture a wide spectral range with high fidelity. Preliminary results from 15 individuals and 160 recorded skin images demonstrate the potential of the Hyperscope in identifying and characterizing various skin conditions, offering a promising avenue for non-invasive skin evaluation and a platform for future research in dermatology-related hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>Graph Theory and GNNs to Unravel the Topographical Organization of Brain Lesions in Variants of Alzheimer's Disease Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes graph theory and deep learning to assess variations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologies, focusing on classic (cAD) and rapid (rpAD) progression forms. It analyses the distribution of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in postmortem brain tissues. Histopathological images are converted into tau-pathology-based graphs, and derived metrics are used for statistical analysis and in machine learning classifiers. These classifiers incorporate SHAP value explainability to differentiate between cAD and rpAD. Graph neural networks (GNNs) demonstrate greater efficiency than traditional CNN methods in analyzing this data, preserving spatial pathology context. Additionally, GNNs provide significant insights through explainable AI techniques. The analysis shows denser networks in rpAD and a distinctive impact on brain cortical layers: rpAD predominantly affects middle layers, whereas cAD influences both superficial and deep layers of the same cortical regions. These results suggest a unique neuropathological network organization for each AD variant.</description>

      <title>Structure Similarity Preservation Learning for Asymmetric Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric image retrieval is a task that seeks to balance retrieval accuracy and efficiency by leveraging lightweight and large models for the query and gallery sides, respectively. The key to asymmetric image retrieval is realizing feature compatibility between different models. Despite the great progress, most existing approaches either rely on classifiers inherited from gallery models or simply impose constraints at the instance level, ignoring the structure of embedding space. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective structure similarity preserving method to achieve feature compatibility between query and gallery models. Specifically, we first train a product quantizer offline with the image features embedded by the gallery model. The centroid vectors in the quantizer serve as anchor points in the embedding space of the gallery model to characterize its structure. During the training of the query model, anchor points are shared by the query and gallery models. The relationships between image features and centroid vectors are considered as structure similarities and constrained to be consistent. Moreover, our approach makes no assumption about the existence of any labeled training data and thus can be extended to an unlimited amount of data. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale landmark retrieval demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is released at: https://github.com/MCC-WH/SSP.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Feature Fusion for Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In asymmetric retrieval systems, models with different capacities are deployed on platforms with different computational and storage resources. Despite the great progress, existing approaches still suffer from a dilemma between retrieval efficiency and asymmetric accuracy due to the limited capacity of the lightweight query model. In this work, we propose an Asymmetric Feature Fusion (AFF) paradigm, which advances existing asymmetric retrieval systems by considering the complementarity among different features just at the gallery side. Specifically, it first embeds each gallery image into various features, e.g., local features and global features. Then, a dynamic mixer is introduced to aggregate these features into compact embedding for efficient search. On the query side, only a single lightweight model is deployed for feature extraction. The query model and dynamic mixer are jointly trained by sharing a momentum-updated classifier. Notably, the proposed paradigm boosts the accuracy of asymmetric retrieval without introducing any extra overhead to the query side. Exhaustive experiments on various landmark retrieval datasets demonstrate the superiority of our paradigm.</description>

      <title>List-Mode PET Image Reconstruction Using Dykstra-Like Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To converge the block iterative method in image reconstruction for positron emission tomography (PET), careful control of relaxation parameters is required, which is a challenging task. The automatic determination of relaxation parameters for list-mode reconstructions also remains challenging. Therefore, a different approach than controlling relaxation parameters would be desired by list-mode PET reconstruction. In this study, we propose a list-mode maximum likelihood Dykstra-like splitting PET reconstruction (LM-MLDS). LM-MLDS converges the list-mode block iterative method by adding the distance from an initial image as a penalty term into an objective function. LM-MLDS takes a two-step approach because its performance depends on the quality of the initial image. The first step uses a uniform image as the initial image, and then the second step uses a reconstructed image after one main iteration as the initial image. We evaluated LM-MLDS using simulation and clinical data. LM-MLDS provided a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and suppressed an oscillation of tradeoff curves between noise and contrast than the other block iterative methods. In a clinical study, LM-MLDS removed the false hotspots at the edge of the axial field of view and improved the image quality of slices covering the top of the head to the cerebellum. LM-MLDS showed different noise properties than the other methods due to Gaussian denoising induced by the proximity operator. The list-mode proximal splitting PET reconstruction is useful not only for optimizing nondifferentiable functions such as total variation but also for converging block iterative methods without controlling relaxation parameters.</description>

      <title>Region-Adaptive Transform with Segmentation Prior for Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) has shown remarkable progress in recent years. Existing works commonly employ CNN-based or self-attention-based modules as transform methods for compression. However, there is no prior research on neural transform that focuses on specific regions. In response, we introduce the class-agnostic segmentation masks (i.e. semantic masks without category labels) for extracting region-adaptive contextual information. Our proposed module, Region-Adaptive Transform, applies adaptive convolutions on different regions guided by the masks. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play module named Scale Affine Layer to incorporate rich contexts from various regions. While there have been prior image compression efforts that involve segmentation masks as additional intermediate inputs, our approach differs significantly from them. Our advantages lie in that, to avoid extra bitrate overhead, we treat these masks as privilege information, which is accessible during the model training stage but not required during the inference phase. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ class-agnostic masks as privilege information and achieve superior performance in pixel-fidelity metrics, such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). The experimental results demonstrate our improvement compared to previously well-performing methods, with about 8.2% bitrate saving compared to VTM-17.0. The code will be released at https://github.com/GityuxiLiu/Region-Adaptive-Transform-with-Segmentation-Prior-for-Image-Compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introducing CSI-Inpainter, a pioneering approach for occlusion removal using Channel State Information (CSI) time sequences, this work propels the application of wireless signal processing into the realm of visual scene recovery. Departing from traditional occlusion removal, CSI-Inpainter leverages CSI data to construct and refine obscured visual elements in a scene, facilitating recovery independent of lighting conditions. Validated through comprehensive testing in both office and industrial environments, CSI-Inpainter demonstrates a robust capacity for discerning and reconstructing occluded segments, establishing a new frontier for obstacle removal. This first-of-its-kind framework offers a transformative perspective on how environmental visual information can be extracted from CSI, thereby broadening the scope for computer vision applications in everyday contexts.</description>

      <title>Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Automated Echocardiography View Recognition: A Holistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To facilitate diagnosis on cardiac ultrasound (US), clinical practice has established several standard views of the heart, which serve as reference points for diagnostic measurements and define viewports from which images are acquired. Automatic view recognition involves grouping those images into classes of standard views. Although deep learning techniques have been successful in achieving this, they still struggle with fully verifying the suitability of an image for specific measurements due to factors like the correct location, pose, and potential occlusions of cardiac structures. Our approach goes beyond view classification and incorporates a 3D mesh reconstruction of the heart that enables several more downstream tasks, like segmentation and pose estimation. In this work, we explore learning 3D heart meshes via graph convolutions, using similar techniques to learn 3D meshes in natural images, such as human pose estimation. As the availability of fully annotated 3D images is limited, we generate synthetic US images from 3D meshes by training an adversarial denoising diffusion model. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and clinical cases for view recognition and structure detection. The approach yielded good performance on synthetic images and, despite being exclusively trained on synthetic data, it already showed potential when applied to clinical images. With this proof-of-concept, we aim to demonstrate the benefits of graphs to improve cardiac view recognition that can ultimately lead to better efficiency in cardiac diagnosis.</description>

      <title>CaveSeg: Deep Semantic Segmentation and Scene Parsing for Autonomous Underwater Cave Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11038v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present CaveSeg - the first visual learning pipeline for semantic segmentation and scene parsing for AUV navigation inside underwater caves. We address the problem of scarce annotated training data by preparing a comprehensive dataset for semantic segmentation of underwater cave scenes. It contains pixel annotations for important navigation markers (e.g. caveline, arrows), obstacles (e.g. ground plain and overhead layers), scuba divers, and open areas for servoing. Through comprehensive benchmark analyses on cave systems in USA, Mexico, and Spain locations, we demonstrate that robust deep visual models can be developed based on CaveSeg for fast semantic scene parsing of underwater cave environments. In particular, we formulate a novel transformer-based model that is computationally light and offers near real-time execution in addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we explore the design choices and implications of semantic segmentation for visual servoing by AUVs inside underwater caves. The proposed model and benchmark dataset open up promising opportunities for future research in autonomous underwater cave exploration and mapping.</description>

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention prediction (PIP) by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is one of the current research challenges in this field. In this article, we introduce PIP-Net, a novel framework designed to predict pedestrian crossing intentions by AVs in real-world urban scenarios. We offer two variants of PIP-Net designed for different camera mounts and setups. Leveraging both kinematic data and spatial features from the driving scene, the proposed model employs a recurrent and temporal attention-based solution, outperforming state-of-the-art performance. To enhance the visual representation of road users and their proximity to the ego vehicle, we introduce a categorical depth feature map, combined with a local motion flow feature, providing rich insights into the scene dynamics. Additionally, we explore the impact of expanding the camera's field of view, from one to three cameras surrounding the ego vehicle, leading to enhancement in the model's contextual perception. Depending on the traffic scenario and road environment, the model excels in predicting pedestrian crossing intentions up to 4 seconds in advance which is a breakthrough in current research studies in pedestrian intention prediction. Finally, for the first time, we present the Urban-PIP dataset, a customised pedestrian intention prediction dataset, with multi-camera annotations in real-world automated driving scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Satellites equipped with optical sensors capture high-resolution imagery, providing valuable insights into various environmental phenomena. In recent years, there has been a surge of research focused on addressing some challenges in remote sensing, ranging from water detection in diverse landscapes to the segmentation of mountainous and terrains. Ongoing investigations goals to enhance the precision and efficiency of satellite imagery analysis. Especially, there is a growing emphasis on developing methodologies for accurate water body detection, snow and clouds, important for environmental monitoring, resource management, and disaster response. Within this context, this paper focus on the cloud segmentation from remote sensing imagery. Accurate remote sensing data analysis can be challenging due to the presence of clouds in optical sensor-based applications. The quality of resulting products such as applications and research is directly impacted by cloud detection, which plays a key role in the remote sensing data processing pipeline. This paper examines seven cutting-edge semantic segmentation and detection algorithms applied to clouds identification, conducting a benchmark analysis to evaluate their architectural approaches and identify the most performing ones. To increase the model's adaptability, critical elements including the type of imagery and the amount of spectral bands used during training are analyzed. Additionally, this research tries to produce machine learning algorithms that can perform cloud segmentation using only a few spectral bands, including RGB and RGBN-IR combinations. The model's flexibility for a variety of applications and user scenarios is assessed by using imagery from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 as datasets. This benchmark can be reproduced using the material from this github link: https://github.com/toelt-llc/cloud_segmentation_comparative.</description>
