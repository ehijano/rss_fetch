      <title>Micromagnet-free operation of electron spin qubits in Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ vertical double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a vertical double quantum dot (DQD) in a Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double-well heterostructure for full electrical control of electron Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, using realistic device modeling and numerical simulations. Due to the emerging spin-orbit interaction in the DQD, as well as strain from the gate electrodes, small (percentage range) but finite $g$ tensor variations emerge. In addition, we find a large valley splitting, on the order of $E_v{\sim}250\,\mu$eV. As a result, multiple avenues for fast electrical single qubit rotations emerge. An ac electric field gives rise to electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), while electron spin resonance (ESR) in the presence of an ac magnetic field can be electrically controlled by local gates due to varying $g$ factors in DQDs. We also show that shuttling between neighboring dots, in vertical and horizontal direction, results in ultrafast single qubit gates of less than a nanosecond. Remarkably, this DQD architecture completely eliminates the need for micromagnets, significantly facilitating the scalability of LD spin qubits in semiconductor foundries.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Enforced Topological Chiral Fermions in Amorphous Chiral Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the prediction and observation of topological Weyl semimetals (chiral TSMs), there have been enormous efforts to characterize further condensed matter realizations of chiral fermions. These efforts were dramatically accelerated by the subsequent discovery of a profound link between low-energy topological and lattice chirality in structurally chiral crystals. Though TSMs are well understood in the limit of perfect translation symmetry, real solid-state materials host defects and disorder, and may even be rendered amorphous down to all but the smallest system length scales. Previous theoretical studies have concluded that chiral TSMs transition into trivial diffusive metals at moderate disorder scales, raising concerns that chiral TSM states may only be accessible in highly crystalline samples. In this work, we in contrast identify large families of chiral TSMs that persist under strong structural disorder - even into the amorphous regime. We show that amorphous chiral TSM phases can in particular be stabilized by the presence of long-range order in the local structural chirality. We present extensive analytic and numerical calculations demonstrating the existence of both Weyl and higher-charge chiral fermions in amorphous metals whose topology and spin and orbital angular momentum textures are tunable via the interplay of average symmetry and geometry. To distinguish and generate new realizations of strongly disordered chiral fermions, we introduce an analytic approach grounded in symmetry group theory. We then introduce an amorphous Wilson loop numerical method to characterize chiral fermions with quantized Berry curvature fluxes in metals with 3D structural disorder. Our findings bridge the crystalline and strongly disordered regimes of chiral TSMs, and indicate a clear route towards engineering geometry-enforced topology in non-crystalline materials and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Pyroelectric effects in hybrid semiconductor-lithium niobate quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum devices using surface acoustic waves show promise as key elements of quantum information processors. We report measurements of integrated flip-chip devices consisting of semiconductor quantum dots and surface acoustic wave resonators in lithium niobate. We observed that the pyroelectric effect in lithium niobate inhibited the operation of quantum dots in the integrated devices. GaAs/AlGaAs devices suffered from unintentional carrier depletion, and Si/SiGe devices suffered from electrostatic discharge. Our results highlight the importance of mitigating pyroelectric effects in semiconductor-lithium niobate hybrid devices for continued progress in quantum interconnects and transducers.</description>

      <title>High-quality and field resilient microwave resonators on Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators integrated with Ge quantum wells (QWs) offer a promising platform for hybrid quantum devices. Yet, in the most common heterostructure architectures, they have so far been limited by sizable photon losses. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of microwave resonators patterned in the Al thin film of an in-situ grown superconductor/semiconductor hybrid heterostructure (HS). The semiconductor part of this hybrid HS is grown on a commercial Ge substrate. We consistently achieve internal quality factors $Q_i&gt;1000$, surpassing previous results on Ge QW heterostructures grown using the concept of a virtual Ge substrate on Si substrates. We reach $Q_i \approx 49000$ at single-photon occupation and a plateau of $Q_i \approx 20000$ at sub-one photon, an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported value of resonators on Ge QW structures at low power. We further characterize the thin Al film forming the resonator, extracting its kinetic inductance and superconducting gap, and studying its magnetic field dependence. Notably, the resonance remains well-defined up to in-plane magnetic fields of 850 mT. A hysteresis emerges in the out-of-plane magnetic field dependence, for both the resonance frequency and the quality factor, indicating an interesting interplay between vortex- and quasiparticle loss mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Optical cooling of nuclear spins in GaAs/(Al,Ga)As quantum wells at subkelvin temperatures: Evidence of the dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in a nominally undoped GaAs/Al$_{0.35}$Ga$_{0.65}$As quantum well using two complementary experimental approaches: time-resolved Kerr rotation and optical orientation measurements of photoluminescence. Using the first technique, we measure a remarkably large Overhauser field of 3.1 T in a geometry close to the Faraday configuration for a 19.7 nm wide quantum well at a temperature of 1.6 K. A nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 $\mu$K is measured at an external magnetic field of 0.006 T following an adiabatic sweep from 0.6 T. Despite the quadrupole-induced nuclear spin splitting inherent to nanostructures, the nuclear spin system is found to follow the predictions of spin temperature theory. Using the optical orientation of the photoluminescence, we investigated nuclear spin dynamics at millikelvin temperatures down to 300 mK. At a temperature of 500 mK, an Overhauser field of 160 mT is generated in an oblique but nearly Voigt magnetic field using low optical power to avoid heating. The nuclear polarization build-up time is of 150 s, consistent with earlier reports at higher temperatures, where hyperfine scattering on free photoexcited electrons governs relaxation. At 500 mK, the onset of dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, which becomes more pronounced as the lattice temperature is further reduced to 300 mK. The estimated nuclear spin temperature in the dynamic self-polarization regime can be as low as 200 nK.</description>

      <title>Intercalant-induced Kekule ordering and gap opening in quasi-free-standing graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural and electronic properties of Sn intercalated buffer layers on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS), spot-profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Sn intercalation effectively decouples the buffer layer, yielding quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) while introducing local lattice distortions. Bias-dependent STM imaging revealed the coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains, governed by the underlying Sn(1x1) reconstruction at the SiC interface. The measured STS spectra exhibit good agreement with DFT results. However, achieving homogeneous Sn(1x1) domains remains challenging, apparently, due to strain within the Sn monolayer, which drives the emergence of Kekule distortions and the associated electronic band-gap opening omogeneously in graphene. These findings highlight the crucial role of intercalant homogeneity and strain in tuning graphene`s structural and electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Electronic states at twist stacking faults in rhombohedral graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands in graphitic materials emerged as a platform for realizing tunable correlated physics. As a nodal-line semimetal, rhombohedral graphite features flat drumhead surface states in the vicinity of the Dirac points, which carry a nontrivial topological charge. We present a comprehensive study on rhombohedral graphite with twist stacking faults. Using both the continuum models and the realistic tight-binding models, we show that the twist angle between the graphene layers can tune the interface states at such stacking faults. The evolution of interface states originates from the interplay between the moir\'e periodicity and Zak phase topology, predicting the occurrence of nearly flat bands throughout the moir\'e Brillouin zone. We further investigate the disorder-induced layer polarization and tunable Chern number for flat band, and characterize the relationship between the disorder strength and Chern number in twisted rhombohedral graphite.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Moir\'e Excitons in Twisted Bilayer CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in van der Waals materials have revolutionized the study of electronic and excitonic systems by creating periodic electrostatic potentials. Extending this concept to magnetic materials promises new pathways in merging spintronics with photonics. While moir\'e magnetism has been revealed with near-field probes and nonlinear optical techniques, the coupling of these magnetic textures to optical excitations - magneto-moir\'e excitons - remains unexplored. Here, we report the observation of magneto-moir\'e excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moir\'e spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2{\deg}. The nanoscale moir\'e spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field. First-principles calculations corroborate that these signatures arise from one-dimensional spin textures governed by the balance of exchange interactions and domain wall energy. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e magnetism can be used to engineer nanoscale excitonic energy landscapes, providing a new platform for magneto-optical sensing, quantum transduction, and control of non-collinear magnetism and topology through light.</description>

      <title>Spin noise of localized electrons in CdTe/CdMgTe quantum well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin dynamics of localized electrons in bulk semiconductors is governed by the interplay of effective nuclear field fluctuations, spin exchange between electrons, and spin transitions into the conduction band. Using spin noise spectroscopy, we reveal this interplay for donor-bound electrons in a CdTe/CdMgTe quantum well and spectrally separate electron spin relaxation and dephasing in zero magnetic field. We identify a specific regime of the electron spin dynamics, where temperature-induced activation of spin-independent hopping leads to a monotonic acceleration of electron spin relaxation. This behavior contrasts with bulk CdTe crystals, where the motional narrowing effect is observed. We attribute this difference to the significantly larger inhomogeneous broadening of the donor-related trion resonance in our quantum well compared to bulk samples. The theoretical analysis of the spin noise power and the strength of the spin exchange interaction provides the estimation of the donor concentration in our unintentionally doped structure.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitons in a suspended 2D antiferromagnetic membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered magnetic and strongly correlated materials present a rich platform for condensed matter physics with intrinsic properties intertwined by magnetism and low-dimensionality. A suspended light-emitting 2D antiferromagnetic membrane forms a highly controllable hybrid system in which the interplay between spin ordering, optical and mechanical degrees of freedom can be uniquely explored. NiPS$_3$ hosts excitons responsible for a puzzling luminescence down to a few atomic layers, linked to its zigzag antiferromagnetic order. The nature of these excitons remains unclear. Here we report on the magnetic excitons of a suspended few-layer NiPS$_3$ membrane. We reveal nematic zigzag states and study the optical transitions induced by the magnon-mediated motion of the excitation in the magnetic lattice, resulting in magnon-dressed excitons. We observe a strain tuning of these emission lines, dependent on their microscopic origin, with rates that sign a strong localization of the magnetic excitons, fading with the number of magnon-mediated hops.</description>

      <title>The role of charge in thermodynamic uncertainty relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the charge value of transport mechanisms heavily impacts the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of plasmons in half-filled graphene via Quantum Monte Carlo and Random Phase Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $\Gamma$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) is a photophysical process where a singlet excitation generates two triplet excited states, enhancing exciton multiplication potentially useful for solar energy conversion. Since SF typically outcompetes radiative decay, single molecule studies of SF have remained elusive. Here, we present single molecule spectroscopy of a terrylenediimide (TDI) dimer at room and cryogenic temperatures. By analysing the stream of photons emitted by single dimers, the rates of formation and decay of SF-born triplet states were determined. We report considerable static and dynamic heterogeneities of the SF process which are reflected in broad rate distributions as well as the occasional occurrence of delayed fluorescence and rate fluctuations during spin evolution. Cryogenic experiments point to the formation of a coherent multiexciton superposition state which decays into the singlet exciton from which a correlated triplet pair evolves. Our results establish single molecule spectroscopy as a new avenue into mechanistic details of the SF process which often are drowned by ensemble av-eraging.</description>

      <title>Rapid reduction of nitrophenols using reusable magnetic \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient and cost-effective conversion of nitro compounds to amines is crucial for industrial processes and environmental remediation, highlighting the growing demand for earth-abundant metal-based catalysts. In this study, magnetic Ni--NiO nanostructures and their composites with two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (\textit{h}-BN) were synthesized via a simple and scalable combustion method. The structural, morphological, and compositional properties of the synthesized materials were systematically investigated using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV--Vis spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of both Ni--NiO and \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanostructures was evaluated using nitrophenol reduction as a model reaction. The \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposite exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to pristine Ni--NiO, highlighting the synergistic interaction between \textit{h}-BN and Ni--NiO nanoparticles. Notably, the magnetic nature of the Ni--NiO core enabled facile recovery of the catalyst using an external magnetic field, and the composite demonstrated excellent stability and reusability for up to six catalytic cycles with minimal loss of activity. The combination of high catalytic efficiency, magnetic separability, and structural stability positions the \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposite as a promising candidate for green and sustainable catalytic applications, particularly in environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Theory of Scalable Spin Squeezing with Disordered Quantum Dipoles</title>

Abstract: Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.</description>

      <title>Designing low-loss cavities across the band-gap of photonic crystal slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) are defects in host photonic crystals (PCs) which create bound states in the PC band gap. These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap. We furthermore report optimised structures of H1 cavities, and provide the optimisation code for widespread use.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism Induced Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces Form Topological Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel type of topological superconductivity based on Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in an altermagnetic topological insulator proximitized by an s-wave superconductor. The 3D altermagnetic topological insulator is characterized by zero-energy surface states in bulk nodal-ring phases and anisotropically shifted surface Dirac cones in topological insulating phases. It is potentially realized in \mathrm{EuIn_{2}As_{2}}. The altermagnetic order in combination with superconductivity gives rise to highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with crystal-facet-dependent BFSs at the physical boundaries. These particular BFSs provide distinct platforms to realize Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We propose a quasi-1D nanowire in which the anisotropic BFSs experience topological phase transitions due to quantum confinement leading to MZMs at its ends. We further consider vortex phase transitions in the superconducting altermagnetic topological insulators. Remarkably, we find that the altermagnetic order allows us to transit between two distinct type of MZMs, one type is located at the vortex line, while the other type is located at the physical boundaries. Our work paves a new avenue utilizing altermagnetism-induced BFSs to engineer topological superconductivity through crystal anisotropy and quantum confinement.</description>

      <title>Geometry, electronic structure, and optical properties of boron cages: A first-principles DFT study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic study of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of cage-like boron clusters, with the number of constituent atoms ranging from 20 to 122, has been carried out within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), employing 6-31G(d, p) extended basis set. The dynamic stability of the clusters is analyzed through the vibrational frequency analysis, while to study the thermodynamic stability, we computed their binding energies per atom. The results suggest that the 32- and 92-atom cages are the most stable among the small and the large structures. The optical absorption spectra of these cages is computed using the time-dependent densityfunctional theory (TDDFT), which suggests their applications in optoelectronic devices in the visible range of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Superconducting Dome Accompanied by Non-Fermi Liquid Transport in Ionic Liquid Gated-MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated superconductors, the emergence of superconductivity is often accompanied by anomalous normal state. The connection between these two phenomena is considered crucial for understanding the underlying unconventional pairing mechanisms. In this study, we report analogous behavior in MoS2, a band insulator devoid of long-range magnetic order. Through ionic liquid gating, continuous doping control from the underdoped to the overdoped regime was achieved, revealing a symmetric superconducting dome that holds characteristic scaling relations mirror the behavior of strongly correlated superconductors. Strikingly, this system exhibits pronounced non-Fermi liquid transport near optimal doping, characterized by a quasi-linear temperature dependence of resistivity over a wide range and a T2-dependent Hall angle cotangent. The strength of the non-Fermi liquid transport is positively correlated with the superconducting transition temperature, with both evolving synchronously across the phase diagram. These results highlight the potential of MoS2 as an ideal platform for studying the intrinsic connection between non-Fermi liquid transport and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Deterministic exciton confinement in 2D semiconductors via local dielectric engineering for scalable quantum light sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters are essential building blocks for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies. However, realizing scalable, on-chip SPEs on a CMOS-compatible platform remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose and theoretically demonstrate a scalable approach to exciton confinement in two-dimensional semiconductors via local dielectric engineering. By introducing a high-dielectric-constant nanopillar above or beneath the 2D material, we create a spatially varying dielectric environment that can support localized exciton states, enabling deterministic, lithography-compatible single-photon emission without relying on strain, defects, or etching of the 2D layer. Using numerical solutions to the 2D excitonic Schrodinger equation, we quantify the resulting confinement through binding energies, wavefunction profiles, and a spatial confinement parameter. These results offer a practical and scalable route for integrating 2D-based quantum emitters into photonic platforms, paving the way for next-generation quantum optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Tensor in the Wild: Resolving Stokes Phenomena via Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard topological invariants, such as the Chern number and Berry phase, form the bedrock of modern quantum matter classification. However, we demonstrate that this framework undergoes a \textbf{catastrophic failure} in the presence of essential singularities -- ubiquitous in open, driven, and non-Hermitian systems ("Wild" regime). In these settings, the local geometric tensor diverges, rendering standard invariants ill-defined and causing perturbative predictions to deviate from reality by order unity ($\sim 100\%$). We resolve this crisis by introducing the \textbf{Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy (FMS)} protocol, a pulse-level control sequence, which experimentally extracts the hidden \textit{Stokes Phenomenon} -- the "missing" geometric data that completes the topological description. By mapping the singularity's Stokes multipliers to time-domain observables, FMS provides a rigorous experimental bridge to \textbf{Resurgence Theory}, allowing for the exact reconstruction of non-perturbative physics from divergent asymptotic series. We validate this framework on a superconducting qudit model, demonstrating that the "Stokes Invariant" serves as the next-generation quantum number for classifying phases of matter beyond the reach of conventional topology.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Exceptional Topology on a Klein Bottle Photonic Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unlocked a wealth of unconventional wave phenomena beyond the reach of Hermitian systems, with exceptional points (EPs) driving enhanced sensitivity, nonreciprocal transport, and topological behavior unique to non-Hermitian degeneracies. Here, we present a scalable and reconfigurable silicon photonic integrated circuit capable of emulating arbitrary non-Hermitian time evolution with high precision. Using this programmable platform, we implement a two-band non-Hermitian Hamiltonian defined on a Klein-bottle topology a nonorientable parameter space that enables exceptional phases forbidden on orientable manifolds. Through an on-chip amplitude-and-phase reconstruction protocol, we retrieve the full complex Hamiltonian at multiple points in parameter space and experimentally map the associated Fermi arc where the imaginary eigenvalue gap closes. The orientation of the measured Fermi arc reveals a nontrivial exceptional topology: it implies the presence of same-charge EPs (or an EP monopole) that cannot annihilate locally on the Klein bottle. Our results demonstrate the first photonic realization of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold and establish a versatile platform for exploring exotic non-Hermitian and topological models relevant to classical and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Multiple topological phases of magnons induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and pseudodipolar anisotropic exchange interactions in Kagome ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome magnets naturally hosting Dirac points and flat bands exhibit novel topological phases, enabling rich interplays between interactions and topologies. The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Controlling Skyrmion Lattice Orientation with Local Magnetic Field Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control over the formation and arrangement of magnetic skyrmion lattices is essential for understanding their emergent behavior and advancing their integration into spintronic and magnonic devices. We report on a simple and minimally invasive technique to nucleate and manipulate skyrmion lattices in soft magnetic CoFeB using single-pass magnetic force microscopy (MFM). By tuning the scan-line spacing to match the intrinsic stripe domain periodicity, the stray field gradient from the MFM tip induces reversible transitions from stripe domains to isolated skyrmions and locally ordered lattices. The resulting skyrmion positions are extracted to compute the local orientational order parameter $\psi_6$, enabling quantitative evaluation of lattice ordering. A systematic improvement in $\langle |\psi_6| \rangle$ is observed with repeated scanning, indicating a transition from a disordered state to ordered hexagonal lattices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the lattice orientation can be deterministically rotated by changing the scanning direction, as confirmed by both real-space analysis and fast Fourier transformations. This method enables the controlled creation, reordering, and deletion of metastable skyrmion textures on demand. Our approach establishes a practical and accessible platform for studying two-dimensional phase behavior in topological spin systems, offering direct and reconfigurable control over lattice symmetry, order, and orientation.</description>

      <title>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10965v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e flatbands with high Chern numbers (C&gt;1) offer opportunities to study the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects that go beyond the Landau level paradigm with C=1, which remain unexplored yet. Here, we target the novel topological phases in high Chern number flatbands by designing a new moir\'e system, i.e., twisted rhombohedral trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe quantized anomalous Hall effects (QAH) with C = 3 at v = 1 and v = 3, demonstrating the high Chern number nature of the flat band from continuum calculations. By fractionally filling the flat band, we observe QAH with C = 2 at even-denominator fractional filling v = 3/2, as well as QAH with C = 3 continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields. Most importantly, we observe, for the first time, evidence of an FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, corresponding to 2/5 filling of a high Chern number flat band with C = -3, verified by both Streda formula analysis and a fractionally QAH. It is also worth noting that Streda formula analysis reveals a signature of another FCI with C = -3/2 at v = 5/2 under finite magnetic fields. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally extended to other twisted graphene moir\'e superlattices based on rhombohedral graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond the paradigm of fractional phases with C &lt; 1.</description>

While chiral organic spacers are known to induce optical activity, the microscopic mechanism by which molecular chirality couples to the inorganic lattice remains unclear. Here, we investigate coherent vibrational dynamics in the chiral perovskite ($R$-MBA)$_2$PbI$_4$ and its racemic analogue using transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by Raman spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations. We identify a coherent phonon at ~5.7 meV that couples strongly to excitons in the chiral material but is absent in the racemic counterpart. This mode is assigned to lattice vibrations involving coupled motion of the chiral spacer and Pb-I framework, including rotational displacement patterns. These results establish coherent lattice motion as a pathway for mediating chiral responses in hybrid materials.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Andreev spectrum and supercurrent in p-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junctions</title>

Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of Andreev bound states and supercurrent in a $p$-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) in one dimension. The studied NHJJ is composed of two topological $p$-wave superconductors connected by a non-Hermitian dissipative junction. Starting from the effective non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de Gennes bulk Hamiltonian, we find that a pair of exceptional points emerge in the complex spectrum of Andreev quasi-bound states. The two exceptional points with zero energy locate symmetrically with respect to Josephson phase difference $\phi=\pi$, at which a Majorana zero mode persists. Notably, the exceptional points descend from a pair of Majorana zero modes after turning on the non-Hermiticity and are topologically protected. By analyzing the non-Hermitian scattering process at the junction, we explicitly demonstrate the loss of quasiparticles through the decay of scattering amplitude probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the supercurrent directly by the inelastic Andreev reflection amplitudes, which provides a more intuitive interpretation of transport properties in NHJJs. The supercurrent varies continuously as a function of $\phi$ across the exceptional points. No enhancement of critical current is observed. We also generalize our analysis to a mixed $s$-$p$ wave NHJJ. Our results provide new insights on transport properties of Josephson junctions in presence of Majorana zero modes, exceptional points, and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved spectral functions of super-moir\'e systems using tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18397</link>

Abstract: Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moir\'e systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moir\'e systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moir\'e systems, including super-moir\'e with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moir\'e patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moir\'e, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moir\'e systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moir\'e systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Ab initio prediction of strain-tunable spin defects in quasi-1D TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19391</link>

Abstract: Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications.</description>
