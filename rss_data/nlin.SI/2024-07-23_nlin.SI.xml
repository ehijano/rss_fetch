      <title>Backlund transformation of Kaup Kupershmidt equations with mutli soliton solutions un Darboux framewor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article encloses the derivation of Darboux solutions for Kaup Kupershmidt equations with their generalization in determinantal form. One of the main focuses of this work is to construct the Backlund transformation for the different solutions of that equation through its associated Riccati equation and then that transformations further reduces to its algebraic analogue with the help of One-fold Darboux solution. Finally, its exact solutions upto three solitons are calculated with their graphical representations which reveal dynamical profiles of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Breather gas fission from elliptic potentials in self-focusing media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical model of integrable turbulence in the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation, generated by a one-parameter family of finite-band elliptic potentials in the semiclassical limit. We show that the spectrum of these potentials exhibits a thermodynamic band/gap scaling compatible with that of soliton and breather gases depending on the value of the elliptic parameter m of the potential. We then demonstrate that, upon augmenting the potential by a small random noise (which is inevitably present in real physical systems), the solution of the fNLS equation evolves into a fully randomized, spatially homogeneous breather gas, a phenomenon we call breather gas fission. We show that the statistical properties of the breather gas at large times are determined by the spectral density of states generated by the unperturbed initial potential. We analytically compute the kurtosis of the breather gas as a function of the elliptic parameter m, and we show that it is greater than 2 for all non-zero m, implying non-Gaussian statistics. Finally, we verify the theoretical predictions by comparison with direct numerical simulations of the fNLS equation. These results establish a link between semiclassical limits of integrable systems and the statistical characterization of their soliton and breather gases.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>
