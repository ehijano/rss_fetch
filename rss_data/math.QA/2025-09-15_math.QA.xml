      <title>On the semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the first author with A. Ardehali, M. Lemos, and L. Rastelli introduced the notion of graded unitarity for vertex algebras. This generalization of unitarity is motivated by the SCFT/VOA correspondence and introduces a novel Hilbert space structure on the state space of a large class of vertex algebras that are not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we study the relative semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras that admit a chiral quantum moment map for an affine current algebra at twice the critical level. We show that the relative semi-infinite chain complex for such a graded-unitary vertex algebra has a structure analogous to that of differential forms on a compact K\"ahler manifold, generalizing a strong form of the classic construction of Banks--Peskin and Frenkel--Garland--Zuckerman. We deduce that the relative semi-infinite cohomology is itself graded-unitary, which establishes graded unitarity for a large class of vertex operator algebras arising from three- and four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories. We further establish an outer USp$(2)$ action on the semi-infinite cohomology (which does not respect cohomological grading), analogous to the Lefschetz $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ in K\"ahler geometry. We also show that the semi-infinite chain complex is quasi-isomorphic as a differential graded vertex algebra to its cohomology, in analogy to the formality result of Deligne--Griffiths--Morgan--Sullivan for the de Rham cohomology of compact K\"ahler manifolds. We conclude by observing consequences of these results to the associated Poisson vertex algebras and related finite-type derived Poisson reductions.</description>

      <title>Induced structures of averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebras via a new splitting of perm algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that an averaging operator on a commutative associative algebra gives rise to a perm algebra. This paper lifts this process to the level of bialgebras. For this purpose, we first give an infinitesimal bialgebra structure for averaging commutative associative algebras and characterize it by double constructions of averaging Frobenius commutative algebras. To find the bialgebra counterpart of perm algebras that is induced by such averaging bialgebras, we need a new two-part splitting of the multiplication in a perm algebra, which differs from the usual splitting of the perm algebra (into the pre-perm algebra) by the characterized representation. This gives rise to the notion of an averaging-pre-perm algebra, or simply an apre-perm algebra. Furthermore, the notion of special apre-perm algebras which are apre-perm algebras with the second multiplications being commutative is introduced as the underlying algebra structure of perm algebras with nondegenerate symmetric left-invariant bilinear forms. The latter are also the induced structures of symmetric Frobenius commutative algebras with averaging operators. Consequently, a double construction of averaging Frobenius commutative algebra gives rise to a Manin triple of special apre-perm algebras. In terms of bialgebra structures, this means that an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra gives rise to a special apre-perm bialgebra.</description>

      <title>Hopf formulae for cocommutative Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adjunction between coalgebras and Hopf algebras, first described by Takeuchi, allows one to prove that the semi-abelian category of cocommutative Hopf algebras has enough $\mathcal E$-projective objects with respect to the class $\mathcal{E}$ of cleft extensions. One then proves that, for any cocommutative Hopf algebra, there exists a weak $\mathcal{E}$-universal normal (=central) extension. This fact allows one to apply the methods of categorical Galois theory to classify normal $\mathcal{E}$-extensions and to provide an explicit description of the fundamental group of a cocommutative Hopf algebra in terms of a generalized Hopf formula. Moreover, with any cleft extension, we associate a 5-term exact sequence in homology that can be seen as a Hopf-theoretic analogue of the classical Stallings-Stammbach exact sequence in group theory.</description>

      <title>Actions of tensor categories on Kirchberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18429v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the simplicity of Pimsner algebras for non-proper C*-correspondences. With the aid of this criterion, we give a systematic strategy to produce outer actions of unitary tensor categories on Kirchberg algebras. In particular, every countable unitary tensor category admits an outer action on the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$. We also study the realizability of modules over fusion rings as K-groups of Kirchberg algebras acted on by unitary tensor categories, which turns out to be generically true for every unitary fusion category. Several new examples are provided, among which actions on Cuntz algebras of 3-cocycle twists of cyclic groups are constructed for all possible 3-cohomological classes, thereby answering a question asked by Izumi.</description>

      <title>Wakimoto construction for double loop algebras and $\zeta$-function regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Feigin-Frenkel homomorphism underpinning the Wakimoto construction realises an affine Lie algebra at critical level in terms of the $\beta\gamma$-system of free fields. It was recently shown that much of the construction also goes through for double loop algebras. However, certain divergent sums appear. In this paper, we show that, suggestively, these sums vanish when one performs $\zeta$-function regularisation.</description>
