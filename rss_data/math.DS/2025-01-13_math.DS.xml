      <title>Natural extensions of embeddable semigroup actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous actions of semigroups over a topological space are discussed. We focus on semigroups that can be embedded into a group, and study the problem of defining a "natural extension," that is, defining a corresponding group action by homeomorphisms over an appropriate space that serves as an invertible extension of the original semigroup action. Both feasibility and infeasibility results are shown for surjective continuous semigroup actions, characterizing the existence of such an extension in terms of algebraic properties of the semigroup. We finish by briefly studying topological dynamical properties of the natural extension in the amenable case.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of orbits at polynomial times in rigid dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distribution of orbits sampled at polynomial times for uniquely ergodic topological dynamical systems $(X, T)$. First, we prove that if there exists an increasing sequence $(q_n)$ for which the rigidity condition \[ \max_{t&lt;q_{n+1}^{4/5}}\sup_{x\in X}d(x, T^{tq_n}x)=o(1) \] is satisfied, then all square orbits $(T^{n^2}x)$ are equidistributed (with respect to the only invariant measure). We show that this rigidity condition might hold for weakly mixing systems, and so as a consequence we obtain first examples of weakly mixing systems where such an equidistribution holds. We also show that for integers $C&gt;1$ a much weaker rigidity condition \[ \max_{t&lt;q_n^{C-1}}\sup\limits_{x\in X}d\left(x, T^{tq_n}x\right)=o(1) \] implies density of all orbits $(T^{n^C}x)$ in totally uniquely ergodic systems, as long as the sequence $(\omega(q_n))$ is bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the dynamical structure of the $p$-adic rational dynamical systems associated with the Sigmoid Beverton-Holt model on the projective line over the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers. Our methods are minimal decomposition of $p$-adic polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ established by Fan and Liao and the chaotic description of $p$-adic repellers of Fan, Liao, Wang and Zhou.</description>

      <title>On recurrence and entropy in hyperspace of continua in dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is a topological graph, and $f$ is continuous map, then the induced map $\tilde{f}$  acting on the hyperspace $C(G)$ of all connected subsets of $G$ by natural formula $\tilde{f}(C)=f(C)$ carries the same entropy as $f$.
  This is well known that it does not hold on the larger hyperspace of all compact subsets. Also negative examples were given for the hyperspace $C(X)$ on some continua $X$, including dendrites.
  Our work extends previous positive results obtained first for much simpler case of compact interval by completely different tools.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic arithmetic progressions in the Fibonacci word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the lengths and starting positions of the longest monochromatic arithmetic progressions for a fixed difference in the Fibonacci word. We provide a complete classification for their lengths in terms of a simple formula. Our strongest results are proved using methods from dynamical systems, especially the dynamics of circle rotations. We also employ computer-based methods in the form of the automatic theorem-proving software Walnut. This allows us to extend recent results concerning similar questions for the Thue-Morse sequence and the Rudin-Shapiro sequence. This also allows us to obtain some results for the Fibonacci word that do not seem to be amenable to dynamical methods.</description>

      <title>Complete heteroclinic networks derived from graphs consisting of two cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question how a given connection structure (directed graph) can be realised as a heteroclinic network that is complete in the sense that it contains all unstable manifolds of its equilibria. For a directed graph consisting of two cycles we provide a constructive method to achieve this: (i) enlarge the graph by adding some edges and (ii) apply the simplex method to obtain a network in phase space. Depending on the length of the cycles we derive the minimal number of required new edges. In the resulting network each added edge leads to a positive transverse eigenvalue at the respective equilibrium. We discuss the total number of such positive eigenvalues in an individual cycle and some implications for the stability of this cycle.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear port-Hamiltonian system identification from input-state-output data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework for identifying nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems using input-state-output data is introduced. The framework utilizes neural networks' universal approximation capacity to effectively represent complex dynamics in a structured way. We show that using the structure helps to make long-term predictions compared to baselines that do not incorporate physics. We also explore different architectures based on MLPs, KANs, and using prior information. The technique is validated through examples featuring nonlinearities in either the skew-symmetric terms, the dissipative terms, or the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Generic controllability of equivariant systems and applications to particle systems and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist many examples of systems which have some symmetries, and which one may monitor with symmetry preserving controls. Since symmetries are preserved along the evolution, full controllability is not possible, and controllability has to be considered inside sets of states with same symmetries. We prove that generic systems with symmetries are controllable in this sense. This result has several applications, for instance:  (i) generic controllability of particle systems when the kernel of interaction between particles plays the role of a mean-field control;  (ii)  generic controllability for families of vector fields on manifolds with boundary; (iii) universal interpolation for neural networks architectures with "generic" self attention-type layers - a type of layers ubiquitous in recent neural networks architectures, e.g., in the Transformers architecture. The tools we develop could help address various other questions of control of equivariant systems.</description>

      <title>Periodic points of endperiodic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $g\colon L\rightarrow L$ be an atoroidal, endperiodic map on an infinite type surface $L$ with no boundary and finitely many ends, each of which is accumulated by genus. By work of Landry, Minsky, and Taylor, $g$ is isotopic to a spun pseudo-Anosov map $f$. We show that spun pseudo-Anosov maps minimize the number of periodic points of period $n$ for sufficiently high $n$ over all maps in their homotopy class, strengthening a theorem of Landry, Minsky, and Taylor. We also show that the same theorem holds for atoroidal Handel--Miller maps when one only considers periodic points that lie in the intersection of the stable and unstable laminations. Furthermore, we show via example that spun-pseudo Anosov and Handel--Miller maps do not always minimize the number of periodic points of low period.</description>

      <title>Measures and dynamics on Pascal-Bratteli diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce stationary generalized Bratteli diagrams $B$ which are represented as the union of countably many classical Pascal-Bratteli diagrams. We describe all ergodic invariant measures on $B$. We show that there exist orders which produce no infinite minimal or maximal paths and the corresponding Vershik map is a homomorphism. We also describe orders on both $B$ and the classical Pascal-Bratteli diagram that generate either uncountably many infinite minimal and uncountably many infinite maximal paths, or uncountably many infinite minimal paths alongside countably infinitely many infinite maximal paths.</description>

      <title>Stability and Synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imagine a group of oscillators, each endowed with their own rhythm or frequency, be it the ticking of a biological clock, the swing of a pendulum, or the glowing of fireflies. While these individual oscillators may seem independent of one another at first glance, the true magic lies in their ability to influence and synchronize with one another, like a group of fireflies glowing in unison.
  The Kuramoto model was motivated by this phenomenon of collective synchronization, when a group of a large number of oscillators spontaneously lock to a common frequency, despite vast differences in their individual frequencies. Inspired by Kuramoto's groundbreaking work in the 1970s, this model captures the essence of how interconnected systems, ranging from biological networks to power grids, can achieve a state of synchronization.
  This work aims to study the stability and synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators, starting off with an introduction to Kuramoto Oscillators and it's broader applications. We then at a graph theoretic formulation for the same and establish various criterion for the stability, synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators. Finally, we broadly analyze and experiment with various physical systems that tend to behave like Kuramoto oscillators followed by further simulations.</description>

      <title>Dimension of self-conformal measures associated to an exponentially separated analytic IFS on $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Hochman's work on exponentially separated self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}$ to the real analytic setting. More precisely, let $\Phi=\left\{ \varphi_{i}\right\} _{i\in\Lambda}$ be an iterated function system on $I:=[0,1]$ consisting of real analytic contractions, let $p=(p_{i})_{i\in\Lambda}$ be a positive probability vector, and let $\mu$ be the associated self-conformal measure. Suppose that the maps in $\Phi$ do not have a common fixed point, $0&lt;\left|\varphi_{i}'(x)\right|&lt;1$ for $i\in\Lambda$ and $x\in I$, and $\Phi$ is exponentially separated. Under these assumptions, we prove that $\dim\mu=\min\left\{ 1,H(p)/\chi\right\} $, where $H(p)$ is the entropy of $p$ and $\chi$ is the Lyapunov exponent.
  The main novelty of our work lies in an argument that reduces convolutions of $\mu$ with measures on the (infinite-dimensional) space of real analytic maps to convolutions with measures on vector spaces of polynomials of bounded degree. The reason for this reduction is that, for the latter convolutions, we can establish an entropy increase result, which plays a crucial role in the proof. We believe that our proof strategy has the potential to extend other significant recent results in the dimension theory of stationary fractal measures to the real analytic setting.</description>
