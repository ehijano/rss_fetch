      <title>Two Generalizations of co-Hopfian Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By defining the classes of generalized co-Hopfian and relatively co-Hopfian groups, respectively, we consider two expanded versions of the generalized co-Bassian groups and of the classical co-Hopfian groups giving a close relationship with them. Concretely, we completely describe generalized co-Hopfian p-groups for some prime p obtaining that such a group is either divisible, or it splits into a direct sum of a special bounded group and a special co-Hopfian group. Furthermore, a comprehensive description of a torsion-free generalized co-Hopfian group is obtained. In addition, we fully characterize when a mixed splitting group and, in certain cases, when a genuinely mixed group are generalized co-Hopfian. Finally, complete characterizations of a super hereditarily generalized co-Hopfian group as well as of a hereditarily generalized co-Hopfian group are given, showing in the latter situation that it decomposes as the direct sum of three specific summands. Moreover, we totally classify relatively co-Hopfian p-groups proving the unexpected fact that they are exactly the co-Hopfian ones. About the torsion-free and mixed cases, we show in light of direct decompositions that in certain situations they are satisfactory classifiable -- e.g., the splitting mixed relatively co-Hopfian groups and the relatively co-Hopfian completely decomposable torsion-free groups. Finally, complete classifications of super and hereditarily relatively co-Hopfian groups are established in terms of ranks which rich us that these two classes curiously do coincide.</description>

      <title>On the Normalizer-Solubilizer Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $x$ be an element of $G$. Define $\Sol_G(x)$ as the set of all $y \in G$ such that $\cyc{x,y}$ is soluble. We provide an equivalent condition for the normalizer-solubilizer conjecture, namely $|\N_G(\cyc{x})| \mid |\Sol_G(x)|$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the conjecture holds in the special case where $\N_G(\cyc{x})$, the normalizer of $\cyc{x}$, is a Frobenius group with kernel $\C_G(x)$, the centralizer of $x$.</description>

      <title>Proportion of Nilpotent Subgroups in Finite Groups and Their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces and investigates the function $J(G) = \frac{\text{Nil}(G)}{L(G)}$, where $\text{Nil}(G)$ denotes the number of nilpotent subgroups and $L(G)$ the total number of subgroups of a finite group $G$. The function $J(G)$, defined over the interval $(0,1]$, serves as a tool to analyze structural patterns in finite groups, particularly within non-nilpotent families such as supersolvable and dihedral groups. Analytical results demonstrate the product density of $J(G)$ values in $(0,1]$, highlighting its distribution across products of dihedral groups. Additionally, a probabilistic analysis was conducted, and based on extensive computational simulations, it was conjectured that the sample mean of $J(G)$ values converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution, in accordance with the Central Limit Theorem, as the sample size increases. These findings expand the understanding of multiplicative functions in group theory, offering novel insights into the structural and probabilistic behavior of finite groups.</description>

      <title>Growth of automorphisms of virtually special groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the speed of growth of iterates of outer automorphisms of virtually special groups, in the Haglund-Wise sense. We show that each automorphism grows either polynomially or exponentially, and that its stretch factor is an algebraic integer. For coarse-median preserving automorphisms, we show that there are only finitely many growth rates and we construct an analogue of the Nielsen-Thurston decomposition of surface homeomorphisms.
  These results are new already for right-angled Artin groups. However, even in this particular case, the proof requires studying automorphisms of arbitrary special groups in an essential way.
  As results of independent interest, we show that special groups are accessibile over centralisers, and we construct a canonical JSJ decomposition over centralisers. We also prove that, for any virtually special group $G$, the outer automorphism group ${\rm Out}(G)$ is boundary amenable, satisfies the Tits alternative, and has finite virtual cohomological dimension.</description>

Abstract: We show that every non-trivial ordered abelian group $G$ is augmentable by infinite elements, i.e., we have $G\preccurlyeq H\oplus G$ for some non-trivial ordered abelian group $H$. As an application, we show that when $k$ is a field of characteristic 0, then $k$ is not $t$-henselian if and only if all henselian valuations with residue field $k$ are ($\emptyset$-)definable.</description>

      <title>Heegaard Floer homology and the word metric on the Torelli group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a relationship between the Heegaard Floer homology correction terms of integral homology spheres and the word metric on the Torelli group. For example, we give an elementary proof that the Cayley graph of the Torelli group has infinite diameter in the word metric induced by the generating set of all separating twists and bounding pair maps. On the other hand, we show that many subsets of the Torelli group are bounded with respect to this metric. Finally, we address the case of rational homology spheres by ruling out a certain Morita-type formula for congruence subgroups of mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of diffeomorphism groups of manifold pairs -- Circle case --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study boundedness of conjugation invariant norms on diffeomorphism groups of manifold pairs. For the diffeomorphism group ${\mathcal D} \equiv {\rm Diff}(M,N)_0$ of a closed manifold pair $(M, N)$ with $\dim N \geq 1$, first we clarify the relation among the fragmentation norm, the conjugation generated norm, the commutator length $cl$ and the commutator length with support in balls $clb$ and show that ${\mathcal D}$ is weakly simple relative to a union of some normal subgroups of ${\mathcal D}$. For the boundedness of these norms, this paper focuses on the case where $N$ is a union of $m$ circles. In this case, the rotation angle on $N$ induces a quasimorphism $\nu : {\rm Isot}(M, N)_0 \to {\Bbb R}^m$, which determines a subgroup $A$ of ${\Bbb Z}^m$ and a function $\widehat{\nu} : {\mathcal D} \to {\Bbb R}^m/A$. If ${\rm rank}\,A = m$, these data leads to an upper bound of $clb$ on ${\mathcal D}$ modulo the normal subgroup ${\mathcal G} \cong {\rm Diff}_c(M - N)_0$. Then, some upper bounds of $cl$ and $clb$ on ${\mathcal D}$ are obtained from those on ${\mathcal G}$. As a consequence, the group ${\mathcal D}$ is uniformly weakly simple and bounded when $\dim M \neq 2,4$. On the other hand, if ${\rm rank}\,A &lt; m$, then the group ${\mathcal D}$ admits a surjective quasimorphism, so it is unbounded and not uniformly perfect. We examine the group $A$ in some explicit examples.</description>

      <title>On the orbit category on nontrivial $p$-subgroups and endotrivial modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, let $G$ be a finite group of order divisible by $p$, and let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p$. An endotrivial $kG$-module is a finitely generated $kG$-module $M$ such that its endomorphism algebra $\operatorname{End}_kM$ decomposes as the direct sum of a one-dimensional trivial $kG$-module and a projective $kG$-module. In this article, we determine the fundamental group of the orbit category on nontrivial $p$-subgroups of $G$ for a large class of finite groups, and use Grodal's approach to describe the group of endotrivial modules for such groups. Hence, we improve on the results about the group of endotrivial modules for finite groups with abelian Sylow $p$-subgroups obtained by Carlson and Th\'evenaz. With some additional analysis, we then determine the fundamental group of the orbit category on nontrivial $p$-subgroups of $G$ and the group of endotrivial $kG$-modules in the case when $G$ has a metacyclic Sylow $p$-subgroup for $p$ odd.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $C^*$-algebra associated by Nekrashevych to a contracting self-similar group is simple if and only if the corresponding complex $\ast$-algebra is simple. We also improve on Steinberg and Szaka\'c's algorithm to determine if the $\ast$-algebra is simple. This provides an interesting class of non-Hausdorff amenable, effective and minimal ample groupoids for which simplicity of the $C^*$-algebra and the complex $\ast$-algebra are equivalent.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel and general algorithm for approximately counting the number of orbits under group actions. The method is based on combining the Burnside process and importance sampling.

      <title>Some examples of affine isometries of Banach spaces arising from 1-D dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a large family of examples of affine isometries of the Banach spaces $C^0 (S^1)$, $L^1 (S^1)$ and $L^2 (S^1 \times S^1)$ that are fixed-point-free despite being recurrent (in particular, they have zero drift). These come from natural cocycles on the group of circle diffeomorphisms, namely the logarithmic, affine and (a variation of the) Schwarzian derivative. Quite interestingly, they arise from diffeomorphisms that are generic in an appropriate context. We also show how to promote these examples in order to obtain families of commuting isometries satisfying the same properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G_n$ denote the space of $n$-generated marked groups. We prove that, for every $n\ge 2$, there exist $2^{\aleph_0}$ non-atomic, $Out(F_n)$-invariant, mixing probability measures on $\mathcal G_n$. On the other hand, there are non-empty closed subsets of $\mathcal G_n$ that admit no $Out(F_n)$-invariant probability measure. Acylindrical hyperbolicity of the group $Aut(F_n)$ plays a crucial role in the proof of both results. We also discuss model theoretic implications of the existence of $Out(F_n)$-invariant, ergodic probability measures on $\mathcal G_n$.</description>

Abstract: n this article, we define orbit data for birational maps of $\mathbf{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$ and show that this data uniquely determines the dynamical degree by providing minimal polynomials for dynamical degrees in terms of orbit data. Leveraging this relationship, we recursively identify all Salem and Pisot numbers that appear in the Weyl spectrum of the union of the Coxeter groups $W_n$ associated with $E_n$ and the set of all dynamical degrees of birational maps of $\mathbf{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all accumulation points of Pisot numbers less than or equal to 2 are present in the Weyl spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We answer the question asked by Louder, McReynolds and Patel, and prove the following statement. Let L be a RAAG, H a word quasiconvex subgroup of L, then there is a finite dimensional representation of L that separates the subgroup H in the induced Zariski topology. As a corollary, we establish a polynomial upper bound on the size of the quotients used to separate H in L. This implies the same statement for a virtually special group L and, in particular, a fundamental groups of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every finitely presented self-similar group embeds in a finitely presented simple group. This establishes that every group embedding in a finitely presented self-similar group satisfies the Boone-Higman conjecture. The simple groups in question are certain commutator subgroups of R\"over-Nekrashevych groups, and the difficulty lies in the fact that even if a R\"over-Nekrashevych group is finitely presented, its commutator subgroup might not be. We also discuss a general example involving matrix groups over certain rings, which in particular establishes that every finitely generated subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q})$ satisfies the Boone-Higman conjecture.</description>

      <title>Things we can learn by considering random locally symmetric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years various results about locally symmetric manifolds were proven using probabilistic approaches. One of the approaches is to consider random manifolds by associating a probability measure to the space of discrete subgroups of the isometry Lie group. The main goals are to prove results about deterministic groups and manifolds by considering appropriate measures. In this overview paper we describe several such results, observing the evolution process of the measures involved. Starting with a result whose proof considered finitely supported measures (more precisely, measures supported on finitely many conjugacy classes) and proceeding with results which were outcome of the successful and popular theory of IRS (invariant random subgroups). In the last couple of years the theory has expanded to SRS (stationary random subgroups) allowing to deal with a lot more problems and establish stronger results. In the last section we shall review a very recent (yet unpublished) result whose proof make use of random subgroups which are not even stationary.</description>

      <title>The quadric flat torus theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a flat torus theorem for quadric complexes. In particular, we show that if a non-cyclic free abelian group $G$ acts metrically properly on a quadric complex $X$, then $G \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$ and $X$ contains a $G$-invariant isometric copy of the regular square tiling of the plane. Along the way, we also give a complete proof of the fact that any closed surface subgroup in the fundamental group of a combinatorial 2-complex is represented by a combinatorial map from a cellulation of the surface that is locally injective away from vertices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tits alternative for groups of almost automorphisms of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a dynamical variant of the Tits alternative for the group of almost automorphisms of a locally finite tree $\mathcal{T}$: a group of almost automorphisms of $\mathcal{T}$ either contains a nonabelian free group playing ping-pong on the boundary $\partial \mathcal{T}$, or the action of the group on $\partial \mathcal{T}$ preserves a probability measure. This generalises to all groups of tree almost automorphisms a result of S. Hurtado and E. Militon for Thompson's group $V$, with a hopefully simpler proof.</description>

      <title>Property (QT) of relatively hierarchically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the projection complex machinery, Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara, Hagen-Petyt and Han-Nguyen-Yang prove that several classes of nonpositively-curved groups admit equivariant quasi-isometric embeddings into finite products of quasi-trees, i.e. having property (QT). In this paper, we unify and generalize the above results by establishing a sufficient condition for relatively hierarchically hyperbolic groups to have property (QT).
  As applications, we show that a group has property (QT) if it is residually finite and belongs to one of the following classes of groups: admissible groups, hyperbolic--$2$--decomposable groups with no distorted elements, Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type. We also introduce a slightly stronger version of property (QT), called property (QT'), and show the invariance of property (QT') under graph products.</description>

      <title>Invariant systems of weighted representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that, if removing some $n$ edges from a graph $\Gamma$ destroys all subgraphs isomorphic to a given finite graph $K$, then all subgraphs isomorphic to $K$ can be destroyed by removing at most $|E(K)|\cdot n$ edges, which form a set invariant with respect to all automorphisms of $\Gamma$. We construct the first examples of (connected) graphs $K$ for which this estimate is not sharp. Our arguments are based on a ``weighted analogue'' of an earlier known estimate for the cost of symmetry.</description>

      <title>(Quantum) discreteness, spectrum compactness and uniform continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a number of results linking properties of actions by compact groups (both quantum and classical) on Banach spaces, such as uniform continuity, spectrum finiteness and extensibility of the actions across several constructions. Examples include: (a) a unitary representation of a compact quantum group induces a continuous action on the $C^*$-algebra of bounded operators if and only if it has finitely many isotypic components, and hence is uniformly continuous; (b) a compact quantum group is finite if and only if its continuous actions on $C^*$-algebras lift to continuous actions on either the multiplier algebras or von Neumann envelopes thereof; (c) a (classical) locally compact group $\mathbb{G}$ is discrete if and only if the forgetful functor from $\mathbb{G}$-acted-upon compact $T_2$ spaces back to compact $T_2$ spaces creates coproducts; (d) a representation of a linearly reductive quantum group has finitely many isotypic components if and only if its restrictions to two topologically-generating quantum subgroups, one of which is normal, do; (e) equivalent characterizations of uniform continuity for actions of compact groups on Banach spaces, e.g. that such an action is uniformly continuous if and only if its restrictions to a pro-torus and to pro-$p$ subgroups are.</description>

      <title>Groups of order 64 and non-homeomorphic double Kodaira fibrations with the same biregular invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_b$ be a closed Riemann surface of genus $b$. We investigate finite quotients $G$ of the pure braid group on two strands $\mathsf{P}_2(\Sigma_b)$ which do not factor through $\pi_1(\Sigma_b \times \Sigma_b)$. Building on our previous work on some special systems of generators on finite groups that we called \emph{diagonal double Kodaira structures}, we prove that, if $G$ has not order $32$, then $|G| \geq 64$, and we completely classify the cases where equality holds. In the last section, as a geometric application of our algebraic results, we construct two $3$-dimensional families of double Kodaira fibrations having the same biregular invariants and the same Betti numbers but different fundamental group.</description>
