      <title>The evasion of tipping: pattern formation near a Turing-fold bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model studies indicate that many climate subsystems, especially ecosystems, may be vulnerable to 'tipping': a 'catastrophic process' in which a system, driven by gradually changing external factors, abruptly transitions (or 'collapses') from a preferred state to a less desirable one. In ecosystems, the emergence of spatial patterns has traditionally been interpreted as a possible 'early warning signal' for tipping. More recently, however, pattern formation has been proposed to serve a fundamentally different role: as a mechanism through which an (eco)system may 'evade tipping' by forming stable patterns that persist beyond the tipping point.
  Mathematically, tipping is typically associated with a saddle-node bifurcation, while pattern formation is normally driven by a Turing bifurcation. Therefore, we study the co-dimension 2 Turing-fold bifurcation and investigate the question: 'When can patterns initiated by the Turing bifurcation enable a system to evade tipping?'
  We develop our approach for a class of phase-field models and subsequently apply it to $n$-component reaction-diffusion systems -- a class of PDEs often used in ecosystem modeling. We demonstrate that a two-component system of modulation equations governs pattern formation near a Turing-fold bifurcation, and that tipping will be evaded when a critical parameter, $\beta$, is positive. We derive explicit expressions for $\beta$, allowing one to determine whether a given system may evade tipping. Moreover, we show numerically that this system exhibits rich behavior, ranging from stable, stationary, spatially quasi-periodic patterns to irregular, spatio-temporal, chaos-like dynamics.</description>

      <title>Borel-Pad\'e exponential asymptotics for the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger model with next-to-nearest neighbour interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we study discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger models combining nearest (NN) and next-nearest (NNN) neighbor interactions, motivated by experiments in waveguide arrays. While we consider the more experimentally accessible case of positive ratio $\mu$ of NNN to NN interactions, we focus on the intriguing case of competing such interactions $(\mu&lt;0)$, where stationary states can exist only for $-1/4 &lt; \mu &lt; 0$. We analyze the key eigenvalues for the stability of the pulse-like stationary (ground) states, and find that such modes depend exponentially on the coupling parameter $\eps$, with suitable polynomial prefactors and corrections that we analyze in detail. Very good agreement of the resulting predictions is found with systematic numerical computations of the associated eigenvalues. This analysis uses Borel-Pad\'{e} exponential asymptotics to determine Stokes multipliers in the solution; these multipliers cannot be obtained using standard matched asymptotic expansion approaches as they are hidden beyond all asymptotic orders, even near singular points. By using Borel-Pad\'{e} methods near the singularity, we construct a general asymptotic template for studying parametric problems which require the calculation of subdominant Stokes multipliers.</description>

      <title>Relating insplittings of 2-graphs and of textile systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graphical operation of insplitting is key to understanding conjugacy of shifts of finite type (SFTs) in both one and two dimensions. In this paper, we consider two approaches to studying 2-dimensional SFTs: textile systems and rank-2 graphs. Nasu's textile systems describe all two-sided 2D SFTs up to conjugacy, whereas the 2-graphs (higher-rank graphs of rank 2) introduced by Kumjian and Pask yield associated C*-algebras. Both models have a naturally-associated notion of insplitting. We show that these notions do not coincide, raising the question of whether insplitting a 2-graph induces a conjugacy of the associated one-sided 2-dimensional SFTs.
  Our first main result shows how to reconstruct 2-graph insplitting using textile-system insplits and inversions, and consequently proves that 2-graph insplitting induces a conjugacy of dynamical systems. We also present several other facets of the relationship between 2-graph insplitting and textile-system insplitting. Incorporating an insplit of the bottom graph of the textile system turns out to be key to this relationship. By articulating the connection between operator-algebraic and dynamical notions of insplitting in two dimensions, this article lays the groundwork for a C*-algebraic framework for classifying one-sided conjugacy in higher-dimensional SFTs.</description>

      <title>Vegetation Patterning Can Both Impede and Trigger Critical Transitions from Savanna to Grassland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-grass coexistence is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, which play an important role in supporting biodiversity and human populations worldwide. While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying processes, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under environmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyze a minimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas. We incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing with trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that these mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna and grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns consisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental conditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the model predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a phenomenon called ''Turing-evades-tipping''). Additionally, we identify a novel ''Turing-triggers-tipping'' mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives tipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included. These transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem transitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical and empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent tipping or drive collapse.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in a Swift-Hohenberg equation with spatially periodic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Swift-Hohenberg equation - a paradigm model for pattern formation - with "large" spatially periodic coefficients and find a Turing bifurcation that generates patterns whose leading order form is a Bloch wave modulated by solutions of a Ginzburg-Landau type equation. Since the interplay between forcing wavenumber and intrinsic wavenumber crucially shapes the spectrum and emerging patterns, we distinguish between resonant and non-resonant regimes. Extending earlier work that assumed asymptotically small coefficients, we tackle the more involved onset analysis produced by O(1) forcing and work directly in Bloch space, where the richer structure of the bifurcating solutions becomes apparent. This abstract framework is readily transferable to more complex systems, such as reaction-diffusion equations arising as dryland vegetation models, where topography induces spatial heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of upper frequently hypercyclic vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a continuous linear operator $T:X\to X$, where $X$ is a topological vector space, let $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ be the set of upper frequently hypercyclic vectors, that is, the set of vectors $x \in X$ such that $\{n \in \omega: T^nx \in U\}$ has positive upper asymptotic density for all nonempty open sets $U\subseteq X$. It is known that $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ is a $G_{\delta\sigma\delta}$-set which is either empty or contains a dense $G_{\delta}$-set. Using a purely topological proof, we improve it by showing that $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ is always a $G_{\delta\sigma}$-set.
  Bonilla and Grosse-Erdmann asked in [Rev. Mat. Complut. \textbf{31} (2018), 673--711] whether $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ is always a $G_{\delta}$-set. We answer such question in the negative, by showing that there exists a continuous linear operator $T$ for which $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ is not a $F_{\sigma\delta}$-set (hence not $G_\delta$). In addition, we study the [non-]equivalence between (the ideal versions of) upper frequently hypercyclicity in the product topology and upper frequently hypercyclicity in the norm topology.</description>

      <title>An iterated random function with Lipschitz number one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the set of functions $f_{\theta}(x)=|\theta -x|$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Define a Markov process that starts with a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and continues with $x_{k+1}=f_{\theta_{k+1}}(x_{k})$ with each $\theta _{k+1}$ picked from a fixed bounded distribution $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^+$. We prove the conjecture of G. Letac that if $\mu$ is not supported on a lattice, then this process has a unique stationary distribution $\pi_{\mu}$ and any distribution converges under iteration to $\pi_{\mu}$ (in the weak-$^*$ topology). We also give a bound on the rate of convergence in the special case that $\mu$ is supported on a two-point set. We hope that the techniques will be useful for the study of other Markov processes where the transition functions have Lipschitz number one.</description>

Abstract: Following the approach of [E1, M1, M2, S1, S2, SZJV] for reaction diffusion systems, we justify rigorously the Eckhaus stability criterion for stability of convective Turing patterns, as derived formally by complex Ginzburg-Landau approximation [SS, NW, WZ]. Notably, our analysis includes also higher-order, nonlocal, and even certain semilinear hyperbolic systems.</description>

Abstract: Expansivity, Li-Yorke chaos and shadowing are popular and well-studied notions of dynamical systems. Several simple and useful characterizations of these notions within the setting of linear dynamics were obtained recently. We explore these three dynamical properties for composition operators $C_{\phi}f = f \circ \phi$ induced by affine self-maps $\phi$ of the right half-plane $\mathbb{C}_{+}$ on the Hardy-Hilbert space $H^{2}(\mathbb{C_{+}})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the dynamical system associated by Putnam to a pair of graph embeddings is identical to the shift map on the limit space of a self-similar groupoid action on a graph. Moreover, performing a certain out-split on said graph gives rise to a Katsura-Exel-Pardo groupoid action on the out-split graph whose associated limit space dynamical system is conjugate to the previous one. We characterise the self-similar properties of these groupoids in terms of properties of their defining data, two matrices $A$, $B$. We prove a large class of the associated limit spaces are bundles of circles and points which fibre over a totally disconnected space, and the dynamics restricted to each circle is of the form $z\to z^{n}$. Moreover, we find a planar embedding of these spaces, thereby answering a question Putnam posed in his paper.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the large scale chaotic, topological structure of the trajectories of an infinite sequence of dispersing, hence ergodic, $2D$ billiards with the configuration space $Q_n=\mathbb{T}^2 \setminus \bigcup_{i=0}^{n-1} D_i$, where the scatterers $D_i$ ($i=0,1,\dots,n-1$) are disks of radius $r&lt;&lt;1$ centered at the points $(i/n, 0)$ mod $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We get effective lower and upper radial bounds for the rotation set $R$. Furthermore, we also prove the compactness of the admissible rotation set $AR$ and the fact that the rotation vectors $v$ corresponding to admissible periodic orbits form a dense subset of $AR$. We also obtain asymptotic lower and upper estimates for the sequence $h_{top}(n)$ of topological entropies and precise asymptotic formulas for the metric entropies $h_{\mu}(n,r)$.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with time-fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, which are characterized by the coexistence of stochastic noise and a fractional power of the Laplacian. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and approximate controllability of a unique mild solution to time-fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. Using a fixed point technique, we first demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to the equation under consideration. We then establish approximate controllability results by using the concepts of fractional calculus, semigroup theory, functional analysis and stochastic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of solutions to some classes of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs with non-monotone nonlinearities, which include the Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation (with all relevant fields and spin torques) and the convective Cahn--Hilliard/Allen--Cahn (CH-AC) equation with a proliferation term, in dimensions $d=1,2,3$. Firstly, we show the global well-posedness, as well as the existence of global and exponential attractors with finite fractal dimensions for these problems. In the case of the exchange-dominated LLBar equation and the CH-AC equation without convection, an estimate for the rate of convergence of the solution to the corresponding stationary state is given. Finally, we show the existence of a robust family of exponential attractors when $d\leq 2$. As a corollary, exponential attractor of the LLBar equation is shown to converge to that of the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation in the limit of vanishing exchange damping, while exponential attractor of the convective CH-AC equation is shown to converge to that of the convective Allen--Cahn equation in the limit of vanishing diffusion coefficient.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the algebraic conditions under which a cellular automaton with a non-linear local rule exhibits surjectivity and reversibility. We also analyze the role of permutivity as a key factor influencing these properties and provide conditions that determine whether a non-linear CA is (bi)permutive. Through theoretical results and illustrative examples, we characterize the relationships between these fundamental properties, offering new insights into the dynamical behavior of non-linear CA.</description>

      <title>Morse theory and moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages</title>

Abstract: We prove that a smooth $d$-manifold $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb R^d$ if it admits a Lyapunov-Reeb function, i.e., a smooth map $f:M\to\mathbb R$ that is proper, lower-bounded, and has a unique critical point. By constructing such functions, we deduce that the moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages and configurations are diffeomorphic to Euclidean spaces. This resolves the Refined Carpenter's Rule Problem and confirms a conjecture proposed by Gonz\'{a}lez and Sedano-Mendoza. We further describe foliation structures of these moduli spaces via level sets of Lyapunov-Reeb functions and develop algorithms for related problems.</description>
