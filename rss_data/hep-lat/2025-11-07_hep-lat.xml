      <title>Classification of four-quark operators with $\Delta F\le 2$ under flavor symmetry and their renormalization in a gauge-invariant scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a complete set of scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark operators, with a particular emphasis on their renormalization within a Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS). We focus on operators that do not mix with lower-dimensional operators by virtue of their transformation properties under the flavor-symmetry group. This class includes all $\Delta F = 2$ operators, as well as their partners that transform under the same irreducible representations of the flavor group. These encompass a substantial subset of $\Delta F = 1$ and $\Delta F = 0$ operators. The present analysis provides a detailed classification of all four-quark operators, exploring their Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. Different variants of GIRS are explored, including a democratic version that treats all mixing operators uniformly. For selected variants, which exhibit smaller mixing effects, we present the conversion matrices from GIRS to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</description>

      <title>Determination of quark-gluon-quark interference within the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarks and gluon, as quantum particles, are subjects to various effects that go beyond the naive parton picture and are not captured by ordinary parton densities. In this work, we investigate the twist-three parton distribution functions, which encode quantum interference between quark-gluon-quark states, and for the first time, determine them directly from experimental data. The analysis combines observables described by collinear and transverse-momentum-dependent factorization theorems within a unified global fit, incorporating a complete leading-order QCD evolution at the twist-three level. The extracted distributions reveal a clear flavor-dependent patterns and distinct from zero at a statistically significant level ($2-3\sigma$). These findings provide the first quantitative evidence for quark-gluon-quark correlations within the proton, revealing its genuinely quantum nature and opening a new direction for precision studies of partonic correlations.</description>

      <title>Continuous matrix product operators for quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators for quantum field theory. We show that (i) they admit a closed-form expression in terms of finite number of matrix-valued functions without reference to any lattice parameter; (ii) they are obtained as a suitable continuum limit of matrix product operators; (iii) they preserve the entanglement area law directly in the continuum, and in particular they map continuous matrix product states (cMPS) to another cMPS. As an application, we use this ansatz to construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond quantum cellular automata.</description>

      <title>A quasi-particle picture for entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of cosmological particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics through the lens of entanglement. We use the entanglement contour (EC) to analyse the spatio-temporal structure of particle production, showing that a quasi-particle picture for the EC captures the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifests through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Some Aspects of Three-Quark Potentials (Part II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>
