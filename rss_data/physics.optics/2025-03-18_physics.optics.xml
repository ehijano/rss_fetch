      <title>Creating high-dimensional topological physics using a single ring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spaces of three or more dimensions, there exists topological physics of significant richness that has no lower-dimensional counterparts. To experimentally explore high-dimensional physics, it is advantageous to augment the physical space with synthetic dimensions. An emerging approach is to use a single modulated photonic ring resonator to form multiple synthetic frequency dimensions. However, all the high-dimensional Hamiltonians experimentally demonstrated in this approach are topologically trivial. Here we propose a general scheme to create high-dimensional topological physics using multiple synthetic frequency dimensions in a single ring resonator. This scheme utilizes specifically designed mode-selective modulations and mode conversions to create non-trivial topology. As examples, we numerically demonstrate a three-dimensional, two-band model exhibiting Weyl points and topological insulator phases, and a five-dimensional, four-band model exhibiting Yang monopoles and Weyl surfaces. Our results will facilitate the experimental studies and future applications of topological physics in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Frequency comb shaping through staggered phase flux in fast gain lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency-comb devices are essential in telecommunications, sensing, and metrology. Yet, precise in-situ control of their spectral envelope remains challenging. We demonstrate a spectral shaping technique leveraging path-dependent phase engineering in the synthetic lattice of cavity modes in a ring-shaped laser with ultrafast gain recovery. By modulating the laser at its repetition rate and twice this frequency, we create a 1D triangular ladder with a staggered phase flux, which breaks time-reversal symmetry. This enables continuous tuning of a strong central lobe across the full bandwidth of our Quantum Cascade Laser frequency comb at 1340cm$^{-1}$. Our method offers unprecedented spectral control at the light generation stage in any fast gain active device, opening new opportunities in waveform engineering for ranging, data transmission, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast space-time optical merons in momentum-energy space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions, topologically non-trivial localized spin structures, are fertile ground for exploring emergent phenomena in condensed matter physics and next-generation magnetic-memory technologies. Although magnetics and optics readily lend themselves to two-dimensional realizations of spin texture, only recently have breakthroughs brought forth three-dimensional (3D) magnetic skyrmions, whereas their optical counterparts have eluded observation to date because their realization requires precise control over the spatiotemporal spectrum. Here, we demonstrate the first 3D-localized optical skyrmionic structures with a non-trivial topological spin profile by imprinting meron spin texture on open and closed spectral surfaces in the momentum-energy space of an ultrafast optical wave packet. Precise control over the spatiotemporal spin texture of light - a key requisite for synthesizing 3D optical merons - is the product of synergy between novel methodologies in the modulation of light jointly in space and time, digital holography, and large-area birefringent metasurfaces. Our work advances the fields of spin optics and topological photonics and may inspire new developments in imaging, metrology, optical communications, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>The Sensitivity Limit of Rydberg Electrometry via Fisher-Information-Optimized Slope Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the Fisher information and sensitivity of a Rydberg-atom-based microwave-field electrometer within the framework of slope detection. Instead of focusing on the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of the probe laser, we shift the analytical focus to the transmitted power response to the signal microwave to be measured. Through meticulous analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in transmitted light power, we naturally derive the desired sensitivity. Crucially, we demonstrate that laser-intrinsic noise, rather than the relaxation of the atomic system, predominantly governs the uncertainty in microwave measurement. Based on this, the Fisher information, which characterizes the precision limit of microwave measurement, is deduced. Considering only non-technical relaxation processes and excluding controllable technical relaxations, the optimal sensing conditions are numerically analyzed from the perspective of maximizing the Fisher information. The results reveal that the sensitivity of the electrometer under such conditions can reach sub-$\mathrm{nV}/(\mathrm{cm}\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}})$. Our work provides a rigorous quantitative characterization of the performance of the Rydberg-atom-based microwave-field electrometer and presents an effective strategy for optimizing its performance.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale positioning and in-situ enhancement of single G center in silicon using a fluorescence-localization technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon-based semiconductor nanofabrication technology has achieved a remarkable level of sophistication and maturity, and color centers in silicon naturally inherit this advantage. Besides, their emissions appear in telecommunication bands, which makes them play a crucial role in the construction of quantum network. To address the challenge of weak spontaneous emission, different optical cavities are fabricated to enhance the emission rate. However, the relative location between cavity and emitter is random, which greatly reduce the success probability of enhancement. Here, we report on a fluorescence-localization technique (FLT) for precisely locating single G center in silicon and embedding it in the center of a circular Bragg grating cavity in situ, achieving 240-times improvement of the success probability. We observe a 30-fold enhancement in luminescence intensity, 2.5-fold acceleration of the emission from single G center, corresponding to a Purcell factor exceeding 11. Our findings pave the way for the large-scale integration of quantum light sources including those with spins.</description>

      <title>On the relation between periodically deflected and transverse mode-locked laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse mode-locked (TML) beams exhibit high-speed beam scanning, which motivates a comparison with established beam deflection technologies, such as galvanometer and voice coil scanners. This study explores the hypothesis that TML beams can be regarded as high-speed equivalents of such periodically deflected beams. By analytically modeling the spatiotemporal properties of TML beams as well as experimentally examining periodically deflected beams, both their intensity and phase dynamics were assessed. It is shown that TML beams yield a scanning motion which is shape-invariant upon propagation and have characteristic spatiotemporal phase dynamics. While TML-like scanning in intensity can be recreated by combining periodic translational and rotational deflection, beams deflected by mirrors still exhibit different phase dynamics. These findings imply that TML beams cannot simply be categorized as high-speed variants of periodically deflected beams. Nonetheless, TML beams remain applicable to high-speed laser beam scanning, although their phase dynamics have to be considered in phase-sensitive processes.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency 2D Grating Design for the Magneto-Optical Trap: Enhancing Intensity Balance and Reducing Optical Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction gratings integrated into an atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) setup offer a compact and efficient route toward atom cooling and trapping, thus preparing magneto-optical traps (MOT) for insertion into future scalable quantum systems. Here, we propose and numerically validate a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating that satisfies the required optical conditions for laser cooling, namely, radiation pressure balance, specular reflection cancellation, and circular polarization handedness reversal upon diffraction, thus achieving an optical molasses, a necessary condition in MOT. Using Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA), we optimize the grating's geometry to maximize key figures of merit. The grating consists of a 2D square lattice of nanoholes and is designed to diffract normally incident 780 nm circularly polarized light into the four first orders, each with a diffraction efficiency of 0.24, of which 99.7% has the correct circular handedness. Our 2D diffraction grating can enhance the performance of GMOTs employing 2D gratings by improving the axial radiation pressure balance and providing a high degree of circular polarization. Furthermore, we investigated the robustness of our 2D grating to ensure high manufacturing resilience.</description>

      <title>Multi-slice beam propagation method for imaging multiple-scattering samples on reflective substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction tomography (DT) has been widely explored in transmission-mode configurations, enabling high-resolution, label-free 3D imaging. However, adapting DT for reflection-mode measurements presents significant challenges due to strong substrate reflections and complex multiple-scattering effects, particularly in metrology and industrial inspection applications. In this work, we introduce reflection-mode Fourier Ptychographic Tomography (rFPT) that achieves high-resolution, volumetric imaging of multi-layered, strongly scattering samples on reflective substrates. We develop a reflection-mode multi-slice beam propagation method (rMSBP) to model multiple scattering and substrate interactions, enabling precise 3D reconstruction. By incorporating darkfield measurements, rFPT enhances resolution beyond the traditional brightfield limit and provides sub-micrometer lateral resolution while achieving optical sectioning. We validate rFPT through numerical simulations on a four-layer resolution target and experimental demonstrations using a reflection-mode LED array microscope. Experiments on a two-layer resolution target and a multi-layer scattering sample confirm the method's effectiveness. Our optimized implementation enables rapid imaging, covering a 1.2 mm $\times$ 1.2 mm area in 1.6 seconds, reconstructing over $10^9$ voxels within a 0.4 mm$^3$ volume. This work represents a significant step in extending DT to reflection-mode configurations, providing a robust and scalable solution for 3D metrology and industrial inspection.</description>

      <title>Meta-operators for all-optical image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical image processing offers a high-speed, energy-efficient alternative to conventional electronic systems by leveraging the wave nature of light for parallel computation. However, traditional optical processors rely on bulky components, limiting scalability and integration. Here, we demonstrate a compact metasurface-based platform for analog optical computing. By employing double-phase encoding and polarization multiplexing, our approach enables arbitrary image transformations within a single passive nanophotonic device, eliminating the need for complex optical setups or digital post-processing. We experimentally showcase key computational operations, including first-order differentiation, cross-correlation, vertex detection, and Laplacian differentiation. Additionally, we extend this framework to high-resolution 3D holography, achieving subwavelength-scale volumetric wavefront control for depth-resolved reconstructions with high fidelity. Our results establish a scalable and versatile approach to computational optics, with applications including real-time image processing, energy-efficient computing, biomedical imaging, high-fidelity holographic displays, and optical data storage, driving the advancement of intelligent optical processors.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature mid-infrared detection using metasurface-absorber-integrated phononic crystal oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (MIR) detectors find extensive applications in chemical sensing, spectroscopy, communications, biomedical diagnosis and space explorations. Alternative to semiconductor MIR photodiodes and bolometers, mechanical-resonator-based MIR detectors show advantages in higher sensitivity and lower noise at room temperature, especially towards longer wavelength infrared. Here, we demonstrate uncooled room-temperature MIR detectors based on lithium niobate surface acoustic wave phononic crystal (PnC) resonators integrated with wavelength-and-polarization-selective metasurface absorber arrays. The detection is based on the resonant frequency shift induced by the local temperature change due to MIR absorptions. The PnC resonator is configured in an oscillating mode, enabling active readout and low frequency noise. Compared with detectors based on tethered thin-film mechanical resonators, our non-suspended, fully supported PnC resonators offer lower noise, faster thermal response, and robustness in both fabrication and practical applications. Our oscillator-based MIR detector shows a relative frequency noise of $5.47 \times 10^{-12}$ $\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at its oscillation frequency of 1 GHz, leading to an incident noise equivalent power of 40 $\mathrm{pW/{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}}$ for a MIR at 6 ${\mu}$m wavelength, a response time constant of 169 $\mu$s, and a large dynamic range of $10^8$ in incident MIR power. Our device architecture is compatible with the scalable manufacturing process and can be readily extended to a broader spectral range by tailoring the absorbing wavelengths of metasurface absorbers.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength plasmonic antennas based on asymmetric split-ring-resonators for high near-field enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As for plasmonic antenna structures that generate localized near-field enhancement, the most effective current implementations are based on electric dipole resonance modes, but this approach also imposes limitations on their further optimization. Here we introduce an ASRR structure whose ASR mode enables differential charge distribution across both sides of the split. Through asymmetric regulation, charges at one end can become highly localized, thereby achieving efficient near-field enhancement. The formation of this structure was initially driven by a hybrid computational framework integrating evolutionary optimization with residual neural networks, and subsequently simplified into an ASRR prototype using the Occam's Razor principle. The ASRR dimer structure can achieve an electric field intensity enhancement over 6.5 times larger than a traditional nanorod dimer, while maintaining a compact size (&lt;1/3 the working wavelength). The ASRR configuration also demonstrates superior Purcell factor and fluorescence enhancement. These results can find applications in surface-enhanced spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, and quantum light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>On-demand manipulation of superbunching emission from colloidal quantum dots and its application in noise-resistance correlated biphoton imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superbunching effect with second-order correlations larger than 2, $g^{(2)}(0)&gt;2$, indicating the N-photon bundles emission and strong correlation among photons, has a broad range of fascinating applications in quantum illumination, communication, and computation. However, the on-demand manipulation of the superbunching effect in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) under pulsed excitation, which is beneficial to integrated photonics and lab-on-a-chip quantum devices, is still challenging. Here, we disclosed the evolution of $g^{(2)}(0)$ with the parameters of colloidal QDs by Mento Carlo simulations and performed second-order correlation measurements on CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs under both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers. The photon statistics of a single colloidal QD have been substantially tailored from sub-Poissonian distribution $g^{(2)}(0) &lt;1$) to superbunching emission, with the maximum $g^{(2)}(0)$ reaching 69 and 20 under CW and pulsed excitation, respectively. We have achieved correlated biphoton imaging (CPI), employing the coincidence of the biexciton and bright exciton in one laser pulse, with the stray light and background noise up to 53 times stronger than PL emission of single colloidal QDs. By modulating the PL intensity, the Fourier-domain CPI with reasonably good contrast has been determined, with the stray light noise up to 107 times stronger than PL emission and 75600 times stronger than the counts of biphotons. Our noise-resistance CPI may enable laboratory-based quantum imaging to be applied to real-world applications with the highly desired suppression of strong background noise and stray light.</description>

Abstract: As a lens capable of sending images of deep sub-wavelength objects to the far field, the hyperlens has garnered significant attention for its super-resolution and magnification capabilities. However, traditional hyperlenses require extreme permittivity ratios and fail to achieve geometrically perfect imaging, significantly constraining their practical applications. In this paper, we introduce the general versions of hyperbolic absolute instruments from the perspective of dispersion and fundamental optical principles. These instruments enable the formation of closed orbits in geometric optics, allowing hyperlenses to achieve aberration-free, perfect imaging. This development not only provides a flexible and practical tool for enhancing the performance of traditional hyperlens, but also opens new possibilities for new optoelectronics applications based on hyperbolic ray dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological Engineering of High-Order Exceptional Points through Transformation Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian photonic systems have attracted considerable research interest due to their singular eigenvalue topology and associated anomalous physical phenomena. These properties enable diverse applications ranging from enhanced quantum metrology to chiral light-matter interactions. Practical implementation of high order EPs in optical platforms however remains fundamentally challenging, requiring precise multi-parameter control that often exceeds conventional design capabilities. This work presents a novel framework for engineering high order EPs through transformation optics (TO) principles, establishing a direct correspondence between mathematical singularities and physically controllable parameters. Our TO-based paradigm addresses critical limitations in conventional Hamiltonian approaches, where abstract parameter spaces lack explicit connections to experimentally accessible degrees of freedom, while simultaneously providing full-field mode solutions. In contrast to prevailing parity-time-symmetric architectures, our methodology eliminates symmetry constraints in EP design, significantly expanding the possibilities in non-Hermitian photonic engineering. The proposed technique enables unprecedented control over EP formation and evolution in nanophotonic systems, offering new pathways for developing topological optical devices with enhanced functionality and robustness.</description>

      <title>Enabling Highly Efficient Infrared Silicon Photodetectors via Disordered Metasurfaces with Upconversion Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photodetectors are highly desirable for their CMOS compatibility, low cost, and fast response speed. However, their application the infrared (IR) is limited by silicon's intrinsic bandgap, which restricts its detection to photons with wavelengths shorter than 1100 nm. Although several methods have been developed to extend silicon photodetectors further in the IR range, these approaches often introduce additional challenges, such as increased fabrication complexity and compatibility issues with standard CMOS processes. Here, we present an approach to overcome these limitations by integrating disordered metasurfaces with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), enabling IR detection by silicon photodetectors. The disordered design consists of hybrid Mie-plasmonic cavities, which can enhance both the near-field localization and wide-band light absorption from visible to IR, improving photocurrent conversion. Compared to ordered structures, the infrared absorption and near field of the highly disordered configuration are increased by 2.6-folds and 3.9-folds, respectively. UCNPs not only convert near-infrared photons into visible light but also enhance absorption in the mid-infrared range, thereby improving hot electron generation. The measured responsivity of the disordered element for 1550 nm laser is up to 0.22 A/W at room temperature, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 17.6%. Our design not only enhances the photocurrent performance significantly, but also extends the working wavelength of silicon photodetectors to IR wavelength, making them suitable for broad spectrum applications.</description>

      <title>On-chip GaAs carrier lifetime investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an alternative way to determine GaAs carrier lifetime using pump-probe measurement based on fibre optics and integrated waveguides. We find that our GaAs samples have the lifetime ranging from 30-80 ps, supporting the bandwidth $\geq$ 12.5 GHz. The platform utilised in this work could offer a cost-effective way to investigate photocarrier lifetime. Moreover, it may have the potential for high-speed switches and detectors, or could be exploited for possible all-optical modulation.</description>

      <title>Exceptional-point-controlled mode interaction in three-dimensional microcavities represented by generalized Husimi functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian photonics has attracted significant interest and influences several key areas such as optical metamaterials, laser physics, and nonlinear optics. While non-Hermitian effects have been widely addressed in two-dimensional systems, we focus on realistic three-dimensional devices. To this end we generalize established phase space methods from mesoscopic optics and introduce Husimi functions for three-dimensional systems that deepen the insight and access to the mode morphology and their dynamics. We illustrate that four-dimensional Husimi functions can be represented using a specific projection in two dimensions and illustrate it for (conical) cylindrical cavities. The non-Hermitian character of the intrinsically open photonic systems is in particular revealed when examining the TE and TM polarization character of the resonance modes. Unlike the 2D case, polarization is not conserved in three-dimensional cavities, and we use generalized Husimi function to represent the interaction of polarization modes. We find their dynamics to be ruled by a network of exceptional points in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index and the cavity geometry tilt angle. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cavity modes but also aids in the design of more efficient photonic devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Light-induced quantum friction of carbon nanotubes in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum friction describes the transfer of energy and momentum from electronically excited states in a material to a surrounding solvent. Here, we show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit quantum friction in water. The diffusion constants of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solution decrease linearly by around 50 % with increasing excitation power. In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces. These findings establish that excitons in SWCNTs induce quantum friction in water.</description>

      <title>Probing intensity noise in ultrafast pulses using the dispersive Fourier transform augmented by quantum sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reach the next frontier in multimode nonlinear optics, it is crucial to better understand the classical and quantum phenomena of systems with many interacting degrees of freedom -- both how they emerge and how they can be tailored to emerging applications, from multimode quantum light generation to optical computing. Soliton fission and Raman scattering comprise two such phenomena that are ideal testbeds for exploring multimode nonlinear optics, especially power-dependent physics. To fully capture the complexity of such processes, an experimental measurement technique capable of measuring shot-to-shot pulse variations is necessary. The dispersive Fourier transform (DFT) is the ideal technique to achieve this goal, using chromatic dispersion to temporally stretch an ultrafast pulse and map its spectrum onto a measurable temporal waveform. Here, we apply DFT to explore the power-dependent mean field and noise properties of soliton fission and Raman scattering. To explain quantum noise properties, the traditional approach is to perform several hundred stochastic simulations for computing statistics. In our work, we apply quantum sensitivity analysis (QSA) to compute the noise in any output observable based on fluctuations in the input pulse, all using a single backwards differentiation step. We find that the combination of DFT and QSA provides a powerful framework for understanding the quantum and classical properties of soliton fission and Raman scattering, and can be generalized to other multimode nonlinear phenomena.</description>

      <title>Ultrawide dynamic bandwidth modulation of an antiresonant nanoweb hollow-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate an acoustically modulated antiresonant nanoweb hollow-core fiber (N-HCF) for the first time. The N-HCF contains two off-center air cores with a diameter difference of 5 microns, separated by a nanoweb of silica. We analytically simulate the influence of the N-HCF core diameter, cladding wall, and nanoweb thicknesses on the confinement losses, effective indices, and beatlengths of the guided fundamental (HE11) and higher-order modes (TE01, TM01), from 750 to 1200 nm. The phase-matching of the acoustic waves and modal beatlengths is also estimated and discussed. The fabricated 3.6 cm long acousto-optic device modulates record-wide bandwidths (up to 450 nm) while providing high modulation depths (up to 8 dB) at low drive voltages (10 V). Simulated and measured results provide useful insights for designing, modeling, and characterizing the N-HCF transmission spectrum and modulation performance. These achievements lead to highly efficient, compact, and fast all-fiber sensors and modulators promising for application in pulsed fiber lasers.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of time-varying and dispersive metasurfaces with surface susceptibility operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of new fabrication technologies, time-varying metasurfaces have emerged as novel platforms for exotic waveform shaping in microwaves and optics, providing an additional degree of freedom to design dynamically controllable and reconfigurable scatterers. Nevertheless, inherent structural properties and material dispersion significantly complicates the computational analysis of such time-varying structures, highlighting the importance of efficient and intuitive analytical approaches that are generalizable to a wide class of meta-atom topologies and temporal modulation profiles. In this work, surface susceptibilities under generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs), widely used to model metasurfaces, are extended to a compact and tractable operator form for the frequency-domain analysis of metasurfaces with arbitrary temporal modulation and material dispersion. By virtue of this formalism, we derive the time-variant versions of simple surface susceptibility formulas for periodic arrays of freestanding and substrated dipolar scatterers through the use of appropriate polarizabilities. The applicability of the proposed approach to the characterization of reflective and transmissive properties of pulsed and Floquet metasurfaces is demonstrated, and verified against full-wave simulations.</description>

      <title>Energy stability of supercontinuum via femtosecond filamentation in sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy stability of supercontinuum (SC) significantly impacts its applications. To achieve the most stable SC, we systematically investigated how input pulse energy, numerical aperture (NA), and crystal thickness affect the energy stability of SC generated by femtosecond filamentation in sapphire. Our findings reveal that the SC energy does not always increase monotonically with input energy for different NA and thicknesses. This phenomenon occurs because, when the input pulse energy just exceeds the filamentation threshold, the pulse splitting structure and spectrum are still rapidly evolving. To generate a more stable SC, the numerical aperture and crystal thickness must be carefully coordinated to prevent this rapid evolution from occurring within the crystal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital holography (DH) enables non-contact, noninvasive 3D imaging of transparent and moving microscopic samples by capturing amplitude and phase information in a single shot. In this work, we present a compact, low-cost, real-time smartphone-based DHM system accelerated by GPUs. The system comprises a 3D-printed optical system using readily available image sensors and lasers, coupled with an Android app for hologram reconstruction, extracting amplitude and phase information. Results show a frame rate improvement of approximately 1.65x compared to a CPU-only system. This inexpensive, compact DHM, combining 3D-printed optics and smartphone-based reconstruction, offers a novel approach compared to existing systems and holds promise for fieldwork and remote diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Artificial Blur Effect for Optical See-through Near-Eye Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saliency modulation has significant potential for various applications. In our pursuit of implementing saliency modulation for optical see-through near-eye displays, we decided to introduce a blur effect to reduce the sharpness of specific areas while preserving the sharpness of others. In this study, we used a digital micromirror device (DMD) to separate the incoming light from a scene into sharp and blurred areas. To achieve this, we integrated an electrically tunable lens (ETL), which operates in its zero optical power mode when the reflected light from the DMD represents the sharp area (i.e., the blur area is masked). Conversely, when the reflected light indicates the blur area, the ETL adjusts to non-zero optical powers. Importantly, these modulations occur at a speed that surpasses the critical flicker frequency threshold of the human eye. Furthermore, we proposed an algorithm to mitigate the artifacts around the border area between the sharp and blur areas that are caused by the magnification of the ETL. We have also developed a prototype system to demonstrate the feasibility of our method.</description>

      <title>Generalized reciprocal diffractive imaging for stand-alone, reference-free, fast-measurable quantitative phase microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical microscopy has been employed to derive salient characteristics of an object in various fields, including cell biology, flow cytometry, biopsy, and neuroscience. In particular, measuring the phase of light scattered from an object aroused great interest by allowing retrieving quantitative parameters such as refractive index, an intrinsic property of a material. Reciprocal diffractive imaging (RDI) has succeeded in recovering the light field scattered from diffusive objects without special restrictions on illumination and sample support from a single-shot intensity in the reference-free regime. However, RDI is limited to imaging samples in the diffusive regime, making application to biological samples difficult. Here, we extend RDI to biological applications by spatially filtering the transmitted fields in the pupil plane. The proposed method is demonstrated by imaging the objects with known structures and various biological samples, showing its capability as a stand-alone optical microscope. We believe that the presented advance could be at the forefront of quantitative phase imaging due to the unique advantages the technique possesses.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution Radial Fluctuations Enables Polarization-resolved Nonlinear Optical Nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG) is a powerful imaging modality which has found applications in investigating both biological and synthetic nanostructures. Like all optical microscopy techniques, the resolution of SHG is limited to approximately half the wavelength of the excitation light. Because of this several groups have proposed techniques to enable super-resolution SHG imaging. However, these techniques often involve quite complicated optical setups compared to standard SHG microscopes, a major impediment towards more widespread utilization. Here we apply super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF), a commonly used technique for super-resolution fluorescence imaging, to enable super-resolution SHG microscopy. By imaging individual nanostructures, we demonstrate that SRRF can provide resolution enhancement of up to 3x compared to a laser scanning SHG microscope, which is comparable to the best resolution enhancement reported in the literature. Additionally, we show that SRRF maintains the polarization dependence of SHG, therefore enabling super-resolution polarization SHG imaging. Finally, we perform SRRF processing on third harmonic generation images to demonstrate the significant potential of SRRF for other super-resolution nonlinear optical microscopy. Importantly, since SRRF can achieve super-resolution purely through image processing, the technique demonstrated here could be used to enhance the resolution of images obtained using a wide variety of nonlinear optical microscopy setups including both laser scanning and widefield configurations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: Evaluation, Benchmarking and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing with undetected photons has enabled new, unconventional approaches to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Leveraging properties of non-degenerated entangled photon pairs, mid-IR information can be accessed in the near-IR spectral domain to perform mid-IR spectroscopy with silicon-based detection schemes. Here, we address practical aspects of vibrational spectroscopy with undetected photons using a quantum-FTIR (QFTIR) implementation. The system operates in the spectral range from around $3000~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to $2380~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ (detection at around $12500~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) and possesses only $68~\mathrm{pW}$ of mid-IR probing power for spectroscopic measurements with a power-dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio of $1.5\cdot 10^{5}~\mathrm{mW}^{-1/2}$. We evaluate the system's short- and long-term stability and experimentally compare it to a commercial FTIR instrument using Allan-Werle plots to benchmark our QFTIR implementation's overall performance and stability. In addition, comparative qualitative spectroscopic measurements of polymer thin films are performed using the QFTIR spectrometer and a commercial FTIR with identical resolution and integration times. Our results show under which conditions QFTIR can practically be competitive or potentially outperform conventional FTIR technology.</description>

      <title>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable N-level EIT: Deterministic Generation of Optical States with Negative Wigner Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong optical nonlinearities are key to a range of technologies, particularly in the generation of photonic quantum states. The strongest nonlinearity in hot atomic vapors originates from electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which, while effective, often lacks tunability and suffers from significant losses due to atomic absorption. We propose and demonstrate an N-level EIT scheme, created by an optical frequency comb that excites a warm rubidium vapor. The massive number of comb lines simultaneously drive numerous transitions that interfere constructively to induce a giant and highly tunable cross-Kerr optical nonlinearity. The obtained third-order nonlinearity values range from $1.2 \times 10^{-7}$ to $7.7 \times 10^{-7}$ $m^2 V^{-2}$. Above and beyond that, the collective N-level interference can be optimized by phase shaping the comb lines using a spectral phase mask. Each nonlinearity value can then be tuned over a wide range, from 40\% to 250\% of the initial strength. We utilize the nonlinearity to demonstrate squeezing by self polarization rotation of CW signals that co-propagate with the pump and are tuned to one of the EIT transparent regions. Homodyne measurements reveal a quadrature squeezing level of 3.5 dB at a detuning of 640 MHz. When tuned closer to an atomic resonance, the nonlinearity is significantly enhanced while maintaining low losses, resulting in the generation of non-Gaussian cubic phase states. These states exhibit negative regions in their Wigner functions, a hallmark of quantum behavior. Consequently, N-level EIT enables the direct generation of photonic quantum states without requiring postselection.</description>

      <title>EgoEvGesture: Gesture Recognition Based on Egocentric Event Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Egocentric gesture recognition is a pivotal technology for enhancing natural human-computer interaction, yet traditional RGB-based solutions suffer from motion blur and illumination variations in dynamic scenarios. While event cameras show distinct advantages in handling high dynamic range with ultra-low power consumption, existing RGB-based architectures face inherent limitations in processing asynchronous event streams due to their synchronous frame-based nature. Moreover, from an egocentric perspective, event cameras record data that include events generated by both head movements and hand gestures, thereby increasing the complexity of gesture recognition. To address this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for event data processing, incorporating (1) a lightweight CNN with asymmetric depthwise convolutions to reduce parameters while preserving spatiotemporal features, (2) a plug-and-play state-space model as context block that decouples head movement noise from gesture dynamics, and (3) a parameter-free Bins-Temporal Shift Module (BSTM) that shifts features along bins and temporal dimensions to fuse sparse events efficiently. We further build the EgoEvGesture dataset, the first large-scale dataset for egocentric gesture recognition using event cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 62.7% accuracy in heterogeneous testing with only 7M parameters, 3.1% higher than state-of-the-art approaches. Notable misclassifications in freestyle motions stem from high inter-personal variability and unseen test patterns differing from training data. Moreover, our approach achieved a remarkable accuracy of 96.97% on DVS128 Gesture, demonstrating strong cross-dataset generalization capability. The dataset and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/3190105222/EgoEv_Gesture.</description>

      <title>The topological spectrum of high dimensional quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology has emerged as a fundamental property of many systems, manifesting in cosmology, condensed matter, high-energy physics and waves. Despite the rich textures, the topology has largely been limited to low dimensional systems that can be characterised by a single topological number, e.g., a Chern number in matter or a Skyrme number in waves. Here, using photonic quantum states as an example, we harness the synthetic dimensions of orbital angular momentum (OAM) to discover a rich tapestry of topological maps in high dimensional spaces. Moving beyond spin textured fields, we demonstrate topologies using only one degree of freedom, the OAM of light. By interpreting the density matrix as a non-Abelian Higgs potential, we are able to predict topologies that exist as high dimensional manifolds which remarkably can be deconstructed into a multitude of simpler maps from disks to disks and spheres to spheres, giving rise to the notion of a topological spectrum rather than a topological number. We confirm this experimentally using quantum wave functions with an underlying topology of 48 dimensions and a topological spectrum spanning over 17000 maps, an encoding alphabet with enormous potential. We show that the topological spectrum allows the simultaneous ability to be robust to and probe for perturbation, the latter made possible by observing emergent signatures in the non-topological (trivial) spaces of the spectrum. Our experimental approach benefits from easy implementation, while our theoretical framework is cast in a manner that can be extrapolated to any particle type, dimension and degree of freedom. Our work opens exciting future possibilities for quantum sensing and communication with topology.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium origin of cavity-induced resonant modifications of chemical reactivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of light-matter coupling on reaction dynamics and equilibrium properties of a single molecule inside an optical cavity. The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that in both scenarios, the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned in resonance with the relevant vibrational transition, which directly leads to the formation of the corresponding product. In addition, due to the anharmonicity of chemical reactions, cavity-induced vibrational transitions within the reactant region can also influence reaction rates even when they do not directly result in product formation. However, we found that the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our proof-of-concept study highlights that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.</description>

      <title>Offset sideband locking to iodine for laser cooling on the $\mathrm{{}^1 S_0}\rightarrow \mathrm{{}^3 P_1}$ transition of ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present absolute frequency measurements of a laser stabilized using an offset sideband locking technique on the P(49)24-1 rovibrational transition of $^{127}\mathrm{I}_2$ near 556 nm. The P(49)24-1 transition is offset by 4.8 GHz from the intercombination transition of ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$. A dual-tone electro-optical modulator is employed to bridge this frequency gap, enabling frequency stabilization of the 556 nm laser near the Yb transition, achieving a fractional frequency stability of $1.2 \times 10^{-11}$ at one second. We thoroughly characterize the frequency shifts associated with this locking scheme, with typical systematic effects fractional uncertainties of $9 \times 10^{-12}$.</description>

      <title>Initial acquisition requirements for optical cavities in the space gravitational wave antennae DECIGO and B-DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DECIGO (DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) is a space-based gravitational wave antenna concept targeting the 0.1-10 Hz band. It consists of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with 1,000 km sides, forming Fabry-P\'erot cavities between them. A precursor mission, B-DECIGO, is also planned, featuring a smaller 100 km triangle. Operating these cavities requires ultra-precise formation flying, where inter-mirror distance and alignment must be precisely controlled. Achieving this necessitates a sequential improvement in precision using various sensors and actuators, from the deployment of the spacecraft to laser link acquisition and ultimately to the control of the Fabry-P\'erot cavities to maintain resonance. In this paper, we derive the precision requirements at each stage and discuss the feasibility of achieving them. We show that the relative speed between cavity mirrors must be controlled at the sub-micrometer-per-second level and that relative alignment must be maintained at the sub-microradian level to obtain control signals from the Fabry-P\'erot cavities of DECIGO and B-DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel Comb and Switch using parallel chains of non-identical Micro-Ring Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-Ring Resonators (MRRs) allow us to access the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect at a variety of tunable parameter combinations along exact analytic solutions. This higher-dimensional space of parameters for which the HOM effect occurs constitutes what is known as a Hong-Ou-Mandel manifold (HOMM). Using a parallel series of non-identical MRRs and changing relative round-trip phase shifts between MRRs allows for the manipulation of the wavelength locations of the HOM effect. Through clever design and fabrication, we can mold the HOMM to place multiple HOM effects, or lack thereof, precisely at desired locations in wavelength. In this paper we discuss how to adjust non-identical MRR parameters to change the resulting HOMM. We also promote example designs that exhibit advantageous HOMM structures, and highlight some of the diverse possibilities that can be accessed with different circuit design. Our main examples are: 1) a wavelength division multiplexer example that matches the HOM effect locations with the already established channels to integrate with a classical communication network and 2) a HOM-based entanglement switch that allows for the rapid switching between 2-photon NOON state outputs and completely separable single photon outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive optics (AO) is a powerful tool employed across various research fields, from aerospace to microscopy. Traditionally, AO has focused on correcting optical phase aberrations, with recent advances extending to polarisation compensation. However, intensity errors are also prevalent in optical systems, yet effective correction methods are still in their infancy. Here, we introduce a novel AO approach, termed intensity adaptive optics (I-AO), which employs a dual-feedback loop mechanism to first address non-uniform intensity distribution and subsequently compensate for energy loss at the pupil plane. We demonstrate that I-AO can operate in both sensor-based and sensorless formats and validate its feasibility by quantitatively analysing the focus quality of an aberrated system. This technique expands the AO toolkit, paving the way for next-generation AO technology.</description>

      <title>Ultra-narrow linewidth laser across the C-band using polarization-controlled dual-cavity feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard method to reduce the linewidth of semiconductor lasers involves the use of external optical feedback (EOF). However, feedback powers less than 1 % usually trigger coherence collapse (CC), leading to chaotic laser dynamics and linewidth broadening. This paper explores a method to mitigate CC through precise tuning of the feedback polarization depending on the feedback power. We report a semiconductor laser with a sub-100 Hz intrinsic linewidth, achieved via EOF. The laser features a U-shaped cavity with two sampled grating distributed Bragg reflectors (SG-DBRs), enabling broad tunability across a 42 nm wavelength range (1513-1555 nm). By injecting optical feedback into both sides of the laser cavity via an external fiber-based cavity, we reduce the intrinsic linewidth by more than three orders of magnitude, from MHz to sub-kHz across the laser's tuning range. By dynamically tuning the polarization, we demonstrate sub-100 Hz intrinsic linewidths at feedback powers up to 10 %, marking an improvement over prior studies where CC limited performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental investigation into the generation of self-sustained and fast square oscillations from the TE mode of semiconductor VCSELs with delayed orthogonal polarization feedback. We find that the low frequency switching originates from the rotation of the TE and TM modes facilitated by a long time delay, but the fast oscillations are anchored to the frequency beating between the TE and TM modes and are modified by a half-wavelength ($\lambda/2$) plate. A comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the nonlinear dynamics is conducted and the related mechanism is discussed. Our study not only deepens our comprehension of laser nonlinear dynamics but also offers an all-optical approach for producing specialized signals, which could be instrumental in applications such as optical communications and photonic computing leveraging the complexity of long-delay systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate magnetic permeability time-varying metamaterials at GHz frequencies using ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni80Fe20; Py). We observe frequency up and down conversion of 4 GHz microwaves through the metamaterials, which is caused by the temporal modulation of permeability in the Py layer. Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials. The present study opens a door to microwave sources toward the 6th-generation mobile communication system, four-dimensional metamaterials with spatio-temporal modulation, and nonlinear spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic intra-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable advancements across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and biology. However, the rapid expansion of AI technologies has escalated the demand for more powerful computing resources. As digital computing approaches fundamental limits, neuromorphic photonics emerges as a promising platform to complement existing digital systems. In neuromorphic photonic computing, photonic devices are controlled using analog signals. This necessitates the use of digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC) for interfacing with these devices during inference and training. However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann computing architectures consumes energy. To address this, analog memory co-located with photonic computing devices is proposed. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on DACs and minimize data movement to enhance compute efficiency. This paper demonstrates a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with co-located capacitive analog memory and analyzes analog memory specifications for neuromorphic photonic computing using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new calibration method for H-fs-TALIF is proposed, and the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections, $\sigma^{(2)}$, for atomic hydrogen (H) and krypton (Kr) is determined for the broadband emission of a femtosecond laser system. The estimated ratio of the two-photon absorption cross-sections for H and Kr is $\sigma^{(2)}$ for H and Kr $\sigma^{(2)}$(Kr)/$\sigma^{(2)}$(H) = $0.027\pm 20$%, which is nearly twenty times lower than values previously obtained with narrowband nanosecond lasers. This discrepancy highlights the need for independent calibration of TALIF measurements for a specific laser pulsewidth range.</description>

      <title>Label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy revisits intracellular thermal dynamics: what do fluorescent nanothermometers measure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescent nanothermometry has revealed pronounced inhomogeneous temperature distributions within cells and has opened the field of single-cell thermal biology. However, this finding has sparked a controversial discussion known as the 10^5 gap issue, which arises from a simple heat conduction calculation suggesting such large temperature distributions should not exist inside cells. Here, we address this issue using label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, which enables us to measure heat-induced temperature variations under local thermal equilibrium via refractive index changes. First, we measured intracellular thermal diffusivity via transient thermal decay and determined that thermal diffusivity within living cells is 93-94% of water in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This result does not support the hypothesis that intracellular thermal conduction is considerably slower than in water. Next, we compared fluorescent nanothermometry with our label-free thermometry by measuring heat-induced temperature variations in living cells and found that the fluorescent nanothermometry showed a slowly varying signal in addition to a rapidly responding temperature change. This result indicates that fluorescent nanothermometers are sensitive to additional factors beyond the temperature defined under local thermal equilibrium, which do not follow the behavior predicted by thermal conduction. From this study, we conclude that the 10^5 gap issue arises from comparing two fundamentally different physical quantities. This finding also raises an open question regarding the origin of the additional factors that fluorescence nanothermometers measure.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-Borde atom interferometry with a thermal strontium beam for a compact optical clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact optical atomic clocks have become increasingly important in field applications and clock networks. Systems based on Ramsey-Borde interferometry (RBI) with a thermal atomic beam seem promising to fill a technology gap in optical atomic clocks, as they offer higher stability than optical vapour cell clocks while being less complex than cold atomic clocks. Here, we demonstrate RBI with strontium atoms, utilizing the narrow 1S0 -&gt; 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm, yielding a 60 kHz broad spectral feature. The obtained Ramsey fringes for varying laser power are analyzed and compared with a numerical model. The 1S0 -&gt; 1P1 transition at 461 nm is used for fluorescence detection. Analyzing the slope of the RBI signal and the fluorescence detection noise yields an estimated short-term stability of 4x10-14 / sqrt{tau}. We present our experimental setup in detail, including the atomic beam source, frequency-modulation spectroscopy to lock the 461 nm laser, laser power stabilization and the high-finesse cavity pre-stabilization of the 689 nm laser. Our system serves as a ground testbed for future clock systems in mobile and space applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formulation of low-frequency scattering in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer matrix of scattering theory in one dimension can be expressed in terms of the time-evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. In particular, it admits a Dyson series expansion which turns out to facilitate the construction of the low-frequency series expansion of the scattering data. In two and three dimensions, there is a similar formulation of stationary scattering where the scattering properties of the scatterer are extracted from the evolution operator for a corresponding effective quantum system. We explore the utility of this approach to scattering theory in the study of the scattering of low-frequency time-harmonic scalar waves, $e^{-i\omega t}\psi(\mathbf{r})$, with $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ satisfying the Helmholtz equation, $[\nabla^2+k^2\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)]\psi(\mathbf{r})=0$, $\omega$ and $k$ being respectively the angular frequency and wavenumber of the incident wave, and $\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)$ denoting the relative permittivity of the carrier medium which in general takes complex values. We obtain explicit formulas for low-frequency scattering amplitude, examine their effectiveness in the study of a class of exactly solvable scattering problems, and outline their application in devising a low-frequency cloaking scheme.</description>

      <title>Engineering Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Recent developments in the generation of non-classical and entangled light states using intense laser-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-classical and entangled light states are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics and they are a powerful tool for the emergence of new quantum technologies. The development of methods that can lead to the generation of such light states is therefore of high importance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that intense laser-matter interactions can serve towards this direction. Specifically, it has been shown how the use of fully quantized approaches in intense laser-matter interactions and the process of high harmonic generation, can lead to the generation of high photon-number non-classical and entangled states from the far-infrared (IR) to the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV). Here, after a brief introduction on the fundamentals, we summarize the operation principles of these approaches and discuss the recent developments and future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong light fields with the potential application in ultrafast and quantum information science. These findings represent an important step in the development of novel quantum nonlinear spectroscopy methods, based on the interplay between the quantum properties of light and those of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Generation of Coherent Quantum Light from a Single Impurity-Bound Exciton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Impurity-bound excitons in II-VI direct-bandgap semiconductors are promising optically active solid-state spin qubits that combine exceptional optical quantum efficiency with an ultra-low spin noise environment. Previous studies on single impurities relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons. However, many quantum applications require resonant driving of quantum emitters to precisely control optical transitions and maintain coherence of the emission. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission of quantum light from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. The resonantly driven emitter exhibits bright quantum light emission that preserves the phase of the resonant drive, validated through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation enables us to directly measure the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, which indicates high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically-driven ionization process that we attribute to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We show that incoherent, low-power laser pumping efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns, recovering the resonance fluorescence emission from the bound exciton. These results pave the way for coherent optical and spin control of the single impurity states through resonant excitation of impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Polariton-induced Purcell effects via a reduced semiclassical electrodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell--Schr\"odinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. Additionally, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach -- an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using simple dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.</description>
