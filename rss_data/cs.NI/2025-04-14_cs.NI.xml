      <title>Multi-user Wireless Image Semantic Transmission over MIMO Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a typical uplink transmission scenario over multiple-input multiple-output multiple access channel (MIMO-MAC) and thus propose a multi-user learnable CSI fusion semantic communication (MU-LCFSC) framework. It incorporates CSI as the side information into both the semantic encoders and decoders to generate a proper feature mask map in order to produce a more robust attention weight distribution. Especially for the decoding end, a cooperative successive interference cancellation procedure is conducted along with a cooperative mask ratio generator, which flexibly controls the mask elements of feature mask maps. Numerical results verify the superiority of proposed MU-LCFSC compared to DeepJSCC-NOMA over 3 dB in terms of PSNR.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reinforcement Learning-based Sustainable Multi-User Computation Offloading for Mobile Edge-Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting quantum computing at the mobile edge holds immense potential for facilitating large-scale network design, processing multimodal data, optimizing resource management, and enhancing network security. In this paper, we propose a pioneering paradigm of mobile edge quantum computing (MEQC) that integrates quantum computing capabilities into classical edge computing servers that are proximate to mobile devices. To conceptualize the MEQC, we first design an MEQC system, where mobile devices can offload classical and quantum computation tasks to edge servers equipped with classical and quantum computers. We then formulate the hybrid classical-quantum computation offloading problem whose goal is to minimize system cost in terms of latency and energy consumption. To solve the offloading problem efficiently, we propose a hybrid discrete-continuous multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to learn long-term sustainable offloading and partitioning strategies. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the MEQC system cost by up to 30% compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>CICV5G: A 5G Communication Delay Dataset for PnC in Cloud-based Intelligent Connected Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-based intelligent connected vehicles (CICVs) leverage cloud computing and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) to enable efficient information exchange and cooperative control. However, communication delay is a critical factor in vehicle-cloud interactions, potentially deteriorating the planning and control (PnC) performance of CICVs. To explore whether the new generation of communication technology, 5G, can support the PnC of CICVs, we present CICV5G, a publicly available 5G communication delay dataset for the PnC of CICVs. This dataset offers real-time delay variations across diverse traffic environments, velocity, data transmission frequencies, and network conditions. It contains over 300,000 records, with each record consists of the network performance indicators (e.g., cell ID, reference signal received power, and signal-to-noise ratio) and PnC related data (e.g., position). Based on the CICV5G, we compare the performance of CICVs with that of autonomous vehicles and examine how delay impacts the PnC of CICVs. The object of this dataset is to support research in developing more accurate communication models and to provide a valuable reference for scheme development and network deployment for CICVs. To ensure that the research community can benefit from this work, our dataset and accompanying code are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>CertainSync: Rateless Set Reconciliation with Certainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set reconciliation is a fundamental task in distributed systems, particularly in blockchain networks, where it enables synchronization of transaction pools among peers and facilitates block dissemination. Traditional set reconciliation schemes are either statistical, offering success probability as a function of communication overhead and symmetric difference size, or require parametrization and estimation of that size, which can be error-prone. We present CertainSync, a novel reconciliation framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to guarantee successful set reconciliation without any parametrization or estimators. The framework is rateless and adapts to the unknown symmetric difference size. Reconciliation is guaranteed whenever the communication overhead reaches a lower bound derived from the symmetric difference size and universe size. Our framework builds on recent constructions of Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs), ensuring successful element listing as long as the number of elements is bounded. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the certainty of reconciliation for multiple constructions. Our approach is validated by simulations, showing the ability to synchronize sets with efficient communication costs while maintaining guarantees compared to baseline schemes. To further reduce overhead in large universes such as blockchain networks, CertainSync is extended with a universe reduction technique. We compare and validate this extension, UniverseReduceSync, against the basic framework using real Ethereum transaction hash data. Results show a trade-off between lower communication costs and maintaining guarantees, offering a comprehensive solution for diverse reconciliation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Target Tracking With ISAC Using EMLSR in Next-Generation IEEE 802.11 WLANs: Non-Cooperative and Cooperative Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New amendments support Wi-Fi access points (APs) and stations (STAs) in next-generation IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs). IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) features multi-link operation (MLO) with multi-link device (MLD) hosting multiple interfaces, highlighting enhanced multi-link single-radio (EMLSR) operation. IEEE 802.11bf features Wi-Fi sensing, enabling integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in Wi-Fi. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative combination of EMLSR operation and ISAC functionality, considering target tracking with ISAC using EMLSR in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. We establish a unique scenario where AP MLD needs to make ISAC decision and STA MLD selection when its interface gains a transmit opportunity (TXOP). Then, we present key design principles: ISAC decision involves the Kalman filter for target state and a developed time-based strategy for sensing/communications determination, while STA MLD selection involves a Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB)-based trilateration performance metric along with a developed candidate strategy for UL sensing and involves a developed weighted proportional fairness-aware heuristic strategy for DL communications. We propose novel non-cooperative and cooperative approaches, where each interface leverages its own information and aggregate information across all interfaces, respectively. For proposed non-cooperative and cooperative approaches, simulation results exhibit their tradeoff and superiority about sensing and communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in the Internet of Things are revolutionizing data acquisition, enhancing artificial intelligence and quality of service. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient data-gathering solution across varied environments. This paper addresses challenges in integrating UAVs for large scale data operations, including mobility, multi-hop paths, and optimized multi-source information transfer. We propose a collaborative UAV framework that enables efficient data sharing with minimal communication overhead, featuring adaptive power control and dynamic resource allocation. Formulated as an NP-hard Integer Linear Program, our approach uses heuristic algorithms to optimize routing through UAV hubs. Simulations show promise in terms of computation time (99% speedup) and outcome (down to 14% deviation from the optimal).</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Based CSI Reconstruction for Improved Wireless Security Through Channel Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reciprocity of channel state information (CSI) collected by two devices communicating over a wireless channel has been leveraged to provide security solutions to resource-limited IoT devices. Despite the extensive research that has been done on this topic, much of the focus has been on theoretical and simulation analysis. However, these security solutions face key implementation challenges, mostly pertaining to limitations of IoT hardware and variations of channel conditions, limiting their practical adoption. To address this research gap, we revisit the channel reciprocity assumption from an experimental standpoint using resource-constrained devices. Our experimental study reveals a significant degradation in channel reciprocity for low-cost devices due to the varying channel conditions. Through experimental investigations, we first identify key practical causes for the degraded channel reciprocity. We then propose a new wavelet-based CSI reconstruction technique using wavelet coherence and time-lagged cross-correlation to construct CSI data that are consistent between the two participating devices, resulting in significant improvement in channel reciprocity. Additionally, we propose a secret-key generation scheme that exploits the wavelet-based CSI reconstruction, yielding significant increase in the key generation rates. Finally, we propose a technique that exploits CSI temporal variations to enhance device authentication resiliency through effective detection of replay attacks.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Cloud Management Plane for Data Processing Pipelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As organizations increasingly rely on data-driven insights, the ability to run data intensive applications seamlessly across multiple cloud environments becomes critical for tapping into cloud innovations while complying with various security and regulatory requirements. However, big data application development and deployment remain challenging to accomplish in such environments. With the increasing containerization and modernization of big data applications, we argue that a unified control/management plane now makes sense for running these applications in hybrid cloud environments. To this end, we study the problem of building a generic hybrid-cloud management plane to radically simplify managing big data applications. A generic architecture for hybrid-cloud management, called Titchener, is proposed in this paper. Titchener comprises of independent and loosely coupled local control planes interacting with a highly available public cloud hosted global management plane. We describe a possible instantiation of Titchener based on Kubernetes and address issues related to global service discovery, network connectivity and access control enforcement. We also validate our proposed designs with a real management plane implementation based on a popular big data workflow orchestration in hybrid-cloud environments.</description>

      <title>Jupiter: Fast and Resource-Efficient Collaborative Inference of Generative LLMs on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional capabilities in various AI tasks. Traditionally deployed in cloud datacenters, LLMs are now increasingly moving towards more accessible edge platforms to protect sensitive user data and ensure privacy preservation. The limited computational resources of individual edge devices, however, can result in excessively prolonged inference latency and overwhelmed memory usage. While existing research has explored collaborative edge computing to break the resource wall of individual devices, these solutions yet suffer from massive communication overhead and under-utilization of edge resources. Furthermore, they focus exclusively on optimizing the prefill phase, neglecting the crucial autoregressive decoding phase for generative LLMs. To address that, we propose Jupiter, a fast, scalable, and resource-efficient collaborative edge AI system for generative LLM inference. Jupiter introduces a flexible pipelined architecture as a principle and differentiates its system design according to the differentiated characteristics of the prefill and decoding phases. For prefill phase, Jupiter submits a novel intra-sequence pipeline parallelism and develops a meticulous parallelism planning strategy to maximize resource efficiency; For decoding, Jupiter devises an effective outline-based pipeline parallel decoding mechanism combined with speculative decoding, which further magnifies inference acceleration. Extensive evaluation based on realistic implementation demonstrates that Jupiter remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various edge environment setups, achieving up to 26.1x end-to-end latency reduction while rendering on-par generation quality.</description>

      <title>Online SLA Decomposition: Enabling Real-Time Adaptation to Evolving Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08968v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a network slice spans multiple technology domains, it is crucial for each domain to uphold the End-to-End (E2E) Service Level Agreement (SLA) associated with the slice. Consequently, the E2E SLA must be properly decomposed into partial SLAs that are assigned to each domain involved. In a network slice management system with a two-level architecture, comprising an E2E service orchestrator and local domain controllers, we consider that the orchestrator has access only to historical data regarding the responses of local controllers to previous requests, and this information is used to construct a risk model for each domain. In this study, we extend our previous work by investigating the dynamic nature of real-world systems and introducing an online learning-decomposition framework to tackle the dynamicity. We propose a framework that continuously updates the risk models based on the most recent feedback. This approach leverages key components such as online gradient descent and FIFO memory buffers, which enhance the stability and robustness of the overall process. Our empirical study on an analytic model-based simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art static approach, delivering more accurate and resilient SLA decomposition under varying conditions and data limitations. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive complexity analysis of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>A$^3$L-FEC: Age-Aware Application Layer Forward Error Correction Flow Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) is a metric and KPI that has been developed for measuring and controlling data freshness. Optimization of AoI in a real-life network requires adapting the rate and timing of transmissions to varying network conditions. The vast majority of previous research on the control of AoI has been theoretical, using idealized models that ignored certain implementation aspects. As such, there is still a gap between the research on AoI and real-world protocols. In this paper we present an effort toward closing this gap by introducing an age-aware flow control algorithm. The algorithm, Age-Aware Application Layer Forward Error Correction (A$^3$L-FEC), is a packet generation mechanism operating on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The purpose is to control the peak Age of the end-to-end packet flow, specifically to reduce the rate of so-called "Age Violations," i.e., events where the peak age exceeds a given threshold. Evaluations in Mininet-WiFi and MATLAB indicate that A$3$L-FEC reduces age violations compared to two related protocols in the literature, namely TCP-BBR and ACP+.</description>

      <title>RAILS: Risk-Aware Iterated Local Search for Joint SLA Decomposition and Service Provider Management in Multi-Domain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of the fifth generation (5G) technology has transformed mobile networks into multi-service environments, necessitating efficient network slicing to meet diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs). SLA decomposition across multiple network domains, each potentially managed by different service providers, poses a significant challenge due to limited visibility into real-time underlying domain conditions. This paper introduces Risk-Aware Iterated Local Search (RAILS), a novel risk model-driven meta-heuristic framework designed to jointly address SLA decomposition and service provider selection in multi-domain networks. By integrating online risk modeling with iterated local search principles, RAILS effectively navigates the complex optimization landscape, utilizing historical feedback from domain controllers. We formulate the joint problem as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and prove its NP-hardness. Extensive simulations demonstrate that RAILS achieves near-optimal performance, offering an efficient, real-time solution for adaptive SLA management in modern multi-domain networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models such as LLMs, GPTs, and Diffusion Models have recently gained widespread attention from both the research and the industrial communities. This survey explores their application in network monitoring and management, focusing on prominent use cases, as well as challenges and opportunities. We discuss how network traffic generation and classification, network intrusion detection, networked system log analysis, and network digital assistance can benefit from the use of GenAI models. Additionally, we provide an overview of the available GenAI models, datasets for large-scale training phases, and platforms for the development of such models. Finally, we discuss research directions that potentially mitigate the roadblocks to the adoption of GenAI for network monitoring and management. Our investigation aims to map the current landscape and pave the way for future research in leveraging GenAI for network monitoring and management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future surgical care demands real-time, integrated data to drive informed decision-making and improve patient outcomes. The pressing need for seamless and efficient data capture in the OR motivates our development of a modular solution that bridges the gap between emerging machine learning techniques and interventional medicine. We introduce a network of edge devices, called Data Hubs (DHs), that interconnect diverse medical sensors, imaging systems, and robotic tools via optical fiber and a centralized network switch. Built on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, each DH supports multiple interfaces (HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet) and encapsulates device-specific drivers within Docker containers using the Isaac ROS framework and ROS2. A centralized user interface enables straightforward configuration and real-time monitoring, while an Nvidia DGX computer provides state-of-the-art data processing and storage. We validate our approach through an ultrasound-based 3D anatomical reconstruction experiment that combines medical imaging, pose tracking, and RGB-D data acquisition.</description>
