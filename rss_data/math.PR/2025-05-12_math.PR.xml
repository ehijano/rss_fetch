      <title>Convergence from the Log-Gamma Polymer to the Directed Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the log-gamma sheet and the log-gamma landscape in terms of the 2-parameter and 4-parameter free energy of the log-gamma polymer model and prove that they converge to the Airy sheet and the directed landscape, which are central objects in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Our proof of convergence to the Airy sheet relies on the invariance of free energy through the geometric RSK correspondence and the monotonicity of the free energy. To upgrade the convergence to the directed landscape, tail bounds in both spatial and temporal directions are required. However, due to the lack of scaling invariance in the discrete log-gamma polymer--unlike the Brownian setting of the O'Connell-Yor model--existing on-diagonal fluctuation bounds are insufficient. We therefore develop new off-diagonal local fluctuation estimates for the log-gamma polymer.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for step reinforced random walks with regularly varying memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a generalized step reinforced random walk, starting from the origin, the first step is taken according to the first element of an innovation sequence. Then in subsequent epochs, it recalls a past epoch with probability proportional to a regularly varying sequence $\{\mu_n\}$ of index $\gamma&gt;-1$; recalls and repeats the step taken with probability $p$, or with probability $1-p$ takes a fresh step from the innovation sequence. The innovation sequence is assumed to be i.i.d.\ with mean zero. We study the corresponding step reinforced random walk process with linearly scaled time as an r.c.l.l.\ function on $[0, \infty)$. We prove law of large numbers for the linearly scaled process almost surely and in $L^1$ for all possible values of $p$ and $\gamma$.
  Assuming finite second moments for the innovation sequence, we obtain interesting phase transitions based on the boundedness of a sequence associated with $\{\mu_n\}$. The random walk suitably scaled converges almost surely to a process, which may not be Gaussian, when the sequence is bounded and the convergence is in distribution to a Gaussian process otherwise. This phase transition introduces the point of criticality at $p_c=\frac{\gamma+1/2}{\gamma+1}$ for $\gamma&gt;-\frac12$. For the subcritical regime, the process is diffusive, while it is superdiffusive otherwise. However, for the critical regime, the scaled process can converge almost surely or in distribution depending on the choice of sequence $\{\mu_n\}$. Almost sure convergence in the critical regime is new. In the critical regime, the scaling can include many more novel choices in addition to $\sqrt{n \log n}$. Further, we use linear time scale and time independent scales even for the critical regime. We argue the exponential time scale for the critical regime is not natural. All the convergences in all the regimes are obtained for the process as an r.c.l.l.\ function.</description>

      <title>Free positive multiplicative Brownian motion and the free additive convolution of semicircle and uniform distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free positive multiplicative Brownian motion $(h_t)_{t\geq0}$ is the large $N$ limit in non-commutative distribution of matrix geometric Brownian motion. It can be constructed by setting $h_t:=g_{t/2}g_{t/2}^*$, where $(g_t)_{t\geq0}$ is a free multiplicative Brownian motion, which is the large $N$ limit in non-commutative distribution of the Brownian motion in $\operatorname{Gl}(N,\mathbb{C})$. One key property of $(h_t)_{t\geq0}$ is the fact that the corresponding spectral distributions $(\nu_t)_{t\geq0}\subset M^1((0,\infty))$ form a semigroup w.r.t. free multiplicative convolution. In recent work by M. Voit and the present author, it was shown that $\nu_t$ can be expressed by the image measure of a free additive convolution of the semicircle and the uniform distribution on an interval under the exponential map. In this paper, we provide a new proof of this result by calculating the moments of the free additive convolution of semicircle and uniform distributions on intervals. As a by-product, we also obtain new integral formulas for $\nu_t$ which generalize the corresponding known moment formulas involving Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <title>Top of the spectrum of discrete Anderson Hamiltonians with correlated Gaussian potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the top of the spectrum of discrete Anderson Hamiltonians with correlated Gaussian noise in the large volume limit. The class of Gaussian noises under consideration allows for long-range correlations. We show that the largest eigenvalues converge to a Poisson point process and we obtain a very precise description of the associated eigenfunctions near their localisation centres. We also relate these localisation centres with the locations of the maxima of the noise. Actually, our analysis reveals that this relationship depends in a subtle way on the behaviour near $0$ of the covariance function of the noise: in some situations, the largest eigenfunctions are not associated with the largest values of the noise.</description>

      <title>Approximations for the number of maxima and near-maxima in independent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting where we have $n$ independent observations of a random variable $X$, we derive explicit error bounds in total variation distance when approximating the number of observations equal to the maximum of the sample (in the case where $X$ is discrete) or the number of observations within a given distance of an order statistic of the sample (in the case where $X$ is absolutely continuous). The logarithmic and Poisson distributions are used as approximations in the discrete case, with proofs which include the development of Stein's method for a logarithmic target distribution. In the absolutely continuous case our approximations are by the negative binomial distribution, and are established by considering negative binomial approximation for mixed binomials. The cases where $X$ is geometric, Gumbel and uniform are used as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Preferential Attachment Trees with Vertex Death: Persistence of the Maximum Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an evolving random discrete tree model called Preferential Attachment with Vertex Death, as introduced by Deijfen. Initialised with an alive root labelled $1$, at each step $n\geq1$ either a new vertex with label $n+1$ is introduced that attaches to an existing alive vertex selected preferentially according to a function $b$, or an alive vertex is selected preferentially according to a function $d$ and killed. In this article we introduce a generalised concept of persistence for evolving random graph models. Let $O_n$ be the smallest label among all alive vertices (the oldest alive vertex), and let $I_n^m$ be the label of the alive vertex with the $m^{\mathrm{th}}$ largest degree. We say a persistent $m$-hub exists if $I_n^m$ converges almost surely, we say that persistence occurs when $I_n^1/O_n$ is tight, and that lack of persistence occurs when $I_n^1/O_n$ tends to infinity. We identify two regimes called the infinite lifetime and finite lifetime regimes. In the infinite lifetime regime, vertices are never killed with positive probability. Here, we provide conditions under which we prove the (non-)existence of persistent $m$-hubs for any $m\in\mathbb N$. This expands and generalises recent work of Iyer, which covers the case $d\equiv 0$ and $m=1$. In the finite lifetime regime, vertices are killed after a finite number of steps almost surely. Here we provide conditions under which we prove the occurrence of persistence, which complements recent work of Heydenreich and the author, where lack of persistence is studied for preferential attachment with vertex death.</description>

      <title>Random currents for signed interactions in the one-dimensional heterogeneous Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random current representation has been very successful in analyzing the ferromagnetic Ising model. In this article, we extend the method to the non-ferromagnetic case. To show its usefulness, we derive a covariance identity for the heterogeneous one-dimensional Ising model, which recovers the correct rate of exponential decay of covariances in the case of random i.i.d. interaction and external field.</description>

      <title>A Feedback Control Framework for Incentivised Suburban Parking Utilisation and Urban Core Traffic Relief</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, exacerbated by inefficient parking management and cruising for parking, significantly hampers mobility and sustainability in smart cities. Drivers often face delays searching for parking spaces, influenced by factors such as accessibility, cost, distance, and available services such as charging facilities in the case of electric vehicles. These inefficiencies contribute to increased urban congestion, fuel consumption, and environmental impact. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a feedback control incentivisation-based system that aims to better distribute vehicles between city and suburban parking facilities offering park-and-charge/-ride services. Individual driver behaviours are captured via discrete choice models incorporating factors of importance to parking location choice among drivers, such as distance to work, public transport connectivity, charging infrastructure availability, and amount of incentive offered; and are regulated through principles of ergodic control theory. The proposed framework is applied to an electric vehicle park-and-charge/-ride problem, and demonstrates how predictable long-term behaviour of the system can be guaranteed.</description>

      <title>On the structure of complex spectra and eigenfunctions of transfer and Koopman operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex spectra of transfer and Koopman operators describe rotational motion in dynamical systems. A particularly relevant situation in applications is where the rotation speed depends on the position in the phase space. We consider a canonical model of such dynamics in the presence of small noise, and provide precise characterisations of the eigenspectrum and eigenfunctions of the corresponding transfer operators. Further, we study the limiting behaviour of the eigenspectrum and eigenfunctions in the zero-noise limit, including their quadratic and linear response. Our results clarify the structure of transfer and Koopman operator eigenspectra, and provide new interpretations for applications. Our theorems on support localisation of the eigenfunctions yield simple algorithms to detect the existence and phase-space location of approximately cyclic motion with distinct periods. Our response results demonstrate that information on the cycle periods and their locations determined by the operator eigendata is largely insensitive to the noise level. We believe the mechanisms creating the eigendata apply more broadly and enhance our understanding of approximate cycle detection in dynamical systems with operator methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness of a nonlinear reaction diffusion partial differential equation system on the half-line coupled with a stochastic dynamical boundary condition, a random system arising from the description of the chemical reaction of sulphur dioxide with calcium carbonate stones. The boundary condition is given by a Jacobi process, solution to a stochastic differential equation with a mean-reverting drift and a bounded diffusion coefficient. The main result is the global existence and the pathwise uniqueness of mild solutions. The proof relies on a splitting strategy, which allows to deal with the low regularity of the dynamical boundary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of majority dynamics with more than two states on the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$. In this process, each vertex has a state in $\{1,\ldots, k\}$, with $k\geq 3$, and at each round every vertex adopts state $i$ if it has more neighbours in state $i$ that in any other state. Ties are resolved randomly. We show that with high probability the process reaches unanimity in at most three rounds, if $np\gg n^{2/3}$.</description>

      <title>A Test of a Conjecture of Cardy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reference to Werner's measure on self-avoiding loops on Riemann surfaces, Cardy conjectured a formula for the measure of all homotopically nontrivial loops in a finite type annular region with modular parameter $\rho$. Ang, Remy and Sun have announced a proof of this conjecture using random conformal geometry. Cardy's formula implies that the measure of the set of homotopically nontrivial loops in the punctured plane which intersect $S^1$ equals $\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}}$. This set is the disjoint union of the set of loops which avoid a ray from the unit circle to infinity and its complement. There is an inclusion/exclusion sum which, in a limit, calculates the measure of the set of loops which avoid a ray. Each term in the sum involves finding the transfinite diameter of a slit domain. This is numerically accessible using the remarkable Schwarz-Christoffel package developed by Driscoll and Trefethen. Our calculations suggest this sum is around $\pi$, consistent with Cardy's formula.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of planar maps with large faces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that large Boltzmann stable planar maps of index $\alpha \in (1;2)$ converge in the scaling limit towards a random compact metric space $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$ that we construct explicitly. They form a one-parameter family of random continuous spaces ``with holes'' or ``faces'' different from the Brownian sphere. In the so-called dilute phase $\alpha \in [3/2;2)$, the topology of $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$ is that of the Sierpinski carpet, while in the dense phase $\alpha \in (1;3/2)$ the ``faces'' of $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$ may touch each-others. En route, we prove various geometric properties of these objects concerning their faces or the behavior of geodesics.</description>

      <title>A New Proof of Sub-Gaussian Norm Concentration Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method for proving the norm concentration inequality of sub-Gaussian variables. Our proof is based on an averaged version of the moment generating function, termed the averaged moment generating function. Our method applies to both vector cases to bound the vector norm and matrix cases to bound the operator norm. Compared with the widely adopted $\varepsilon$-net technique-based proof of the sub-Gaussian norm concentration inequality, our method does not rely on the union bound and promises a tighter concentration bound.</description>

      <title>On expected signatures and signature cumulants in semimartingale models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05085</link>

Abstract: The concept of signatures and expected signatures is vital in data science, especially for sequential data analysis. The signature transform, a Cartan type development, translates paths into high-dimensional feature vectors, capturing their intrinsic characteristics. Under natural conditions, the expectation of the signature determines the law of the signature, providing a statistical summary of the data distribution. This property facilitates robust modeling and inference in machine learning and stochastic processes. Building on previous work by the present authors [Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus expansions, FoM Sigma '22] we here revisit the actual computation of expected signatures, in a general semimartingale setting. Several new formulae are given. A log-transform of (expected) signatures leads to log-signatures (signature cumulants), offering a significant reduction in complexity.</description>

      <title>Thinning-Stable Point Processes as a Model for Spatial Burstiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern telecommunications, spatial burstiness of data traffic
  poses challenges to traditional Poisson-based models. This paper
  describes application of thinning-stable point processes,
  which provide a more appropriate framework for modeling bursty
  spatial data. We discuss their properties, representation, inference
  methods, and applications, demonstrating the advantages over
  classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Loss-Versus-Rebalancing under Deterministic and Generalized block-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although modern blockchains almost universally produce blocks at fixed intervals, existing models still lack an analytical formula for the loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) incurred by Automated Market Makers (AMMs) liquidity providers in this setting. Leveraging tools from random walk theory, we derive the following closed-form approximation for the per block per unit of liquidity expected LVR under constant block time:
  \[ \overline{\mathrm{ARB}}= \frac{\,\sigma_b^{2}} {\,2+\sqrt{2\pi}\,\gamma/(|\zeta(1/2)|\,\sigma_b)\,}+O\!\bigl(e^{-\mathrm{const}\tfrac{\gamma}{\sigma_b}}\bigr)\;\approx\; \frac{\sigma_b^{2}}{\,2 + 1.7164\,\gamma/\sigma_b}, \] where $\sigma_b$ is the intra-block asset volatility, $\gamma$ the AMM spread and $\zeta$ the Riemann Zeta function. Our large Monte Carlo simulations show that this formula is in fact quasi-exact across practical parameter ranges.
  Extending our analysis to arbitrary block-time distributions as well, we demonstrate both that--under every admissible inter-block law--the probability that a block carries an arbitrage trade converges to a universal limit, and that only constant block spacing attains the asymptotically minimal LVR. This shows that constant block intervals provide the best possible protection against arbitrage for liquidity providers.</description>
