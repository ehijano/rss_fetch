      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh effective theory of charge transport: redundancies and systematic $\omega/T$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories (EFTs) for systems with non-Abelian internal symmetries near thermal equilibrium. We consider two approaches that were put forward in the literature -- one using a redundant Goldstone parameterization, the other employing an adjoint matter field -- and demonstrate their complete equivalence by providing an explicit dictionary and proving their equivalence at the path integral level. Critically, we extend both formalisms to be compatible with the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (DKMS) symmetry to all orders in $\hbar \omega /T$, classifying all possible invariant kernels satisfying unitarity constraints. We also establish precise power-counting rules, clarifying the interplay between the semiclassical and hydrodynamic expansions. Our work provides a framework for studying non-Abelian charge transport and fluctuations to arbitrary orders in $\hbar \omega /T$.</description>

      <title>Driven inhomogeneous CFT as a theory in curved space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two-dimensional conformal field theories driven by evolving background space-time metrics in a closed universe, we present an operator formulation as a driven inhomogeneous CFT. The Hamiltonian of this theory is given by a background space-time dependent smearing of the stress tensor over the spatial slice. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of the curved-space Weyl anomaly, which we show is realized by the difference between Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg picture Hamiltonians once an appropriate renormalization scheme, the chirally split scheme, is chosen. As a result, the unitary evolution generated by the background metric coincides with that of a Virasoro quantum circuit. To showcase our formalism, we consider the stress tensor one-point function and the entanglement entropy of an interval in both operator and curved-space formulations. We find that these curved-space observables admit a state interpretation only in the chirally split scheme. Finally, we derive the holographic dual of the driven CFT in three-dimensional gravity, extending previous works to arbitrary driving. The holographic dictionary reproduces the stress tensor one-point function and the entanglement entropy in a diffeomorphism invariant scheme.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Long-Range Forces in De Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation theory of de Sitter space admits partially massless (PM) particles, but whether such particles can participate in consistent interacting theories remains unclear. We investigate the consistency of theories containing PM fields, particularly when these fields are coupled to gravity. Our strategy exploits the fact that PM fields correspond to partially conserved currents on the spacetime boundary, which generate symmetries. These symmetries place stringent constraints on correlation functions of charged operators, allowing us to test the consistency of a proposed bulk spectrum. When the assumed operator content violates these constraints, the corresponding bulk theory is ruled out. Applying this framework, we show that, in four-dimensional de Sitter space, PM fields of spin 2 or 3 (at depth 0) cannot couple consistently to gravity: such couplings necessitate additional massive fields, which are inevitably non-unitary. In higher dimensions, however, the constraints can be satisfied without violating unitarity if further PM fields are included. The resulting structure leads to additional charge conservation laws, which suggests that consistency may ultimately require an infinite tower of higher-spin PM fields, akin to the situation for ordinary higher-spin symmetries. The methods developed here provide powerful constraints on possible long-range interactions in de Sitter space and delineate the landscape of consistent quantum field theories in cosmological spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.</description>

      <title>New Crosscap States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate crosscap states in two-dimensional rational conformal field theories (RCFTs), with an emphasis on the role of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, we argue for the existence of crosscap states labelled by each Verlinde line in the RCFT, extending previous constructions involving simple currents. Evidence for the existence of these new states is obtained by deriving a generalized Cardy condition incorporating both crosscaps and topological defects, which we check in some concrete examples. Finally, we briefly discuss how these crosscap states transform under the action of Verlinde lines, as well as the connection to mixed anomalies between parity and internal symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Boundary of Symmetric Moduli Spaces and the Swampland Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For non-compact, locally symmetric moduli spaces M, the set of geodesics and the geometry of the boundary can be completely characterised using group theory. In particular, geodesics that asymptote to a given infinite distance boundary point are characterised by a choice of rational parabolic subgroup P(Q) of the local isometry group G and an element of the Cartan subalgebra of P(Q). Under the assumption that M satisfies the "compactifiability" constraint of arXiv:2412.03640 and some mild conditions on the spectrum of states, we use this formalism to prove the Swampland Distance Conjecture for essentially all locally symmetric spaces M. We show that the states necessarily transform in some representation of G, and further that the convex hull encoding the exponential rate at which the leading tower of states becomes light is simply the convex hull of the weights of the representation. In a companion paper, we then use the formalism to classify all locally symmetric spaces and irreducible representations that are consistent with the Emergent String Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Full twists and stability of knots and quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate the stability of knot invariants under twisting a pair of strands to the stability of symmetric quivers under unlinking (or linking) operation. Starting from the HOMFLY-PT skein relations, we confirm the stable growth of $Sym^r$-coloured HOMFLY-PT polynomials under the addition of a~full twist to the knot. On the other hand, we show that symmetric quivers exhibit analogous stable growth under unlinking or linking of the quiver augmented with the extra node; in some cases this augmented quiver captures the spectrum of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of all quivers in the sequence. Combining these two versions of the stable growth, we conjecture that performing a~full twist on any knot corresponds to appropriate unlinking or linking of the corresponding augmented quiver -- this statement is an important step towards a~direct definition of the knot-quiver correspondence based on the knot diagram. We confirm the conjecture for all twist knots, $(2,2p+1)$ torus knots, and all pretzel knots up to 15 crossings with an~odd number of twists in each twist region.</description>

      <title>Axions, Three-Forms, and M-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar fields with masses protected by global shift symmetries, commonly referred to as axions, are abundantly used in effective field theories in cosmology and particle physics. However, global symmetries cannot be expected to be protected at the fundamental level. Finding consistent ultra-violet completions for axions is therefore a necessity. In this work, we identify the axion with the position mode of a charged 3-brane in (4+1)-dimensions. The shift symmetry of the axion is then a residual diffeomorphism in the fifth dimension orthogonal to the brane. Meanwhile, the brane is coupled to a flux in the fifth dimension. From the (3+1)-dimensional perspective, this construction generates a mass for the axion and matches previously known proposals in the literature based on the coupling between the axion and a three-form gauge field. In a second step, we uplift this (4+1)-dimensional model to M-theory, where the same three-form is found to couple to the membrane with a (2+1)-dimensional worldvolume. In particular, our proposal also elucidates the duality between the axion and a two-form gauge field in the literature. We show that this dual two-form couples to the boundary of an open membrane in M-theory. Finally, we comment on the relations to and differences from other closed and open string axion monodromy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new definition of the trace-map bordism within the Atiyah-Segal framework for Witten-type TQFTs constructed from the topological twist of mass-gapped theories. We demonstrate that these Witten-type TQFTs are unitary under this revised definition and conjecture the self-consistency of the modified bordism category.</description>

      <title>Higher-spins on Taub-NUT and higher-spin Taub-NUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider higher-spin extensions of self-dual Yang-Mills (HS-SDYM) and self-dual Gravity (HS-SDGR), which are also truncations of chiral higher-spin gravity. Higher-spin fields can consistently propagate on gravitational instantons and we construct solutions to the higher-spin equations on the Taub-NUT background. We show that these solutions remain exact solutions of HS-SDYM. For HS-SDGR the perturbation theory converges for any given spin to give a higher-spin generalization of Taub-NUT and we identify a commutative non-associative algebra that governs the structure of the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Bit Threads: From Entanglement to Geometric Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we attempt to construct bit threads configurations for various backgrounds using expressions from CPS formalism. We find that when the Ryu-Takayanagi surface is same as horizon, such expressions are sufficient. In other cases, it differs by gradient of a harmonic function. We explore its relation to Wald and differential entropy, and re-express the first law of entanglement entropy in terms of bit threads. Inclusion of quantum effects imposes some constraints on the bulk entanglement via the dominant energy condition. We also apply our method to ascertain bit thread configuration in certain dynamical spacetime.</description>

      <title>The GINN framework: a stochastic QED correspondence for stability and chaos in deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1) symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel, propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in stochastic QED and wide DNNs.</description>

      <title>Resurgence for large $c$ expansion in Coulomb gas formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a resurgence analysis for large central charge (large $C$) expansions in two-dimensional CFTs using the Coulomb gas formalism. Through the exact Borel-Laplace representations of the conformal blocks $I_1(C,z)$ and $I_2(C,z)$ associated with the four-point correlation function $ \langle \phi_{2,1}(0)\phi_{2,1}(z,\bar{z})\phi_{2,1}(1)\phi_{2,1}(\infty)\rangle$, we demonstrate that $I_1(C,z)$ participates in the Stokes phenomenon of $I_2(C,z)$ (and vice versa), and establish that monodromy in $z$ arises from alien calculus in the Borel plane variable $\zeta$ (Borel dual to $C$). From a given conformal block, resurgence theory thus enables us to discover other internal operators (conformal blocks). This approach establishes a non-perturbative connection between conformal blocks, shedding light on the resurgence phenomena in more general quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Free Quotients of CICYs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free quotients of Calabi-Yau manifolds play an important role in string compactification. In this paper, we explore machine learning techniques, such as fully connected neural networks and multi-head attention (MHA) models, as a potential approach to detect $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ free quotients of CICYs. When tested on unseen examples, both models successfully identified almost all free quotients for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. These results demonstrate that well-trained machine learning models can effectively generalize to new Calabi-Yau manifolds and may aid in the broader classification of free quotients in the future.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence in Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the recursion method applied to a generic 2pt function of a quantum system and show, in full generality, that the temperature dependence of the corresponding Lanczos coefficients is governed by integrable dynamics. After an appropriate change of variables, Lanczos coefficients with even and odd indices are described by two independent Toda chains, related at the level of the initial conditions. Consistency of the resulting equations can be used to show that certain scale-invariant models necessarily have a degenerate spectrum. We dub this self-consistency-based approach the ''Krylov bootstrap''. The known analytic behavior of the Toda chain at late times translates into analytic control over the 2pt function and Krylov complexity at very low temperatures. We also discuss the behavior of Lanczos coefficients when the temperature is low but not much smaller than the spectral gap, and elucidate the origin of the staggering behavior of Lanczos coefficients in this regime.</description>

      <title>The on-shell action of supergravity &amp; the B-side of TsT and single-trace $T\bar T$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose boundary terms for the action of the NS sector of supergravity on $M_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ spacetimes -- where $M_3$ is an AdS$_3$ or a linear dilaton background -- that render the Brown-York stress tensor and the on-shell action finite. For AdS$_3$ backgrounds, we show that the on-shell action yields a free energy with chemical potentials determined by the $B$-field. TsT (T-duality + shift + T-duality) transformations of these backgrounds generate classes of linear dilaton backgrounds distinguished by their boundary conditions. Among them, there is one class of backgrounds that reproduces features of the single-trace $T\bar T$ deformation. These backgrounds have additional chemical potentials that can be turned off by large gauge transformations of the $B$-field. We show that the Brown-York stress tensor of these backgrounds reproduces the energies and the trace flow equation of $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs. We also show that the on-shell action matches the $T\bar T$ partition function and discuss the interpretation of these results.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operator describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>

      <title>ER = EPR in Loop Quantum Gravity: the Immirzi Parameter and the Continuum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recast the finite-region analysis of Einstein's equations that underpins the ER=EPR program into the loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework. By translating curvature-energy uncertainty relations into holonomy-flux kinematics, and by identifying Planckian Einstein-Rosen throats with single-puncture cuts through spin networks, we obtain a precise dictionary between entanglement and quantum geometry. Within this dictionary we derive the Barbero-Immirzi parameter directly from the entanglement/area increment of a minimal bridge, and show that a boundary edge-mode construction renders the Bekenstein - Hawking entropy coefficient universal and independent of $\gamma$ under a natural complex polarization. We further establish a refinement renormalization flow for spin-foam amplitudes driven by the finite-region curvature energy bound, which suppresses bubble divergences and yields a regulator-independent continuum limit under explicit conditions. Finally, we indicate observational consequences that follow from an $N$-party generalized uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>The Stationary Klein-Gordon Equation with a Delta-like Source: A Generalized Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to initiate a discussion on finding solutions to non-homoge\-neous differential equations in terms of generalized functions. For simplicity, we conduct the analysis within the specific context of the stationary Klein-Gordon equation with a point-like source, identifying a generalized function that solves such an equation and aligns with the solution obtained through the Fourier approach with dimensional regularization. In addition to being regular at the source singularity, a notable advantage of our solution is its presentation as a single expression, eliminating the need for piecewise definitions. The arguments presented here are applicable to a broader range of situations, offering a novel approach to addressing divergences in field theories using generalized functions. Moreover, we anticipate that the approach introduced in this work could provide a new method for handling Green functions regularized at coincident points, thereby simplifying the renorma\-lization process in a wide range of theories.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields from nonlinear sigma models on black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields with non-trivial kinetic term derived from a nonlinear sigma model are motivated by UV completions of gravity such as string theory. We discuss the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{O}(3)$ sigma models with interacting potentials and simulate their full nonlinear dynamics on black hole spacetimes. We study the properties of the field as a function of the curvature of the sigma model with respect to the free massive scalar case. In the accretion process, the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ model behaves as a self-interacting field with attractive interaction, while the $\mathrm{O}(3)$ one exhibits a repulsive phenomenology. In the case of a binary black hole system, these models cause a positive or negative dephasing of the gravitational waveform, respectively, when compared to the non-interacting case and as long as the field's Compton wavelength is larger than the binary separation. We observe no bosenova emission, which suggests that nonlinearities tend to suppress this phenomenon. Our results highlight how the kinetic and potential terms are both relevant in determining the field dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric Feynman integrals with the regions of integration defined by some polynomials are considered in this paper. It is shown that integrals with irregular integration regions can be converted to standard parametric integrals, for which a reduction method is known. An application of this method to the analytic calculation of three-point energy correlators is presented. In principle, this method applies to more general event shapes and even jet observables.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting fermions on Graphic-Processing-Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description of the entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting fermions, including the existence of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), is a challenging problem with conflicting results in the literature. The mapping of the problem onto a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) indicates that relatively large lattice sizes are required to determine the nature of the entanglement entropy (EE) in the thermodynamics limit. Here we address this problem numerically for monitored non-interacting fermions with $U(1)$ symmetry. The use of Graphic-Processing-Unit (GPU) techniques, even with outdated hardware, makes possible to reach much larger lattice sizes ($L = 16384$ and $160\times160$ in one (1d) and two (2d) dimensions respectively) than in previous studies which enables us to characterize quantitatively the entanglement dynamics. In 1d, we show that in order to confirm the absence of a MIPT, for both projective and homodyne measurements, predicted by the NLSM it is necessary to reach $L \sim 10000$. In 2d, also as predicted by the NLSM, we observe for both protocols a MIPT at finite monitoring rate characterized by a scale invariant mutual information. The critical monitoring strength depends on the protocol while the critical exponent $\nu \approx 1.3$ governing the approach to the MIPT is similar in both cases. These features are not correctly predicted by the NLSM. Our results paves the way for a fully quantitative description of the entanglement dynamics of monitoring quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Extended black hole thermodynamics in a DGP braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended black hole thermodynamics, or ``black hole chemistry,'' is usually formulated in asymptotically AdS spacetimes by promoting the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to a thermodynamic variable and identifying $P=-\Lambda/8\pi$ as the pressure. This approach, however, is less physically motivated: $\Lambda$ is a fixed coupling of the bulk action. Moreover, in de Sitter space, the construction is even more problematic due to the absence of a global timelike Killing vector and the presence of multiple horizons. In this work, we show that extended thermodynamics arises naturally in a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld once the brane tension $\sigma$ is varied in the Iyer--Wald formalism. A positive-tension brane is dynamically stable, ghost-free, and induces a localized vacuum energy density $T^{(\sigma)}_{\mu\nu}=-\sigma g_{\mu\nu}$, corresponding to a negative pressure $P_\sigma=-\sigma$. On the normal branch, the brane is asymptotically flat with a well-defined ADM mass and a single black hole horizon, thereby avoiding the obstructions that arise in de Sitter. We demonstrate that varying $\sigma$ produces a new work term $V_\sigma\,\delta P_\sigma$ in the first law, with $V_\sigma$ reducing exactly to the geometric volume $4\pi r_h^3/3$ for a static spherical black hole. The associated Smarr relation is derived, and we show how asymptotic flatness can be maintained along the family of solutions by co-varying the bulk cosmological constant. Our results establish that extended black hole thermodynamics is not restricted to AdS spacetimes but also arises consistently in asymptotically flat braneworlds through brane tension, providing a new setting for black hole chemistry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational $ D$-Form Factor: The $\sigma$-Meson as a Dilaton confronted with Lattice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon and pion gravitational $D$-form factors, by fitting a $\sigma/f_0(500)$-meson pole, together with a background term, to lattice data at $m_\pi \approx 170\text{MeV}$. We find that the fitted residues are compatible with predictions from dilaton effective theory. In this framework, the $\sigma$-meson takes on the role of the dilaton, the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry. These results support the idea that QCD may be governed by an infrared fixed point and offer a physical interpretation of the $D$-form factor (or $D$-term) in the soft limit.</description>

      <title>A tensor category construction of the $W_{p,q}$ triplet vertex operator algebra and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For coprime $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the triplet vertex operator algebra $W_{p,q}$ is a non-simple extension of the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra of central charge $c_{p,q}=1-\frac{6(p-q)^2}{pq}$, and it is a basic example of a vertex operator algebra appearing in logarithmic conformal field theory. Here, we give a new construction of $W_{p,q}$ different from the original screening operator definition of Feigin-Gainutdinov-Semikhatov-Tipunin. Using our earlier work on the tensor category structure of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$, we show that the simple modules appearing in the decomposition of $W_{p,q}$ as a module for the Virasoro algebra have $PSL_2$-fusion rules and generate a symmetric tensor category equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}\,PSL_2$. Then we use the theory of commutative algebras in braided tensor categories to construct $W_{p,q}$ as an appropriate non-simple modification of the canonical algebra in the Deligne tensor product of $\mathrm{Rep}\,PSL_2$ with this Virasoro subcategory. As a consequence, we show that the automorphism group of $W_{p,q}$ is $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$. We also define a braided tensor category $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ consisting of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$ that induce to untwisted modules of $W_{p,q}$. We show that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ tensor embeds into the $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$-equivariantization of the category of $W_{p,q}$-modules and is closed under contragredient modules. We conjecture that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ has enough projective objects and is the correct category of Virasoro modules for constructing logarithmic minimal models in conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers positive energy theorems in asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes. Particular attention is given to spacetimes where conformal infinity has compact, Einstein cross-sections admitting Killing or parallel spinors; a positive energy theorem is derived for such spacetimes in terms of geometric data intrinsic to the cross-section. This is followed by the first complete proofs of the BPS inequalities in (the bosonic sectors of) 4D and 5D minimal, gauged supergravity, including with magnetic fields. The BPS inequalities are proven for asymptotically AdS spacetimes, but also generalised to the aforementioned class of asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>String Corrected Scalar Field Inflation Compatible with the ACT Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the impact of the first string corrections of minimally coupled single scalar field theory on inflationary dynamics. Specifically we consider separately the string corrections $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi)c_2\,\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ and $\sim \alpha'c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$, where $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale. Our aim is to develop a theory which is self consistent in the sense that the field equations reproduce themselves in the slow-roll approximation. Such a requirement for the theory with $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi) c_2\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ resulted to a trivial non-minimal coupling function $\xi(\phi)$, however a self-consistent framework emerged from the theory with correction term $\sim \alpha' c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$. The resulting theory can easily be worked out analytically and we obtained an inflationary theory that can easily be fitted with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope constraints on the scalar spectral index and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-linearity of the theory of gravity induces a hysteresis effect in both the systems interacting with gravity and in the gravitational field. The effect is usually referred to as the memory effect. In this paper, we explore this phenomenon in the context of the dynamics of extended rotating objects in the presence of a gravitational wave pulse. Then, we consider an ensemble of such objects and show that a redistribution of spin orientations takes place as a gravitational wave passes through. We examine how this redistribution, changes the partition function and the thermodynamic quantities including entropy and energy of the system. The result shows that some information about the source of the gravitation wave is encoded in the thermodynamics of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a qualitatively new regime of inflationary models with small and rapid oscillations in the potential--resonant non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the standard scenario, where most of the observable information is encoded in the power spectrum, in this regime the oscillatory signal predominantly appears in higher-order correlation functions with large $n$. This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [2306.12489], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher--though only logarithmically--when the amplitude of the oscillations is small. We identify a phenomenologically relevant window in which $n$-point functions with $3 \lesssim n \lesssim 9$ are potentially observable. In this regime, the signal exhibits 350 - 1000 oscillations per decade in $k$.</description>

Abstract: We propose a recursive method that makes use of the basic principle of unitarity to calculate the Landau singularities of n-point scattering amplitudes directly in kinematic space. For a vast class of Feynman diagrams, the method enables rapid analytic computation of Landau singularities beyond current state-of-the-art technology. This includes new predictions relevant for two- and higher-loop processes in the Standard Model involving both massive quarks and electroweak particles.</description>

      <title>Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Model spaces as constrained Hamiltonian systems: I. Application to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by group-theoretical questions that arise in the context of asymptotic symmetries in gravity, we study model spaces and their quantization from the viewpoint of constrained Hamiltonian systems. More precisely, we propose that a central building block in the construction of the model space for a generic Lie group $G$ is the symplectic submanifold of $T^*G$ that one obtains when one imposes only the second class constraints in the construction of the coadjoint orbit as a symplectic quotient. Before turning to the non-compact infinite-dimensional groups relevant in the gravitational setting, we work out all details in the simplest case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Besides recovering well-known results on the quantum theory of angular momentum from a unified perspective, the analysis sheds some light on the definition and properties of spin-weighted/monopole spherical harmonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional scattering of a wave packet of a relativistic fermion under a temporally oscillating electric field superimposed on a potential step is discussed by using the Furry-picture perturbation theory, where the oscillating electric field is treated as a perturbation. Reflection and transmission probabilities of the wave packet, which in its single-mode limit are consistent with those in the stationary scattering off the potential step alone, are investigated up to the second order. We show that even in the absence of the so-called Klein region, a positive-frequency incoming wave can penetrate the negative-frequency region below the potential step by emitting its energy to the oscillating electric field with a finite tunneling probability.</description>

      <title>A Multiplicative Formulation of the Higgs Lagrangian and the Fermion Mass Hierarchy between the charged leptons and heavy quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17296v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multiplicative formulation of the Higgs Lagrangian, derived from the inverse problem in the calculus of variations, as an alternative framework to investigate the fermion mass hierarchy. In this setup, fermion masses emerge as discrete quantities determined by a finite set of scaling factors, thereby allowing the observed charged-lepton and heavy-quark masses to be accommodated without introducing arbitrarily small parameters. In addition, this framework admits specific solutions where the Yukawa couplings of the charged leptons and heavy quarks converge to a universal value, approximately coinciding with the Higgs self-coupling. This numerical coincidence provides a potential hint of an underlying dynamical structure that correlates the Higgs sector with the fermion masses. Furthermore, the background-dependent Higgs self-interactions are found to decrease asymptotically, ensuring perturbative consistency in the large-field regime and suggesting possible extensions toward ultraviolet completion.</description>

      <title>Heterotic String Sigma Models: Discrete Light Cone Quantization and Its Current-Current Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional superstring sigma model that defines a self-contained corner of heterotic string theory, whose second quantization is heterotic matrix string theory. This worldsheet theory arises from a BPS decoupling limit that zooms in on the heterotic string, under which the target space geometry becomes non-Lorentzian. This construction generalizes the Gomis-Ooguri formulation of non-relativistic string theory to the heterotic case. We show how such a worldsheet theory provides a first-principles definition of the heterotic string in the discrete light cone quantization via T-duality. By turning on a current-current deformation akin to a $T\bar{T}$ deformation, the conventional heterotic string theory with a Lorentzian target space is recovered. We analyze the gauge and gravitational anomalies with respect to the lowest-order quantum corrections in the sigma model and show how the worldsheet theory is consistent with non-Lorentzian supergravity in the target space.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>

      <title>The (No) Boundary Proposal and excited states in de Sitter holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT framework, vacuum and excited states are systematically described by imposing arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions at the AdS boundary. Furthermore, there are explicit relations connecting the quantum states to their corresponding dual Euclidean AdS geometries, in line with the Hartle-Hawking (HH) construction. The ground state therefore corresponds to the dominant saddle point under trivial conditions on the asymptotic boundary, which is the exact Euclidean AdS geometry. In contrast, the situation in de Sitter spacetime differs significantly, as there is no natural region analogous to the AdS boundary. Thus, the Hartle Hawking approach precisely defines the ground state as a path integral over smooth (Euclidean) geometries ending on a spatial Cauchy surface, with \textit{no} additional boundary or past singularity, known as the no boundary proposal.
  In this work, we revisit the no boundary proposal to describe excited states within the framework of de Sitter Holography. Specifically, we investigate the possibility of defining a family of excited states by introducing an additional boundary in the Euclidean region and imposing arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions on it. As a result, we demonstrate that the computation of $n$ point correlation functions is consistent with the presence of excited states, and furthermore, show that cosmological late-time observables in these states undergo non-trivial modifications. This study may have significant implications for the development of the holographic dictionary for de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A partially broken Fronsdal model for massless higher-spin particles of integer spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing arbitrary parameters in the usual Fronsdal model, we find a region in the parameters space away from the ``Fronsdal point'' where we still have an irreducible description of massless particles of arbitrary integer spin $s\ge 3$. The higher spin gauge symmetry is further constrained by a vanishing double divergence condition on the traceless gauge parameter: $\partial\cdot\partial\cdot\bar\Lambda=0$. Remarkably, it does not introduce extra propagating gauge invariants. We demonstrate that we only have spin-$s$ helicity states as propagating modes for arbitrary integer $s\ge 3$. For the simplest $s=3$ case we present a gauge invariant proof while for $s\ge 4$ we use a light-cone gauge. The reduction in the gauge symmetry allows for more general source couplings when compared to the Fronsdal model.</description>

Abstract: We study the holographic description for general stress-energy tensor deformations in arbitrary dimensions using the metric flow approach. Mixed boundary conditions corresponding to these deformations emerge from solutions to the metric flow equations. To test this proposal, we analyze planar AdS black holes with such boundary conditions and find that the deformed energies satisfy flow equations consistent with the field theory interpretation. We further derive the commuting condition for stress-energy tensor deformations and extend the mixed boundary condition description to accommodate families of commuting deformations.</description>

      <title>Critical Non-Abelian Vortex String and 2D N=2 Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that the non-Abelian vortex string in 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD with the U(2) gauge group and $N_f=4$ flavors becomes a critical superstring. Its 10D target space is a product of the flat 4D space and an internal noncompact Calabi-Yau threefold, namely, the conifold. It was also shown that the Coulomb branch of the associated string sigma model, which opens up at strong coupling, can be described by $\mathcal{N}=2$ Liouville theory. We continue here the study of the recently proposed mass deformation of the U(2) theory with $N_f=4$, interpolating to SQCD with the U(4) gauge group and $N_f=8$ quarks, by analyzing the mass-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ Liouville theory on the string world sheet, and show that it is always described by the trumpet geometry of the target space, which is $T$-dual to the 2D $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric black hole. We use this correspondence to find the low-lying hadron spectrum in the deformed SQCD, and explain the expected increase in the number of hadronic states in the theory with more gauge fields and quarks by considering the near-Hagedorn behavior of the 2D black hole.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tension Strings with Target Scale Symmetry producing DE, DM and why 4D?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the modified measure formulation string or branes the tension appear as an additional dynamical degree of freedom . Furthermore in the presence of an additional background scalar field that couples to the strings and locally changes the tension, the tension field really dynamical and the theory has an intrinsic target space scale symmetry. When many types of strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two types of strings probing the same region of space with different dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to the different strings. Each of these metrics have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the consistency of these two Einsteins equations determine the tension scalar. The universal metric, common to both strings generically does not satisfy Einsteins equation . We review a case where two string dependent metrics considered here are flat space in Minkowski space and Minkowski space after a special conformal transformation and leads to a well defined brane world solution. We review how the model avoid swampland constraints making treatments for Dark energy and inflation more realistic and how strings with a different tension appear as Dark Matter to us. Since the Dark strings and since the visible strings share the space time, including the same compactification, and since the compactification determines the particle content, we argue that the dark strings lead to Dark copies of the standard model. An argument that many copies will lead to 4D effective spacetime as a consequence of a target space scale symmetry restoration.</description>

Abstract: We justify the applicability of the background subtraction method to both Einstein's gravity and its higher derivative corrections in 5-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, where the corresponding higher derivative corrections to the expression for the ADM mass and angular momentum are also worked out. Then we further apply the background subtraction method to calculate the first order corrected Gibbs free energy by the quadratic curvature terms for the 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole, which is in exact agreement with the previous result obtained by the holographic renormalization method. Such an agreement in turn substantiates the applicability of the background subtraction method.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition to RS: Cool, not Supercool</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the warped conifold compactification, we model the infrared (IR) dynamics of confining gauge theories in a Randall-Sundrum (RS)-like setup by modifying the stabilizing Goldberger-Wise (GW) potential so that it becomes large (in magnitude) in the IR and back-reacts on the geometry. We study the high-temperature phase by considering a black brane background in which we calculate the entropy and free energy of the strongly back-reacted solution. As with Buchel's result for the conifold (arXiv:2103.15188), we find a minimum temperature beyond which the black brane phase is thermodynamically unstable. In the context of a phase transition to the confining background, our results suggest that the amount of supercooling that the metastable black brane phase undergoes can be limited. It also suggests the first-order phase transition (and the associated gravitational waves from bubble collision) is not universal. Our results therefore have important phenomenological implications for early universe model building in these scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The spinor-helicity formalism in particle physics gives rise to natural subvarieties in the product of two Grassmannians. These include two-step flag varieties for subspaces of complementary dimension. Taking Hadamard products leads to Mandelstam varieties. We study these varieties through the lens of combinatorics and commutative algebra, and we explore their tropicalization, positive geometry, and scattering correspondence.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Ooguri-Vafa symplectic form \`a la Atiyah-Bott</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke predicted that the hyperk\"ahler Ooguri-Vafa space $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ should provide a local model for Hitchin moduli spaces near the discriminant locus. To this end, Tulli identified $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ with a certain space of framed Higgs bundles with an irregular singularity. We extend this result by identifying the Ooguri-Vafa holomorphic symplectic form with a regularized version of the Atiyah-Bott form on the associated space of framed connections. We also prove the analogous statement for the corresponding semiflat forms. Finally, restricting to the Hitchin section, we identify a regularized version of Hitchin's $L^2$-metric with the Ooguri-Vafa metric.</description>

      <title>Regulated chiral gauge theory and the strong CP problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional chiral gauge theory can be formulated as the boundary theory on a five-dimensional manifold in a manner that may be realized on a finite lattice. There are interesting features of these theories which defy a purely four-dimensional conception of universality. We find that QCD when embedded in a chiral gauge theory (the Standard Model) and regulated this way appears to suffer neither from a $U(1)_A$ problem nor a strong $CP$ problem, with a central role played by fermion zeromodes localized far away in the fifth dimension. In this way it differs from conventional lattice QCD formulated as a stand-alone theory. Our analysis builds on recent work by others that highlights the role of global $U(1)$ symmetries in five dimensional formulations of four-dimensional chiral gauge theories, and the generic appearance of fermion zeromodes in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Inflationary scenarios beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this chapter is to explain in clear and pedagogical terms how some particle-physics models and/or mechanisms can naturally lead to inflation and how this can provide testable predictions that can help us find new physics effects. Two well-established features of theoretical particle physics are linked to an essential property of inflation, a naturally-flat inflaton potential: (1) scale invariance, broken by small quantum corrections, and (2) Goldstone's theorem. It is also illustrated how to combine several scenarios of this type to obtain a rather general particle-physics motivated inflationary setup.</description>

      <title>Production of $K^+K^-$ Pairs Through Decay of $\phi$ Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for the production of $K^+K^-$ pairs through the decay of $\phi$ mesons produced from a thermal background, based on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The differential production rate of $K^+K^-$ is related to the self-energy of the $\phi$ meson, incorporating the contributions of the quark loop at leading order and the kaon loop at next-to-leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. We numerically evaluate the invariant mass spectrum of the $K^+K^-$ pair both in vacuum and at finite temperature. The inclusion of the kaon loop results in a finite width of the spectrum, improving agreement with experimental data. We also investigate the spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson induced by its motion relative to the thermal background. In the NJL model with only chiral condensates, we find that deviations from the unpolarized limit of 1/3 are negligible.</description>

      <title>Noncovariant parabolic theories of relativistic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new first-order theory of relativistic dissipation has been recently proposed, where viscous effects are incorporated using the traditional Navier-Stokes framework. Its main novelty is the avoidance of dynamical instabilities by allowing different observers to use equations that are not related by exact Lorentz transformations. In this work, we explore the implications of this non-covariance in depth. In particular, we discuss how predictions differ between observers moving at nearly luminal speeds relative to each other. We find that all disagreements stem from the relativity of simultaneity, which introduces frame-dependent anisotropic delays in the diffusive process. These anisotropies significantly limit the applicability of the equation used by observers who move very fast relative to the medium. However, the magnitude of the related error remains finite at infinite Lorentz factors, meaning that it is possible to find a regime where all observers agree on the outcome of experiments.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.</description>

      <title>Predictability of quantum observables: Applications in QKD and top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We deepen our understanding of transmitting classical information using quantum means by analyzing the prediction of local quantum observables enhanced by quantum correlations. Our approach focuses on two complementary measures of prediction error, the Bayes risk and the inference variance, both rooted in statistical learning theory. We provide, to our knowledge, the first analytical minimizations of these quantities for arbitrary two-qubit states, together with the optimal measurement strategies. We further analyze their averaged forms, revealing a direct connection to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criteria. We also embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol, demonstrating higher secure-key rates than the standard BB84 scheme under realistic noise. Finally, we illustrate our results for (i) amplitude-damped Bell pairs, and (ii) spin correlations in top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy collisions, highlighting quantum states produced in colliders as a novel platform for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we have taken into account.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. Our analysis reveals that the predicted value of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ by the DESI DR2 LRG1 and LRG3+ELG1 datapoints deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction and from different supernova compilations. We find that analyzing the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers strongly affects the model predictions especially $\omega_0$, which shifts from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Finite-Width Neural Tangent Kernels from Feynman Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep, non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise recursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We validate our results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bianchi I cosmological solutions in f(T) gravity are discussed. We start from diagonal metrics and tetrads and show that their dynamical equations are pretty much tractable analytically, with a possible arena for physical applications. Then we derive a very bad unpredictability of the teleparallel connection in these configurations. Namely, even for the simple isotropic Friedmann universes, one might apply an arbitrary time-dependent spatial rotation to the standard tetrad without changing anything in the cosmological equations.</description>
