      <title>Relatively-Secure LLM-Based Steganography via Constrained Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linguistic steganography aims to conceal information within natural language text without being detected. An effective steganography approach should encode the secret message into a minimal number of language tokens while preserving the natural appearance and fluidity of the stego-texts. We present a new framework to enhance the embedding efficiency of stego-texts generated by modifying the output of a large language model (LLM). The novelty of our approach is in abstracting the sequential steganographic embedding process as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), which takes into consideration the long-term dependencies instead of merely the immediate effects. We constrain the solution space such that the discounted accumulative total variation divergence between the selected probability distribution and the original distribution given by the LLM is below a threshold. To find the optimal policy, we first show that the functional optimization problem can be simplified to a convex optimization problem with a finite number of variables. A closed-form solution for the optimal policy is then presented to this equivalent problem. It is remarkable that the optimal policy is deterministic and resembles water-filling in some cases. The solution suggests that usually adjusting the probability distribution for the state that has the least random transition probability should be prioritized, but the choice should be made by taking into account the transition probabilities at all states instead of only the current state.</description>

      <title>Efficient Covering Using Reed--Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient algorithm to find a Reed-Solomon (RS) codeword at a distance within the covering radius of the code from any point in its ambient Hamming space. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt of its kind to solve the covering problem for RS codes. The proposed algorithm leverages off-the-shelf decoding methods for RS codes, including the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm for unique decoding and the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm for list decoding. We also present theoretical and numerical results on the capabilities of the proposed algorithm and, in particular, the average covering radius resulting from it. Our numerical results suggest that the overlapping Hamming spheres of radius close to the Guruswami-Sudan decoding radius centered at the codewords cover most of the ambient Hamming space.</description>

      <title>On Iso-Dual MDS Codes From Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a linear code $C$ over a finite field, if its dual code $C^{\perp}$ is equivalent to itself, then the code $C$ is said to be {\it isometry-dual}. In this paper, we first confirm a conjecture about the isometry-dual MDS elliptic codes proposed by Han and Ren. Subsequently, two constructions of isometry-dual maximum distance separable (MDS) codes from elliptic curves are presented. The new code length $n$ satisfies $n\le\frac{q+\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor-1}{2}$ when $q$ is even and $n\le\frac{q+\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor-3}{2}$ when $q$ is odd. Additionally, we consider the hull dimension of both constructions. In the case of finite fields with even characteristics, an isometry-dual MDS code is equivalent to a self-dual MDS code and a linear complementary dual MDS code. Finally, we apply our results to entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes (EAQECCs) and obtain two new families of MDS EAQECCs.</description>

      <title>Improving Wireless Federated Learning via Joint Downlink-Uplink Beamforming over Analog Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) over wireless networks using analog transmission can efficiently utilize the communication resource but is susceptible to errors caused by noisy wireless links. In this paper, assuming a multi-antenna base station, we jointly design downlink-uplink beamforming to maximize FL training convergence over time-varying wireless channels. We derive the round-trip model updating equation and use it to analyze the FL training convergence to capture the effects of downlink and uplink beamforming and the local model training on the global model update. Aiming to maximize the FL training convergence rate, we propose a low-complexity joint downlink-uplink beamforming (JDUBF) algorithm, which adopts a greedy approach to decompose the multi-round joint optimization and convert it into per-round online joint optimization problems. The per-round problem is further decomposed into three subproblems over a block coordinate descent framework, where we show that each subproblem can be efficiently solved by projected gradient descent with fast closed-form updates. An efficient initialization method that leads to a closed-form initial point is also proposed to accelerate the convergence of JDUBF. Simulation demonstrates that JDUBF substantially outperforms the conventional separate-link beamforming design.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squared Extended {\eta}-{\mu} and {\kappa}-{\mu} RVs: A New Framework Applied to FR3 and Sub-THz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of systems operating in future frequency ranges calls for a proper statistical channel characterization through generalized fading models. In this paper, we adopt the Extended {\eta}-{\mu} and {\kappa}-{\mu} models to characterize the propagation in FR3 and the sub-THz band, respectively. For these models, we develop a new exact representation of the sum of squared independent and identically distributed random variables, which can be used to express the power of the received signal in multi-antenna systems. Unlike existing ones, the proposed analytical framework is remarkably tractable and computationally efficient, and thus can be conveniently employed to analyze systems with massive antenna arrays. For both the Extended {\eta}-{\mu} and {\kappa}-{\mu} distributions, we derive novel expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function, we analyze their convergence and truncation error, and we discuss the computational complexity and implementation aspects. Moreover, we derive expressions for the outage and coverage probability, bit error probability for coherent binary modulations, and symbol error probability for M-ary phase-shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation. Lastly, we provide an extensive performance evaluation of FR3 and sub-THz systems focusing on a downlink scenario where a single-antenna user is served by a base station employing maximum ratio transmission.</description>

      <title>Digital Fairness Algorithms for Satellite Uplink NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving digital fairness by using NOMA is one of the more pressing issues in modern wireless communication systems for 5G/6G networks. This is particularly true in the case of satellite uplink systems supporting a population of IoT wireless devices scattered in a wide coverage area. In this scenario, the variability of the link budget across space and time increases the challenges of preventing a situation where only a subset of network users can transmit while others are left unable to do so. This work investigates the characteristics of an uplink NOMA system with the goal of equalizing the achievable rate of the IoT network subscribers. Within the context of single-slot NOMA, two key outcomes are achieved: the determination of the optimal SIC ordering at the receiver and the exploration of power moderation, coordinated by the receiver, to maximize the minimum user rate. In the context of multi-slot NOMA, which is particularly relevant to the satellite scenario under consideration, a user rate equalization algorithm is proposed and its performance is analyzed numerically. The trade-off between network performance, measured in terms of user rates, and complexity, determined by the number of SIC steps implemented at the receiver, is thoroughly evaluated for the satellite scenario under consideration.</description>

      <title>Self-dual codes and LCD codes in sum-rank metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum-rank codes are an important class of codes which can be utilized for linear network coding, space-time coding and distributed storage. Based on the duality theory of sum-rank codes [Byrne, Gluesing-Luerssen, Ravagnani, IEEE TIT, 2021], it is interesting to study self-dual sum-rank codes and linear complementary dual (LCD) sum-rank codes.Firstly, we characterize the dual codes of some sum-rank codes. Then we define self-dual sum-rank codes and LCD sum-rank codes, provide some basic properties of such codes and then obtain two methods of constructing self-dual sum-rank codes and LCD sum-rank codes from Euclidean self-dual codes and Euclidean LCD codes. Some particular examples especially some cyclic self-dual sum-rank codes and cyclic LCD sum-rank codes with good parameters are also provided. At last, we prove that there exist asymptotically good self-dual sum-rank codes.</description>

      <title>A Fast Decoding Algorithm for Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes and Alternant Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that the syndromes of generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes and alternant codes can be characterized in terms of inverse fast Fourier transform, regardless of code definitions. Then a fast decoding algorithm is proposed, which has a computational complexity of $O(n\log(n-k) + (n-k)\log^2(n-k))$ for all $(n,k)$ GRS codes and $(n,k)$ alternant codes. Particularly, this provides a new decoding method for Goppa codes, which is an important subclass of alternant codes. When decoding the binary Goppa code with length $8192$ and correction capability $128$, the new algorithm is nearly 10 times faster than traditional methods. The decoding algorithm is suitable for the McEliece cryptosystem, which is a candidate for post-quantum cryptography techniques.</description>

      <title>Achieving Hiding and Smart Anti-Jamming Communication: A Parallel DRL Approach against Moving Reactive Jammer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of anti-jamming in moving reactive jamming scenarios. The moving reactive jammer initiates high-power tracking jamming upon detecting any transmission activity, and when unable to detect a signal, resorts to indiscriminate jamming. This presents dual imperatives: maintaining hiding to avoid the jammer's detection and simultaneously evading indiscriminate jamming. Spread spectrum techniques effectively reduce transmitting power to elude detection but fall short in countering indiscriminate jamming. Conversely, changing communication frequencies can help evade indiscriminate jamming but makes the transmission vulnerable to tracking jamming without spread spectrum techniques to remain hidden. Current methodologies struggle with the complexity of simultaneously optimizing these two requirements due to the expansive joint action spaces and the dynamics of moving reactive jammers. To address these challenges, we propose a parallelized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy. The approach includes a parallelized network architecture designed to decompose the action space. A parallel exploration-exploitation selection mechanism replaces the $\varepsilon $-greedy mechanism, accelerating convergence. Simulations demonstrate a nearly 90\% increase in normalized throughput.</description>

      <title>Rate-reliability functions for deterministic identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate deterministic identification over arbitrary memoryless channels under the constraint that the error probabilities of first and second kind are exponentially small in the block length $n$, controlled by reliability exponents $E_1,E_2 \geq 0$. In contrast to the regime of slowly vanishing errors, where the identifiable message length scales as $\Theta(n\log n)$, here we find that for positive exponents linear scaling is restored, now with a rate that is a function of the reliability exponents. We give upper and lower bounds on the ensuing rate-reliability function in terms of (the logarithm of) the packing and covering numbers of the channel output set, which for small error exponents $E_1,E_2&gt;0$ can be expanded in leading order as the product of the Minkowski dimension of a certain parametrisation the channel output set and $\log\min\{E_1,E_2\}$. These allow us to recover the previously observed slightly superlinear identification rates, and offer a different perspective for understanding them in more traditional information theory terms. We further illustrate our results with a discussion of the case of dimension zero, and extend them to classical-quantum channels and quantum channels with tensor product input restriction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a predictive game in which a Forecaster announces odds based on a time-homogeneous Markov kernel, establishing a game-theoretic law of large numbers for the relative frequencies of occurrences of all finite strings. A key feature of our proof is a betting strategy built on a universal coding scheme, inspired by the martingale convergence theorem and algorithmic randomness theory, without relying on a diversified betting approach that involves countably many operating accounts. We apply these insights to thermodynamics, offering a game-theoretic perspective on Le\'o Szil\'ard's thought experiment.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Based Localization of Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted bi-static localization architecture for the sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network. The system consists of a transmit user, a receive base station (BS), an IRS, and multiple targets in either the far-field or near-field region of the IRS. In particular, we focus on the challenging scenario where the line-of-sight (LOS) paths between targets and the BS are blocked, such that the emitted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals from the user reach the BS merely via the user-target-IRS-BS path. Based on the signals received by the BS, our goal is to localize the targets by estimating their relative positions to the IRS, instead of to the BS. We show that subspace-based methods, such as the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, can be applied onto the BS's received signals to estimate the relative states from the targets to the IRS. To this end, we create a virtual signal via combining user-target-IRS-BS channels over various time slots. By applying MUSIC on such a virtual signal, we are able to detect the far-field targets and the near-field targets, and estimate the angle-of-arrivals (AOAs) and/or ranges from the targets to the IRS. Furthermore, we theoretically verify that the proposed method can perfectly estimate the relative states from the targets to the IRS in the ideal case with infinite coherence blocks. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed IRS-assisted localization scheme. Our paper demonstrates the potential of employing passive anchors, i.e., IRSs, to improve the sensing coverage of the active anchors, i.e., BSs.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Proofs for Diffusion Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an elementary, self-contained analysis of diffusion-based sampling methods for generative modeling. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on continuous-time processes and then discretize, our treatment works directly with discrete-time stochastic processes and yields precise non-asymptotic convergence guarantees under broad assumptions. The key insight is to couple the sampling process of interest with an idealized comparison process that has an explicit Gaussian-convolution structure. We then leverage simple identities from information theory, including the I-MMSE relationship, to bound the discrepancy (in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence) between these two discrete-time processes. In particular, we show that, if the diffusion step sizes are chosen sufficiently small and one can approximate certain conditional mean estimators well, then the sampling distribution is provably close to the target distribution. Our results also provide a transparent view on how to accelerate convergence by introducing additional randomness in each step to match higher order moments in the comparison process.</description>

      <title>Capacity Results for Intermittent X-Channels with Delayed Channel State Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.03066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the capacity region of noiseless X-Channels with intermittent connectivity and delayed channel state information at the transmitters. We consider the general case in which each transmitter has a common message for both receivers, and a private message for each one of them. We develop a new set of outer-bounds that quantify the interference alignment capability of each transmitter with delayed channel state feedback and when each receiver must receive a baseline entropy corresponding to the common message. We also develop a transmission strategy that achieves the outer-bounds under homogeneous channel assumption by opportunistically treating the X-Channel as a combination of a number of well-known problems such as the interference channel and the multicast channel. The capacity-achieving strategies of these sub-problems must be interleaved and carried on simultaneously in certain regimes in order to achieve the X-Channel outer-bounds. We also extend the outer-bounds to include non-homogeneous channel parameters.</description>

      <title>Segmented GRAND: Complexity Reduction through Sub-Pattern Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ordered-reliability bits (ORB) variant of guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND), known as ORBGRAND, achieves remarkably low time complexity at high code rates compared to other GRAND variants. However, its computational complexity remains higher than other near-ML universal decoders like ordered-statistics decoding (OSD). To address this, we propose segmented ORBGRAND, which partitions the error pattern search space based on code properties, generates syndrome-consistent sub-patterns (reducing invalid error patterns), and combines them in a near-ML order using sub-weights derived from two-level integer partitions of logistic weight. Numerical results show that segmented ORBGRAND reduces the average number of queries by at least 66\% across all SNRs and cuts basic operations by over an order of magnitude, depending on segmentation and code rate. Further efficiency gains come from leveraging pre-generated shared sub-patterns, reducing average decoding time. Furthermore, with abandonment ($b=10^{5}$ or smaller), segmented ORBGRAND provides a 0.2 dB power gain over ORBGRAND. Additionally, we provide an analytical justification for why the logistic weight-based ordering of error patterns in ORBGRAND closely approximates the ML order and discuss the underlying assumptions of ORBGRAND.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Location Privacy in SIMO Communication Using Fake Path Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fake path injection is an emerging paradigm for inducing privacy over wireless networks. In this paper, fake paths are injected by the transmitters into a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) communication channel to obscure their physical location from an eavesdropper. The case where the receiver (Bob) and the eavesdropper (Eve) use a linear uniform array to locate the transmitter's (Alice) position is considered. A novel statistical privacy metric is defined as the ratio between the smallest (resp. largest) eigenvalues of Eve's (resp. Bob's) Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRB) on the SIMO channel parameters to assess the privacy enhancements. Leveraging the spectral properties of generalized Vandermonde matrices, bounds on the privacy margin of the proposed scheme are derived. Specifically, it is shown that the privacy margin increases quadratically in the inverse of the angular separation between the true and the fake paths under Eve's perspective. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings on CRBs and showcase the approach's benefit in terms of bit error rates achievable by Bob and Eve.</description>

      <title>Deterministic identification over channels with finite output: a dimensional perspective on superlinear rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following initial work by JaJa, Ahlswede and Cai, and inspired by a recent renewed surge in interest in deterministic identification (DI) via noisy channels, we consider the problem in its generality for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. Such a channel is essentially given by its output distributions as a subset in the probability simplex. Our main findings are that the maximum length of messages thus identifiable scales superlinearly as $R\,n\log n$ with the block length $n$, and that the optimal rate $R$ is bounded in terms of the covering (aka Minkowski, or Kolmogorov, or entropy) dimension $d$ of a certain algebraic transformation of the output set: $\frac14 d \leq R \leq \frac12 d$. Remarkably, both the lower and upper Minkowski dimensions play a role in this result. Along the way, we present a "Hypothesis Testing Lemma" showing that it is sufficient to ensure pairwise reliable distinguishability of the output distributions to construct a DI code. Although we do not know the exact capacity formula, we can conclude that the DI capacity exhibits superactivation: there exist channels whose capacities individually are zero, but whose product has positive capacity. We also generalise these results to classical-quantum channels with finite-dimensional output quantum system, in particular to quantum channels on finite-dimensional quantum systems under the constraint that the identification code can only use tensor product inputs.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Multi-Stage Algorithm and Bounds for Group Testing with Prior Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-stage algorithm for non-adaptive Group Testing (GT) with general correlated prior statistics. The proposed solution can be applied to any correlated statistical prior represented in trellis, e.g., finite state machines and Markov processes. We introduce a variation of List Viterbi Algorithm (LVA) to enable accurate recovery using much fewer tests than objectives, which efficiently gains from the correlated prior statistics structure. We also provide a sufficiency bound to the number of pooled tests required by any Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decoder with an arbitrary correlation between infected items. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-Stage GT (MSGT) algorithm can obtain the optimal MAP performance with feasible complexity in practical regimes, such as with COVID-19 and sparse signal recovery applications, and reduce in the scenarios tested the number of pooled tests by at least 25% compared to existing classical low complexity GT algorithms. Moreover, we analytically characterize the complexity of the proposed MSGT algorithm that guarantees its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Iterative Inversion of Ill-Conditioned MIMO Channels Using Symmetric Rank-$1$ Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While iterative matrix inversion methods excel in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and support for parallel and distributed computing when managing large matrices, their limitations are also evident in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-1 regularization (SR-1R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-1 matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-1R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate that SR-1R has the potential to reduce the required iteration by up to 35% while achieving the performance of regularized zero-forcing.</description>

      <title>Singular Detection in Noncoherent Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general analysis of codeword detection in noncoherent communications. Motivated by the existence of error floors in various regimes, fundamental characteristics of signal design are investigated. In particular, the necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotically singular detection (i.e. error-free in the limit) are derived from classical results in detection theory. By leveraging tools from linear algebra and the theory of Hilbert spaces, we are able to characterize asymptotic singularity in two main scenarios: the large array and high SNR regimes. The results generalize previous works and extend the notion of unique identification, as well as re-contextualize the geometry of Grassmannian constellations from an alternative perspective.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work leverages Shearer's inequalities to derive a new upper bound on the maximum cardinality of a family of graphs on a fixed number of vertices, in which every pair of graphs shares a fixed common subgraph. The derived bound is expressed in terms of the chromatic number of the shared subgraph. Additionally, Shearer's inequalities, in conjunction with properties of the Shannon entropy, are employed to establish bounds related to the enumeration of graph homomorphisms, providing further insights into the interplay between combinatorial structures and information-theoretic principles.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>
