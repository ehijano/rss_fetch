      <title>Network stochastic resonance under higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although stochastic resonance phenomena are ubiquitous across various complex systems, the influence mechanisms of higher-order interactions remain elusive. Here, we address this gap by investigating stochastic resonance in coupled phase oscillators with triadic interactions on ring networks that feature periodic modulation of the triadic coupling strength and additive noise. Our analysis reveals that higher-order interactions create fundamentally different resonance landscapes through time-varying potential wells generated by periodic modulation of triadic coupling, enabling novel noise-enhanced processing mechanisms. Additionally, weaker pairwise coupling amplifies resonance effects, while moderate network connectivity appears optimal compared to extensive connections. Our findings establish fundamental principles for network stochastic resonance and provide insights for enhanced signal processing in complex networks.</description>

      <title>A generative model of function growth explains hidden self-similarities across biological and social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.</description>
