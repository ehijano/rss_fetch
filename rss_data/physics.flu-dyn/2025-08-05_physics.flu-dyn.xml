      <title>Breakup cascade in gas filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its importance in both geophysical and industrial contexts, the inertial fragmentation of gas filaments has received much less attention than their liquid counterparts. Yet, gas filaments produce the smallest bubble sizes, which drive gas dissolution, critical to ocean-atmosphere exchange such as carbon dioxide and oxygen, as well as marine aerosols emission, serving as nuclei for cloud condensation and ice particle production. Here, we unravel the fundamental physics governing the splitting of a single filament in a model geometry by combining numerical simulations, laboratory experiments and theory. We show that the splitting of a single filament generates a power-law bubble size distribution following $d^{-3/2}$ with $d$ the volume equivalent bubble diameter, suggesting the existence of a self-similar breakup mechanism, absent in liquid ligament fragmentation. We propose a deterministic model, based on the capillary fragmentation of a filament with power-law shape, which quantitatively captures the bubble size distribution. We demonstrate that the filament shape at breakup sets the size distribution of a first generation of bubbles. This distribution is then reproduced at smaller and smaller scales by latter breakups in a self-similar manner. The $d^{-3/2}$-distribution coincides with the size distribution of small bubbles observed in dilute turbulent flow, such as below breaking waves. We argue that the turbulent bubble size distribution observed in nature arises as the superposition of many individual filament splittings. The turbulence nature of the flow only sets the initial conditions of each splitting dynamics, and play no role in the bubble size selection.</description>

      <title>Capillary currents and viscous droplet spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study of the spreading of viscous droplets over rough and smooth substrates. First, we experimentally investigate the wetting of a roughened glass surface by a viscous droplet of silicone oil, wide and shallow relative to the capillary length $\ell_c$. The radius of the droplet grows according to a $R_\mathrm{drop}\sim t^{1/8}$ scaling reminiscent of gravity currents (Lopez, 1976; Voinov, 1999). The droplet is preceded by a mesoscopic fluid film that percolates through the rough substrate, its radius increasing according to $R_\mathrm{film}\sim t^{3/8}/(\log t)^{1/2}$. To rationalize these observed scalings, we develop a new 'capillary current' model for the spreading of shallow droplets with arbitrary radius on both smooth and rough surfaces. We propose that, throughout their evolution, capillary currents maintain a quasi-equilibrium balance between hydrostatic and curvature pressure, perturbed only by unbalanced contact line forces arising along the droplet's edge. In addition to rationalizing our experimental data, our model provides new rationale for a number of scalings reported in prior work. In particular, for drops small with respect to $\ell_c$, it recovers the classic spreading laws of Tanner (1979) and Hoffman (1975); for drops wide with respect to $\ell_c$, it reveals how millimetric, surface-tension-driven capillary currents exhibit the same spreading behavior as relatively large-scale viscous gravity currents.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks for cavity flows using coordinate transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted attention as an alternative approach to solve partial differential equations using a deep neural network (DNN). Their simplicity and capability allow them to solve inverse problems for many applications. Despite the versatility of PINNs, it remains challenging to reduce their training cost. Using a DNN pre-trained with an arbitrary dataset with transfer learning or fine-tuning is a potential solution. However, a pre-trained model using a different geometry and flow condition than the target may not produce suitable results. This paper proposes a fine-tuning approach for PINNs with coordinate transformation, modelling lid-driven cavity flows with various shapes. We formulate the inverse problem, where the reference data inside the domain and wall boundary conditions are given. A pre-trained PINN model with an arbitrary Reynolds number and shape is used to initialize a target DNN. To reconcile the reference shape with different targets, governing equations as a loss of the PINNs are given with coordinate transformation using a deformation gradient tensor. Numerical examples for various cavity flows with square, rectangular, and shear deformed geometries demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning approach improves the training convergence compared with an un-trained model. A pre-trained model with a similar geometry to the target further increases training efficiency. These findings are useful for real-world applications such as modelling intra-aneurysmal blood flows in clinical use.</description>

      <title>Active biphasic heat transfer enhancement in vertical natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical natural convection (VC), often cannot meet the high heat transfer demands due to the inherent misalignment of the direction of buoyancy (vertical) with the direction of the heat transfer (horizontal). Here we applied a novel strategy on a water based VC system to enhance the heat transfer. By adding 2% of the total volume with a low-boiling-temperature liquid (HFE-7000) and introducing a gas-liquid layer on top of the VC cell, we create a self-sustained state of pseudo-turbulence with evaporating, circulating and condensing biphasic bubbles. The system achieves 246% heat transfer enhancement at constant superheat $T_{sup}\approx6.4 \text{K}$ when the liquid in the full nucleate boiling state. Using shadowgraphy and Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) methods, we validate that the bubbles and biphasic particles induced agitation enhances the heat flux and modifies the temperature field of the heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Rim destabilization and re-formation upon severance from its expanding sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon radial liquid sheet expansion, a bounding rim forms, with a thickness and stability governed, in part, by the liquid influx from the unsteady connected sheet. We examine how the thickness and fragmentation of such a radially expanding rim change upon its severance from its sheet, absent of liquid influx. To do so, we design an experiment enabling the study of rims pre and post severance by vaporizing the thin neck connecting the rim. We confirm that the severed rim follows a ballistic motion, with a radial velocity inherited from the sheet at severance time. We identify that the severed rim undergoes fragmentation in two types of junctions: the base of inherited, pre-severance, ligaments and the junction between nascent rim corrugations, with no significant distinction between the two associated timescales. The number of ligaments and fragments formed is captured well by the theoretical prediction of rim corrugation and ligament wavenumbers established for unsteady expanding sheets upon droplet impact on surfaces of comparable size to the droplet, and with the sheet thickness profiles in both systems having the same functional form. Our findings are robust to changes in impacting laser energy and initial droplet size. Finally, we report and analyze the re-formation of the rim on the expanding sheet and propose a prediction for its characteristic corrugation timescale. Our findings highlight the fundamental mechanisms governing interfacial destabilization of connected fluid-fed expanding rims that become severed, thereby clarifying destabilization of freely radially expanding toroidal fluid structures absent of fluid influx.</description>

      <title>Upper bound of transient growth in accelerating and decelerating wall-driven flows using the Lyapunov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes accelerating and decelerating wall-driven flows by quantifying the upper bound of transient energy growth using a Lyapunov-type approach. By formulating the linearized Navier-Stokes equations as a linear time-varying system and constructing a time-dependent Lyapunov function, we obtain a rigorous upper bound on transient energy growth by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The LMI approach can obtain the upper bound of transient energy growth that closely matches transient growth computed via the singular value decomposition of the state-transition matrix of linear time-varying systems. Our analysis captures that decelerating base flows exhibit significantly larger transient growth compared with accelerating flows. Our approach offers the advantages of providing a rigorous certificate of uniform stability and an invariant ellipsoid to bound the solution trajectory. This Lyapunov-based analysis also has the potential to be extended to input-output analysis and nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Markovian Navier-Stokes Framework for Turbulence Modeling -- A Preliminary Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a formulation of the Navier Stokes equations (NSE) using fractional calculus in modeling turbulence. By generalizing the stress strain constitutive relation to incorporate nonlocal spatial interactions and memory effects, we redefine a fractional Navier Stokes equation (fNSE). Regarding the inertial range scaling, the fractional Laplacian of order 1/3 and time fractional derivative capture non Markovian energy transfer. The one dimensional advection diffusion equation, for the purpose of initial validation and Burgers non-linear equation for the energy spectrum behavior are employed to investigate numerically the fNSE formulation. Moreover, the transient one-dimensional heat equation and the Caputo derivative embedded Burgers equations are solved, demonstrating the solution behavior regarding temporal memory effects. To simulate turbulent kinetic energy decay, we numerically solve the incompressible NSE using a pseudo spectral method in a 3D periodic domain, demonstrating the fNSE solution behavior. Key unresolved challenges include: Enforcing boundary conditions in fractional models. Hybridizing fNSE with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approaches. Bridging fNSE with Lagrangian averaged models like Navier Stokes alpha. Calibrating fractional parameters and developing robust numerical strategies (e.g., preconditioning). These directions remain critical for future research.</description>

      <title>A Third-Order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory Compact Least-Squares Scheme for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Non-Uniform Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory compact least-squares scheme is developed for the finite volume method on structured curvilinear non-uniform grids. The proposed scheme features compact least-squares reconstruction with optimal linear weights for broad-spectrum accuracy and non-linear weights for essentially non-oscillatory property. Through explicit second-order polynomials given for each control volume, the scheme maintains high accuracy on structured meshes with non-uniform grids. By integrating an improved shock detector developed in this work, coefficients with adaptive levels of dissipation are applied to achieve both the high resolution in smooth regions and high robustness in discontinuous regions. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is extended to the Euler equations through a characteristic decomposition technique. Numerical examples including both linear convection equation and nonlinear Euler/Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the robustness and high-resolution of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Compact Least-Squares and Central Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Structured Curvilinear Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of third- and fifth-order hybrid compact least-squares central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes are proposed and applied to curvilinear structured grids for the finite volume method. In smooth regions, compact least-squares schemes based on interfacial differences of derivatives are utilized to keep the high resolution of multiscale structures, whereas in discontinuous regions, central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes are included to enable the oscillation free shock capturing capability of the hybrid schemes. Free parameters in the proposed compact least-squares schemes are firstly optimized to reach a broad range of resolved bandwidths with different levels of dissipation. In addition, a shock detector proposed in our previous work is introduced and validated to be not only able to detect smooth first-order extrema but also robust in detecting discontinuities. Through the solution of block tridiagonal reconstruction linear systems, the resulting schemes can give an explicit polynomial for each control volume and are efficient with an acceptable computational overhead when compared to the pure central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes. Eventually, benchmarks including one-dimensional and two-dimensional, linear and nonlinear, inviscid and viscous problems on uniform and nonuniform curvilinear grids demonstrate the proposed schemes' promising applicability in compressible flows which have both multiscale structures and discontinuities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small water tunnel was designed as a table top experiment to visualize and measure basic fluid dynamic phenomena. The visualization of the flow by a laser light sheet and the measurement with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) proves to be very instructive for teaching high school and university students. Three basic fluid dynamic experiments are reported: the determination of the vortex shedding frequency of a cylinder (von-Karman vortex street), the measurement of circulation around a flat plate and the lift coefficient of a NACA profile. All three experiments show good agreement with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Fourier Basis Neural Network for Fluid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important yet challenging task in fluid mechanics. In this study, we embed an improved Fourier series into neural networks and propose a physics-informed Fourier basis neural network (FBNN) by incorporating physical information to solve canonical PDEs in fluid mechanics. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework exhibits a strong nonlinear fitting capability and exceptional periodic modeling performance. In particular, our model shows significant advantages for the Burgers equation with discontinuous solutions and Helmholtz equation with strong periodicity. By directly introducing sparse distributed data to reconstruct the entire flow field, we further intuitively validated the direct superiority of FBNN over conventional artificial neural networks (ANN) as well as the benefits of incorporating physical information into the network. By adjusting the activation functions of networks and comparing with an ANN and conventional physics-informed neural network, we proved that performance of the proposed FBNN architecture is not highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions. The nonlinear fitting capability of FBNN avoids excessive reliance on activation functions, thereby mitigating the risk of suboptimal outcomes or training failures stemming from unsuitable activation function choices.hese results highlightthe potential of PIFBNN as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transition to the buoyancy dominated regime in a planar temporal forced plume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transition from momentum- to buoyancy-dominated regime in temporal jets forced by gravity. From the conservation of the thermal content and of the volume flux, we develop a simple model which is able to describe accurately the transition between the two regimes in terms of a single parameter representing the entrainment coefficient. Our analytical results are validated against a set of numerical simulations of temporal planar forced plumes at different initial values of Reynolds and Froude numbers. We find that, although the the pure jet-scaling law is not clearly observed in simulations at finite Froude number, the model correctly describe the transition to the buoyancy-dominated regime which emerges at long times.</description>

      <title>Theoretical estimate and characteristics of electro-vortex flows in cylindrical electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-vortex flows (EVF) arise in conducting fluids due to diverging current lines and the non-conservative Lorentz force. They are typically characterized by the $S$ parameter, defined as $S=\mu _0 I^2/4\pi^2 \rho \nu^2$, where it is known that $Re \sim \sqrt{S}$ for large currents. However, the strength of the EVF in a confined cylindrical domain with a co-axially placed current collector (CC) depends also on the ratio of the CC radius to the cylinder radius, $K=r_0/R$, in addition to the current magnitude, $I$, fluid density, $\rho$ and kinematic viscosity, $\nu$. For high $Re$, using the vorticity transport equation, we derive a new theoretical estimate of the r.m.s. EVF velocity and find that $u \propto I (1-K)/\sqrt{K}$. We validate our estimate with numerical simulations using our custom-built code in \textsc{OpenFOAM} for $K\in[0.1,0.7]$ and $I\in[30,555]$\SI{}{\A}. In addition, for the same range, we compare our numerical results with the estimates of maximum EVF velocity available in the literature. We also discuss the EVF characteristics for varying $K$ using the vorticity dynamics. Finally, we also propose a \emph{modified} EVF parameter ($S_M \propto S (1-K)^2/{K}$) based on our velocity estimate that includes $K$. Our results suggest that the scaling relationship should actually be $Re \sim \sqrt{S_M}$.</description>

      <title>A computational fluid dynamics model for the simulation of flashboiling flow inside pressurized metered dose inhalers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present, for the first time, a computational fluid dynamics tool for the simulation of the metered discharge in a pressurized metered dose inhaler. The model, based on open-source software, adopts the Volume-Of-Fluid method for the representation of the multiphase flow inside the device and a cavitation model to explicitly account for the onset of flashboiling upon actuation. Experimental visualizations of the flow inside the device and measurements of the mixture density and liquid and vapor flow rates at the nozzle orifice are employed to validate the model and assess the sensitivity of numerical results to modeling parameters. The results obtained for a standard device geometry show that the model is able to quantitatively predict several aspects of the dynamics and thermodynamics of the metered discharge. We conclude by showing how, by allowing to reproduce and understand the fluid dynamics upstream of the atomizing nozzle, our computational tool enables systematic design and optimization of the actuator geometry.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Experimental Evaluation of Chip Evacuation and Lubricant Flow using Optimized Drill Heads for Ejector Deep Hole Drilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ejector deep hole drilling offers great potential to utilize the typical advantages of deep hole drilling processes on conventional machining centers in a cost-effective and resource-efficient manner. However, maintaining reliable chip evacuation and stable process conditions often relies on high flow volumes of metalworking fluid, resulting in considerable energy consumption in industrial settings. Therefore, to analyze the highly sophisticated chip evacuation dynamics of the process, two flow-optimized drill heads and a reference drill head were evaluated with smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation using experimentally obtained chip shapes. In addition, modified drill heads were additively manufactured and experimentally investigated to validate the numerical results and to determine the positive effect on the necessary fluid flow for a stable ejector drilling process. The modifications aim to improve chip evacuation by reducing vortex formation and optimizing flow conditions near the cutting zone. Therefore, the minimum volume flow required for a stable drilling process without chip clogging is reduced, leading to an energy-efficient sustainable ejector drilling process.</description>

      <title>A robust intermittency equation formulation for transition modeling in Spalart-Allmaras RANS simulations of airfoil flows across a wide range of Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new robust formulation for local correlation-based laminar-to-turbulent transition models. This mechanism is incorporated into Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, coupled with the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model, considering both $\gamma$ and $\gamma$-${\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}_{\theta,t}}$ transition frameworks. In this context, special attention is placed on numerical stabilization of the $\gamma$ transport equation, which is identified as the root cause of instabilities observed in both $\gamma$ and $\gamma$-${\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}_{\theta,t}}$ based models. To this end, the intermittency equation is reformulated in logarithmic form and further stabilized through an energy--based limiting to bound excessively high positive values. In order to suppress unphysical pressure oscillations in the transition region, a gradient--driven artificial viscosity is also introduced. Additionally, the SA equation is augmented with strain--rate modulated production and rotation correction terms. The presented approach has demonstrated consistent effectiveness and robustness in the simulation of flow fields around airfoils over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, making it suitable for practical aerodynamic design applications.</description>

      <title>The role of Lagrangian drift in the generation of surface waves by wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear stability analysis entirely in the Lagrangian frame is conducted, revealing the fundamental role of the wave-induced mean flow in modifying further wave growth and providing new insight into the classic problem of wave generation by wind. The prevailing theory, a critical-layer resonance mechanism proposed by Miles (1957), has seen numerous refinements; yet, the role of Lagrangian drift -- the velocity a fluid parcel actually experiences -- in wave growth was not understood. Our analysis first recovers the classic Miles growth rate from linear theory before extending it to third order in the wave slope to derive a modified growth rate. The leading-order wave-induced mean flow alters the higher-order instability, manifesting as a suppression of growth with increasing wave steepness for the realistic wind profiles considered. This result is qualitatively consistent with observations. An integral momentum budget suggests that the wave-induced current alters the coupling between the total phase speed and the total Lagrangian mean flow at the critical level (as defined in the linear theory), thereby reducing the efficiency of momentum transfer. Notably, this Lagrangian drift is precisely what Doppler-shift based remote sensing of upper ocean currents measure, providing a direct observational pathway to account for this wave-induced feedback in studies of air-sea coupling. More broadly, this approach provides a new methodology for analyzing shear instabilities in general and a direct path towards refining wind-stress parameterizations.</description>

      <title>A Residual Guided strategy with Generative Adversarial Networks in training Physics-Informed Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network Approaches for Sparse Data Flow Reconstruction of Unsteady Flow Around Complex Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the flow field for a highly turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Dissipation concentration in two-dimensional fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dissipation measure arising in the inviscid limit of two-dimensional incompressible fluids. For Leray-Hopf solutions it is proved that the dissipation is Lebesgue in time and, for almost every time, it is absolutely continuous with respect to the defect measure of strong compactness of the solutions. When the initial vorticity is a measure, the dissipation is proved to be absolutely continuous with respect to a suitable "quadratic" space-time vorticity measure. This results into the trivial measure if the initial vorticity has singular part of distinguished sign, or a spatially purely atomic measure if wild oscillations in time are ruled out. In fact, the dynamics at the Kolmogorov scale is the only relevant one, in turn offering new criteria for anomalous dissipation. We provide kinematic examples highlighting the strengths and the limitations of our approach. Quantitative rates, dissipation life-span and steady fluids are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Confinement geometry governs the impact of external shear stress on active stress-driven flows in microtubule-kinesin active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active fluids generate internal active stress and exhibit unique responses to external forces such as superfluidity and self-yielding transitions. However, how confinement geometry influences these responses remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate microtubule-kinesin active fluids under external shear stresses in two geometries. In slab-like confinement (a narrow-gap cavity), external stresses propagated throughout the system, leading to stress competition and a kinematic transition that shifted dynamics from active stress-dominated to shear stress-dominated flow. At the transition, we estimate the active stress to be ~1.5 mPa. Simulation supported that this transition arises from stress competition. In contrast, in ring-like confinement (a toroidal system), external forces acted locally, inducing a mini cavity flow that triggered self-organized reconfiguration rather than direct entrainment. These findings show that the response of active fluids to external forcing depends not only on the magnitude of the applied stress but also on how confinement geometry directs and redistributes that stress, revealing a new approach to controlling active fluid behavior by combining static geometrical design with dynamic external stimuli for real-time modulation of flow patterns. Such control strategies may be applied to microfluidic systems, where external inputs such as micromechanical actuators can dynamically tune active fluid behavior within fixed device geometries, enabling transitions between chaotic and coherent flows for tasks such as mixing, sorting, or directed transport.</description>

      <title>FluidFormer: Transformer with Continuous Convolution for Particle-based Fluid Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based fluid simulation networks have been proven as viable alternatives to traditional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations. Existing neural methods follow Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) frameworks, which inherently rely only on local inter-particle interactions. However, we emphasize that global context integration is also essential for learning-based methods to stabilize complex fluid simulations. We propose the first Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where continuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures global dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models long-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer architecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly integrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new paradigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local features with attention-based global context modeling. FluidFormer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with stronger stability in complex fluid scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficient solutions of eigenvalue problems in rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear stability analysis of the Boltzmann kinetic equation has recently garnered research interest due to its potential applications in space exploration, where rarefaction effects can render the Navier Stokes equations invalid. Since the Boltzmann equation is defined in a seven-dimensional phase space, directly solving the associated eigenvalue problems is computationally intractable. In this paper, we propose an efficient iterative method to solve the linear stability equation of the kinetic equation. The solution process involves both outer and inner iterations. In the outer iteration, the shifted inverse power method is employed to compute selected eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions of interest. For the inner iteration, which involves inverting the high-dimensional system for the velocity distribution function, we adopt our recently developed general synthetic iterative scheme to ensure fast converging and asymptotic preserving properties. As a proof of concept, our method demonstrates both high efficiency and accuracy in planar sound wave and Couette flow. Each eigenpair can be computed with only a few hundred iterations of the kinetic equation, and the spatial cell size can be significantly larger than the molecular mean free path in near-continuum flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Fully implicit timestepping methods for the rotating shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</description>

      <title>On the Threshold of Drop Fragmentation under Impulsive Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secondary fragmentation of an impulsively accelerated drop depends on fluid properties and velocity of the ambient. The critical Weber number $(\mathit{We}_{cr})$, the minimum Weber number at which a drop undergoes non-vibrational breakup, depends on density ratio $(\rho)$, the drop $(\mathit{Oh}_d)$, and the ambient $(\mathit{Oh}_o)$ Ohnesorge numbers. The current study uses VoF based interface-tracking multiphase flow simulations to quantify the effect of different non-dimensional groups on the threshold at which secondary fragmentation occur. For $\mathit{Oh}_d \leq 0.1$, a decrease in $\mathit{Oh}_d$ was found to significantly influence the breakup morphology, plume formation, and $\mathit{We}_{cr}$. The balance between the pressure difference between the poles and the periphery, and the shear stresses on the upstream surface, was found to be controlled by $\rho$ and $\mathit{Oh}_o$. These forces induce flow inside the initially spherical drop, resulting in deformation into pancakes and eventually the breakup morphology of forward/backward bag. The evolution pathways of the drop morphology based on their non-dimensional groups have been charted. With inclusion of the data from the expanded parameter-space, the traditional $\mathit{We}_{cr}-\mathit{Oh}_d$ diagram used to illustrate the dependence of critical Weber number on $\mathit{Oh}_d$, was found to be inadequate in predicting the minimum initial $\mathit{We}$ required to undergo fragmentation. A new non-dimensional parameter $C_{breakup}$ is derived based on the competition between the forces driving the drop deformation and the forces resisting the drop deformation. Tested using available experimental data and current simulations, $C_{breakup}$ is found to be a robust predictor for the threshold of drop fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Realizability-Informed Machine Learning for Turbulence Anisotropy Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others. Moreover, as part of this study, we explore the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to turbulence modeling, assessing its potential to address non-linear mappings in the anisotropy tensor predictions and demonstrating promising results for the flat plate case.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</description>

Abstract: Classical solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations of an ideal incompressible fluid conserve the helicity. We introduce a new weak formulation of the vorticity formulation of the Euler equations in which (by implementing the Bony paradifferential calculus) the advection terms are interpreted as paraproducts for weak solutions with low regularity. Using this approach we establish an equation of local helicity balance, which gives a rigorous foundation to the concept of local helicity density and flux at low regularity. We provide a sufficient criterion for helicity conservation which is weaker than many of the existing sufficient criteria for helicity conservation in the literature.
  Subsequently, we prove a sufficient condition for the helicity to be conserved in the zero viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, we establish a relation between the defect measure (which is part of the local helicity balance) and a third-order structure function for solutions of the Euler equations. As a byproduct of the approach introduced in this paper, we also obtain a new sufficient condition for the conservation of magnetic helicity in the inviscid MHD equations, as well as for the kinematic dynamo model.
  Finally, it is known that classical solutions of the ideal (inviscid) MHD equations which have divergence-free initial data will remain divergence-free, but this need not hold for weak solutions. We show that weak solutions of the ideal MHD equations arising as weak-$*$ limits of Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the viscous and resistive MHD equations remain divergence-free in time.</description>

      <title>Observational causality by states and interaction type for scientific discovery</title>

Abstract: Causality plays a central role in understanding interactions between variables in complex systems. These systems often exhibit state-dependent causal relationships, where both the strength and direction of causality vary with the value of the interacting variables. In this work, we introduce a state-aware causal inference method that quantifies causality in terms of information gain about future states. The effectiveness of the proposed approach stems from two key features: its ability to characterize causal influence as a function of system state, and its capacity to distinguish between redundant and synergistic interactions. The method is validated across a range of benchmark cases in which the direction and strength of causality evolve in a prescribed manner with the state of the system. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach in two real scenarios: the interaction between motions across scales in a turbulent boundary layer, and the Walker circulation phenomenon in tropical Pacific climate dynamics. Our results show that, without accounting for state-dependent causality as well as redundant and synergistic effects, traditional approaches to causal inference may lead to incomplete or misleading conclusions.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06073</link>

Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</description>
