      <title>i-PI 3.0: a flexible, efficient framework for advanced atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-scale simulations have progressed tremendously over the past decade, largely due to the availability of interatomic potentials based on machine-learning algorithms. These potentials enable the combination of the accuracy of electronic structure calculations with extensive length and time scales. In this paper, we present a new release of the i-PI code that allows the community to fully benefit from the rapid developments in the field. i-PI is a Python software that facilitates the integration of different methods and different software tools by using a socket interface for inter-process communication. The current framework is flexible enough to support rapid prototyping and the combination of various simulation techniques, while maintaining a speed that prevents it from becoming the bottleneck in most workflows. We discuss the implementation of several new features, including an efficient algorithm to model bosonic and fermionic exchange, a framework for uncertainty quantification to be used in conjunction with machine-learning potentials, a communication infrastructure that allows deeper integration with electronic-driven simulations, and an approach to simulate coupled photon-nuclear dynamics in optical or plasmonic cavities. For this release, we also improved some computational bottlenecks of the implementation, reducing the overhead associated with using i-PI over a native implementation of molecular dynamics techniques. We show numerical benchmarks using widely adopted machine learning potentials, such as Behler-Parinello, DeepMD and MACE neural networks, and demonstrate that such overhead is negligible for systems containing between 100 and 12000 atoms.</description>

      <title>X-ray Coulomb explosion imaging reveals role of molecular structure in internal conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular photoabsorption results in an electronic excitation/ionization which couples to the rearrangement of the nuclei. The resulting intertwined change of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom determines the conversion of photoenergy into other molecular energy forms. Nucleobases are excellent candidates for studying such dynamics, and great effort has been taken in the past to observe the electronic changes induced by the initial excitation in a time-resolved manner using ultrafast electron spectroscopy. The linked geometrical changes during nucleobase photorelaxation have so far not been observed directly in time-resolved experiments. Here, we present a study on a thionucleobase, where we extract comprehensive information on the molecular rearrangement using Coulomb explosion imaging. Our measurement links the extracted deplanarization of the molecular geometry to the previously studied temporal evolution of the electronic properties of the system. In particular, the protons of the exploded molecule are well-suited messengers carrying rich information on the molecule's geometry at distinct times after the initial electronic excitation. The combination of ultrashort laser pulses to trigger molecular dynamics, intense X-ray free-electron laser pulses for the explosion of the molecule, and multi-particle coincidence detection opens new avenues for time-resolved studies of complex molecules in the gas phase.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-driven substitution of 4 mercaptophenylboronic acid to 4-nitrothiophenol monitored by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmon-driven reactions on plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) occur under significantly different conditions from those of classical organic synthesis and provide a promising pathway for enhancing the efficiency of various chemical processes. However, these reactions can also have undesirable effects, such as 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) deboronation. MPBA chemisorbs well to Ag NPs through its thiol group and can subsequently bind to diols, enabling the detection of various biological structures by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), but not upon its deboronation. To avoid this reaction, we investigated the experimental conditions of MPBA deboronation on Ag NPs by SERS. Our results showed that the level of deboronation strongly depends on both the morphology of the system and the excitation laser wavelength and power. In addition, we detected not only the expected products, namely thiophenol and biphenyl-4,4-dithiol, but also 4-nitrothiophenol (NTP). The crucial reagent for NTP formation was an oxidation product of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, the reduction agent used in Ag NP synthesis. Ultimately, this reaction was replicated by adding NaNO2 to the system, and its progress was monitored as a function of the laser power, thereby identifying a new reaction of plasmon-driven -B(OH)2 substitution for -NO2.</description>

      <title>Syngas conversion to higher alcohols via wood-framed Cu/Co-carbon catalyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Syngas conversion into higher alcohols represents a promising avenue for transforming coal or biomass into liquid fuels. However, the commercialization of this process has been hindered by the high cost, low activity, and inadequate C$_{2+}$OH selectivity of catalysts. Herein, we have developed Cu/Co carbon wood catalysts, offering a cost-effective and stable alternative with exceptional selectivity for catalytic conversion. The formation of Cu/Co nanoparticles was found, influenced by water-1,2-propylene glycol ratios in the solution, resulting in bidisperse nanoparticles. The catalyst exhibited a remarkable CO conversion rate of 74.8% and a selectivity of 58.7% for C$_{2+}$OH, primarily comprising linear primary alcohols. This catalyst demonstrated enduring stability and selectivity under industrial conditions, maintaining its efficacy for up to 350 h of operation. We also employed density functional theory (DFT) to analyze selectivity, particularly focusing on the binding strength of CO, a crucial precursor for subsequent reactions leading to the formation of CH$_3$OH. DFT identified the pathway of CH$_x$ and CO coupling, ultimately yielding C$_2$H$_5$OH. This computational understanding, coupled with high performance of the Cu/Co-carbon wood catalyst, paves ways for the development of catalytically selective materials tailored for higher alcohols production, thereby ushering in new possibility in this field.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of K$\beta$ mainline X-ray emission to structural dynamics in iron photosensitizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photochemistry and photophysics processes involve structures far from equilibrium. In these reactions, there is often strong coupling between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. For first-row transition metals, K$\beta$ X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) is a sensitive probe of electronic structure due to the direct overlap between the valence orbitals and the 3p hole in the final state. Here the sensitivity of K$\beta$ mainline (K$\beta$1,3) XES to structural dynamics is analyzed by simulating spectral changes along the excited state dynamics of an iron photosensitizer [FeII(bmip)2]2+ [bmip = 2,6-bis(3-methyl-imidazole-1-ylidine)-pyridine], using both restricted active space (RAS) multiconfigurational wavefunction theory and a one-electron orbital-energy approach in density-functional theory (1-DFT). Both methods predict a spectral blue-shift with increasing metal-ligand distance, which changes the emission intensity for any given detection energy. These results support the suggestion that the [FeII(bmip)2]2+ femtosecond K$\beta$ XES signal shows oscillations due to coherent wavepacket dynamics. Based on the RAS results, the sensitivity to structural dynamics is twice as high for K$\beta$ compared to K$\alpha$, with the drawback of a lower signal-to-noise ratio. K$\beta$ sensitivity is favored by a larger spectral blue-shift with increasing metal-ligand distance and larger changes in spectral shape. Comparing the two simulations methods, 1-DFT predicts smaller energy shifts and lower sensitivity, likely due to missing final-state effects. The simulations can be used to design and interpret XES probes of non-equilibrium structures to gain mechanistic insights in photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Short range order and topology of Te-rich amorphous Ge-Sb-Te alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of evaporated amorphous Ge$_x$Sb$_x$Te$_{100-2x}$ ($x =$ 6, 9, 13) alloys was investigated by neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) at the Ge, Sb and Te K-edges. Large scale structural models were generated by fitting the experimental datasets (5 for each composition) simultaneously in the framework of the reverse Monte Carlo simulation technique. It was found that the alloys are chemically ordered (Ge and Sb have predominantly Te neighbors) and within the experimental uncertainty each component satisfies the $8-N$ rule. A comparison with the pair correlation functions of melt quenched Ge$_{20}$Te$_{80}$ revealed that the first minimum of $g_{\mathrm{TeTe}}(r)$ is shallower in the ternary alloys than in Ge$_{20}$Te$_{80}$. On the other hand, the separation of the first and second coordination environments of Ge atoms is stronger in the Ge-Sb-Te alloys investigated.</description>

      <title>Quantum-centric strong and dynamical electron correlation: A resource-efficient second-order $N$-electron valence perturbation theory formulation for near-term quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement-cost efficient implementation of Strongly-Contracted $N$-Electron Valence Perturbation Theory (SC-NEVPT2) for use on near-term quantum devices. At the heart of our algorithm we exploit the properties of adaptive Informationally Complete positive operator valued measures (IC-POVMs) to recycle the measurement outcomes from a ground state energy estimation on a quantum device to reconstruct the matrix elements of the three- and four-body reduced density matrices for use in a subsequent CPU-driven NEVPT2 calculation. The proposed scheme is capable of producing results in good agreement with corresponding conventional NEVPT2 simulations, while significantly reducing the cost of quantum measurements and allowing for embarrassingly parallel estimations of higher-order RDMs in classical post-processing. Our scheme shows favourable scaling of the total number of shots with respect to system size. This paves the way for routine inclusion of dynamic electron correlation effects in hybrid quantum-classical computing pipelines.</description>

      <title>Spectral Maps for Learning Reduced Representations of Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating processes in complex molecular systems, which are characterized by many variables, is a crucial problem in computational physics. These systems can be reduced to a few meaningful degrees of freedom known as collective variables (CVs). However, identifying these CVs is a significant challenge, especially for systems with long-lived metastable states. This is because the information about the slow kinetics of rare transitions needs to be encoded in CVs. In this talk, we review recent advances in learning slow CVs and focus mainly on our spectral map technique, a promising deep-learning method that learns CVs based on the slowest timescales. By maximizing the spectral gap between slow and fast eigenvalues of a Markov transition matrix constructed from simulation data, our method effectively captures a simplified representation of alanine dipeptide in solvent. This practical application of our method demonstrates its ability to extract slow CVs, making it a valuable tool for analyzing complex systems.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Sampling using Smooth Basin Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of atomic simulations of materials and molecules can rapidly deteriorate when large free energy barriers exist between local minima. We propose smooth basin classification, a universal method to define reaction coordinates based on the internal feature representation of a graph neural network. We achieve high data efficiency by exploiting their built-in symmetry and adopting a transfer learning strategy. We benchmark our approach on challenging chemical and physical transformations, and show that it matches and even outperforms reaction coordinates defined based on human intuition.</description>

      <title>Conditional Normalizing Flows for Active Learning of Coarse-Grained Molecular Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient sampling of the Boltzmann distribution of molecular systems is a long-standing challenge. Recently, instead of generating long molecular dynamics simulations, generative machine learning methods such as normalizing flows have been used to learn the Boltzmann distribution directly, without samples. However, this approach is susceptible to mode collapse and thus often does not explore the full configurational space. In this work, we address this challenge by separating the problem into two levels, the fine-grained and coarse-grained degrees of freedom. A normalizing flow conditioned on the coarse-grained space yields a probabilistic connection between the two levels. To explore the configurational space, we employ coarse-grained simulations with active learning which allows us to update the flow and make all-atom potential energy evaluations only when necessary. Using alanine dipeptide as an example, we show that our methods obtain a speedup to molecular dynamics simulations of approximately 15.9 to 216.2 compared to the speedup of 4.5 of the current state-of-the-art machine learning approach.</description>
