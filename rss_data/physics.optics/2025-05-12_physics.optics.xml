      <title>On-chip Non-Hermitian Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) promise revolutionary control over quantum light-matter interactions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate flexible and reversible engineering of quantum vacuum fluctuation in an integrated microcavity supporting chiral Eps. We develop a hybrid lithium niobate (LN)-GaAs quantum photonic platform, seamlessly combining high-quality quantum emitters, a low-loss photonic circuit, efficient electro-optic (EO) effect, and local strain actuator in a single device. Chiral EPs are implemented by dynamically tuning the coupling between the modes associated with a micro-ring resonator, resulting in anomalous spontaneous emission dynamic with a 7-fold modulation of the lifetime (120 ps to 850 ps). Meanwhile, we reshape single-photon spectra via cavity local density of states (LDOS) engineering and generate non-Lorentzian spectral profiles: squared-Lorentzian, Fano-like, and EP-induced transparency (EPIT), a suppression of emission at zero detuning. This work unveils exotic cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) effects unique to EPs and establishes a universal paradigm for non-Hermitian quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal mode-locked vector solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increased transverse mode degrees of freedom, spatiotemporal mode-locked (STML) fiber lasers exhibit more intricate and richer nonlinear dynamics, making them an ideal platform for studying complex nonlinear phenomena. However, current research mainly focuses on their scalar characteristics, leaving their vector characteristics unexplored. Here, we investigate the vector characteristics of the STML fiber laser and demonstrate two novel types of vector solitons associated with transverse modes, namely the STML polarization-locked vector soliton (PLVS) and the STML group velocity-locked vector soliton (GVLVS). In both types of STML vector solitons, the two polarization modes exhibit distinct transverse mode compositions and relative power ratios. However, the two polarization modes share identical peak wavelengths in STML PLVSs, while they have different peak wavelengths in STML GVLVSs. Notably, during the soliton splitting process of the STML GVLVSs, polarization-dependent phenomena, including the gain competition and variation of the peak wavelength difference between polarization modes as well as the invisible periodic variation in the beam profile, are observed. The formation of STML vector solitons demonstrates that soliton trapping remains a universal phenomenon for vector solitons even in the more intricate STML fiber lasers, and the obtained results reveal the vector characteristics of STML fiber lasers, enhancing the understanding of their nonlinear phenomena.</description>

      <title>Tunable hinge skin states in a hybrid skin-topological sonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological states in sound have played a pivotal role in understanding the intricate physics underlying sound transport, giving rise to new strategy of manipulating sound. Here we report tunable structure for hinge skin states in a non-Hermitian acoustic metamaterial with hybrid skin-topological effect. Our finding shows that when on-site gain and loss are exquisitely introduced into acoustic topological insulators, chiral edge modes in Hermitian counterpart would respectively become amplified or attenuated at zigzag boundaries. If adjacent gain and loss boundaries are intentionally constructed, hinge skin states would take place at their intersections. By strategically combining non-Hermitian and topological physics, we successfully reveal how higher-order hinge modes originate from lower-order surface states and demonstrate flexible acoustic steering in tunable non-Hermitian blocks. Our findings unveil that skin-topological effect may hold significant applications in designing interesting acoustic devices with unconventional functions such as multidimensional acoustic control and accurate energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Narrowband, angle-stable, and highly efficient polariton organic light emitting diodes employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06057v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrowband emission is crucial for next generation optoelectronic devices to satisfy demands for high color brilliance. Microcavities can narrow emission spectra of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) through the creation of resonant standing waves, independent of emitter material, enabling flexibility in molecular and device design. However, they induce a strong angle-dependence of the perceived emission color. Utilizing strong light-matter coupling of cavity photons with the virtually angle-independent exciton, leads to exciton-polariton emission showing reduced linewidths and suppressed angular dispersion if tuned correctly. Creating polaritons in highly efficient materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is however difficult as their low oscillator strengths intrinsically disfavor light-matter interaction. Here, we present the successful combination of a highly efficient but intrinsically broadband TADF emitter with a strongly absorbing assistant strong coupling material in a modified microcavity structure. Through optimizing the assistant strong coupling layer architecture, we demonstrate polariton OLEDs with exceptionally narrowband, angle stable emission at external quantum efficiencies above 20% for both bottom- and top-emitting designs, more than doubling the performance of previous record devices. The results pave the way for utilizing polaritonic emission at practical device efficiencies for display applications.</description>

      <title>Methodology for Topological Interface Engineering in 2D Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonics provides a robust and flexible platform for controlling light, enabling functionalities such as backscattering-immune edge transport and slow-light propagation. In this work, we design and characterize photonic topological interfaces in two-dimensional photonic crystals. We introduce an iterative band connection algorithm that preserves mode symmetry and present a general framework for band symmetry recognition, essential for identifying Z2 topological phases. Design strategies for unit cell geometries are developed to achieve targeted band inversions, overlapping bandgaps, and tailored dispersions. Furthermore, the approach can be readily adapted to specific material platforms and operating wavelengths, including the telecommunication range, by appropriately scaling the lattice parameter as long as absorption remains low. We investigate the trade-off between bandgap size and band flatness, identifying exceptions governed by lattice geometry. Additionally, we demonstrate how photonic crystal periodicity influences the stability of topological modes and enhances unidirectional energy transport.</description>

      <title>Frequency Range Boosted Magnetometry Beyond the Spin Coherence Limit via Compressive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free induction decay (FID) of spin precession serves as an essential tool for quantum sensing across diverse platforms. While extending spin coherence time remains critical for sensitivity enhancement, the requisite long single-shot acquisitions narrow the resolvable frequency range, establishing a fundamental ``spin coherence limit (SCL)'', according to the Nyquist Sampling Theorem. Besides, conventional spectral analysis for FID measurement suffers from frequency alias, causing signal attenuation and positional errors that compromise the measurement validity. Here, we demonstrate a general frequency-range-extended technique that overcomes SCL by leveraging compressive sensing. By applying this method to the FID magnetometer, we expand the resolvable frequency range significantly from the Nyquist-limited range of 251\,Hz to 3000\,Hz, effectively avoiding frequency alias. Our work paves the way for implementing long-coherence-time spin systems in high-sensitivity, broad-bandwidth, and alias-free magnetic field sensing.</description>

      <title>Subjective nature of path information in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common sense suggests that a particle must have a definite origin if its full path information is available. In quantum mechanics, the knowledge of path information is captured through the well-established duality relation between path distinguishability and interference visibility. If visibility is zero, a high path distinguishability can be obtained, which enables one with high predictive power to know where the particle comes from. Here we show that this perception of path information is problematic. We demonstrate the simultaneous observation of zero interference visibility and the complete absence of which-path information using a three-crystal interference setup. With a contradictory argument by grouping the crystals in different ways, we show that it is impossible to ascribe a definite physical origin to the photon pair even if the emission probability of one individual source is zero and full path information is available. Our findings shed new light on the physical interpretation of probability assignment and path information beyond its mathematical meaning and reshape our understanding of the whole and part in the context of distinguishability.</description>

      <title>Synthetic gauge field enabled realization of bulk- and edge-transported states in an aperiodic acoustic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states with immunity against various disorders have been implemented in a variety of topological insulators. In this Letter, we reveal that Landau levels in aperiodic acoustic structures can be achieved under different pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs). The produced zero order Landau modes (ZOLMs) could transmit along the channels at the interior or exterior of the inhomogeneous array, which are separately termed as "bulk-transported states" (BTSs) and "edge-transported states" (ETSs). Distinct from conventional valley edge states, the ZOLMs show intriguing self-collimation feature. If a pseudoelectric field (PEF) is further included, the combination of a PMF and PEF can result in the formation of bulk or edge Landau rainbow, where Landau zero modes are distributed at various positions of the bulk or boundary of the sample at different frequencies. The synthetic-gauge-field-controlled topological states can enable fully control of robust transmission, and using the entire footprint of a topological lattice. Our findings not only profoundly advance the current understanding of topological phase matter but also offer new avenues for constructing topological acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of Perfect Absorption in Hyperfine Levels of Molecular Spins with Hermitian Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ideal effective parity-time (PT)-symmetry can be achieved in a passive open system by accurately balancing feeding and absorption processes. Such PT-symmetric systems display Hermitian subspaces which enable perfect absorption (PA) of radiation, i.e., all the incoming energy is absorbed by the system. In this work, we consider a passive open quantum system obtained by coupling molecular spin centers to a planar microwave resonator operating at milliKelvin temperatures and at few-photon power level. We experimentally demonstrate that Hermitian subspaces and thus PA can be implemented even in the absence of PT-symmetry, by exploiting the spin detuning to control the photon and spin content of a polariton mode. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and significantly enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how Hermitian subspaces can be potentially exploited for the development of efficient switches and modulators with high modulation depths over a broad spectral range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A polymer shell offers a unique opportunity to tailor structural and optical properties of optically functional nanoparticles and their ensembles. Here, we develop a process to coat Mie-resonant silicon nanospheres (Si NSs) with a thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel shell. We show formation of a PNIPAM shell of controlled thickness from the change of the hydrodynamic diameter and study the effect of thermoresponsive shrinkage and expansion of the shell on the Mie resonance of a Si NS. We then demonstrate that Si NSs with PNIPAM shells enable fabrication of cluster-free, self-assembled monolayers of Si NSs, in which distances between NSs are controlled by the PNIPAM shell thickness.</description>

      <title>Temporal Effective Medium for Programmable Acoustic Metamaterials with Multiple Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend effective medium theory (EMT) to time-modulated, frequency-dispersive acoustic metamaterials with multiple resonances. While previous studies focused on non-dispersive or single-resonance systems, advances in programmable materials now enable precise control of time-varying responses. We derive explicit averaging rules that account for the interplay between resonant and modulation frequencies. When resonant frequencies are much lower than the modulation frequency, modulating the resonant strength yields the temporal average of monopolar susceptibility \c{hi}, while modulating the resonant frequency results in the average of 1/\c{hi}, applied per resonance mode. In hybrid cases, high-frequency resonances (relative to modulation) can be renormalized as a non-dispersive background before averaging the rest. This generalized temporal EMT offers a unified framework for designing compact, topologically robust, and non-Hermitian acoustic devices, leveraging the possible programmability of time-dependent material parameters in future.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spin dynamics after dual optical excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort optical pulses are a cornerstone for manipulating electronic and magnetic states in materials on a femtosecond timescale. Conventional models assume that optical excitation primarily modifies the occupation of the electron energy levels without long-lasting altering of the coupling of individual electrons in certain processes. Here, we demonstrate that optical excitation with two femtosecond pulses that come from different directions fundamentally transforms the electron dynamics in copper, affecting the efficiency of angular momentum transfer between electrons and the lattice. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, we reveal a ~2.5. increase in spin imbalance decay time following inverse Faraday effect excitation under dual-pump conditions compared to single-pulse excitation. This observation challenges the prevailing paradigm of ultrafast light-matter interactions, showing that dual optical excitation can transiently modify electron dynamics beyond simple changes in the energy levels occupancy. Our findings open new avenues for controlling quantum states through a dual pump approach, with implications for ultrafast spintronics and the design of novel light-driven states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that a few-period circular Bragg reflector around an infinite nanowire can increase the $\beta$ factor of the fundamental mode up to 0.999 due to further suppression of the emission into radiation modes caused by a photonic band gap effect. We then apply this strategy in the practically relevant case of the finite-sized SPS based on tapered nanowires and demonstrate that the collection efficiency can be further increased. Additionally, we also show the beneficial effects of adding optimized high-index rings around the micropillar SPS.</description>

      <title>Speckle-Driven Single-Shot Orbital Angular Momentum Recognition with Ultra-Low Sampling Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) recognition of vortex beams is critical for applications ranging from optical communications to quantum technologies. However, conventional approaches designed for free-space propagation struggle when vortex beams propagate within or through scattering media, such as multimode fibers (MMF), and often rely on high-resolution imaging sensors with tens of thousands of pixels to record dense intensity profiles. Here, we introduce a speckle-driven OAM recognition technique that exploits the intrinsic correlation between speckle patterns and OAM states, circumventing the limitations of scattering media while drastically reducing sampling requirements. Our method, termed spatially multiplexed points detection (SMPD), extracts intensity information from spatially distributed points in a multiplexed speckle plane. Remarkably, it achieves &gt;99% retrieval accuracy for OAMs recognition using just 16 sampling points, corresponding to a sampling density of 0.024% -4096 times lower than conventional imaging-based approaches. Furthermore, high-capacity OAM-multiplexed communication decoding with an error rate of &lt;0.2% and handwritten digit recognition with an accuracy of 89% are implemented to verify the versatility of SMPD. This work transcends the trade-off between sampling density and accuracy, establishing a scalable platform for resource-efficient photonic applications like quantum communication and endoscopic sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical and wave properties of microlasers with the shape of a truncated pseudosphere are investigated through experiments and numerical simulations. These pseudosphere microlasers are surface-like organic microlasers with constant negative curvature, which were fabricated with high optical quality by direct laser writing. It is shown that they behave, in many ways, similar to two-dimensional flat disks, regardless of their different Gaussian curvature. We derive the monodromy matrices for geodesics on the pseudosphere and demonstrate that the periodic geodesics are marginally stable. Actually, due to the rotational symmetry, the pseudosphere is an integrable system.</description>

      <title>Optical Switching of $\chi^{(2)}$ in Diamond Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond's unique physical properties make it a versatile materials for a wide range of nonlinear and quantum photonic technologies. However, unlocking diamond's full potential as a nonlinear photonic material with non-zero second-order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}\neq0$ requires symmetry breaking. In this work, we use a nanoscale cavity to demonstrate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in diamond, and demonstrate, for the first time, that the magnitude of the diamond's effective $\chi^{(2)}$ strongly depends on the electronic configuration of defects in the diamond crystal, such as nitrogen vacancy centres. The modification of $\chi^{(2)}$ arises from photoionisation from the negative to neutral charge state, and is manifested by quenching of SHG upon green illumination. Toggling the green illumination allows for optical switching of the device's $\chi^{(2)}$. Optical control of $\chi^{(2)}$ by defect engineering opens the door for second-order nonlinear processes in diamond.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast and accurate multimode waveguide design based on dataset-based eigenmode expansion method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dataset-based photonic simulation framework for multimode waveguide design, enabling ultra-fast simulations with high accuracy. Compared to conventional approaches, our method offers two to three orders of magnitude speed-up in complex multimode waveguide designs. Based on this approach, we demonstrate a silicon multimode waveguide bend with an effective radius of $30\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ under one second, with accuracy validated against commercial 3D finite-difference time-domain method. We further explore its utility for device optimization by designing a $20\,\mu \mathrm{m}$-radius, arbitrary power splitting ratio bends through thousands of optimization iterations, completed in just 68 minutes on a standard desktop CPU. This framework enables the rapid design and engineering of large-scale multimode photonic devices, making computationally intensive simulations more accessible to many photonic circuit designers.</description>

      <title>Back-illumination interference tomography for imaging weak scattering in thick tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological tissues are composed of discrete compartments of biochemical media that often exhibit subtle differences in refractive index. Light propagating through these compartments partially diffracts in a forward direction with a pi/2 phase shift. We introduce a microscopy technique to image this scattering signal in thick tissues, called back-illumination interference tomography (BIT). An incoherent source is demagnified and imaged past the focal plane of a high numerical aperture objective lens, producing a small, semicoherent source of backscattered light. This backscattered light undergoes a phase inversion over the narrow depth of field of the microscope, providing interference contrast to weakly scattering objects at the focal plane. BIT offers a fundamentally different source of contrast to conventional illumination and oblique back-illumination microscopy. Compared to these techniques, we show that BIT improves contrast to blood cells in vitro in microfluidic chambers and in vivo in a human capillary. Finally, we apply BIT to unstained, unlabeled bulk human tissue ex vivo and compare side-by-side to adjacent frozen sections stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. These results demonstrate the potential of BIT to provide high resolution, high speed, 3D imaging of unprocessed biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Angular Scattering of Substrated Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properly modeling and predicting the scattering response of a metasurface is a particularly challenging task. This has been shown to be especially difficult if the metasurface supports both local and nonlocal interactions, in the form of lattice coupling effects, multipolar contributions or bianisotropic responses. So far, existing methods to approach this problem have been restricted to normal incidence in a homogeneous background medium. We overcome these limitations by providing a rigorous and comprehensive formalism that accommodates both oblique incidence and the presence of different superstrate and substrate. This is achieved by extending our existing metasurface modeling framework to account for nonlocal and multipolar contributions up to the octupolar order and properly accounting for the scattering effects due to an inhomogeneous background medium. Additionally, our method is based on exact spherical multipole decomposition, which intrinsically accounts for toroidal contributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by modeling the response of several dielectric and plasmonic metasurfaces that exhibit sharp spectral features including bound states in the continuum. Overall, our formalism yields excellent agreement with full-wave simulations.</description>

      <title>On-demand longitudinal transformations of light beams via an amplitude-phase-decoupled Pancharatnam-Berry phase element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overcoming the inherent phase-only modulation limitation of conventional Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) elements, we propose a checkerboard-encoded PB element that enables simultaneous amplitude and phase modulation through PB phase engineering. This single-element platform directly generates polarization-rotating beams with continuously varying polarization angles along the propagation axis, eliminating traditional dynamic phase requirements. By strategically combining the proposed element with a liquid crystal q-plate and waveplates, we demonstrate on-demand longitudinal transformations of polarization states and high-order Poincar\'e sphere beams. Significantly, we achieve, for the first time to our knowledge, the propagation-transformed optical skyrmions, whose topological textures evolve with propagation distance. This amplitude-phase decoupling mechanism and the integration solution for various longitudinal transformations open new avenues in structured light manipulation, particularly benefiting quantum optics and topological photonics applications requiring longitudinal mode control.</description>
