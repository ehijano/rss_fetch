      <title>Uniqueness and convergence of resistance forms on unconstrained Sierpinski carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness of self-similar $D_4$-symmetric resistance forms on unconstrained Sierpinski carpets ($\mathcal{USC}$'s). Moreover, on a sequence of $\mathcal{USC}$'s $K_n, n\geq 1$ converging in Hausdorff metric, we show that the associated diffusion processes converge in distribution if and only if the geodesic metrics on $K_n, n\geq 1$ are equicontinuous with respect to the Euclidean metric.</description>

      <title>Beyond chromatic threshold via $(p,q)$-theorem, and sharp blow-up phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel connection between the well-known chromatic threshold problem in extremal combinatorics and the celebrated $(p,q)$-theorem in discrete geometry. In particular, for a graph $G$ with bounded clique number and a natural density condition, we prove a $(p,q)$-theorem for an abstract convexity space associated with $G$. Our result strengthens those of Thomassen and Nikiforov on the chromatic threshold of cliques. Our $(p,q)$-theorem can also be viewed as a $\chi$-boundedness result for (what we call) ultra maximal $K_r$-free graphs.
  We further show that the graphs under study are blow-ups of constant size graphs, improving a result of Oberkampf and Schacht on homomorphism threshold of cliques. Our result unravels the cause underpinning such a blow-up phenomenon, differentiating the chromatic and homomorphism threshold problems for cliques. Our result implies that for the homomorphism threshold problem, rather than the minimum degree condition usually considered in the literature, the decisive factor is a clique density condition on co-neighborhoods of vertices. More precisely, we show that if an $n$-vertex $K_{r}$-free graph $G$ satisfies that the common neighborhood of every pair of non-adjacent vertices induces a subgraph with $K_{r-2}$-density at least $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then $G$ must be a blow-up of some $K_r$-free graph $F$ on at most $2^{O(\frac{r}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ vertices. Furthermore, this single exponential bound is optimal. We construct examples with no $K_r$-free homomorphic image of size smaller than $2^{\Omega_r(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$.</description>

      <title>Shortest closed curve to contain a sphere in its convex hull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in Euclidean 3-space any closed curve $\gamma$ which contains the unit sphere within its convex hull has length $L\geq4\pi$, and characterize the case of equality. This result generalizes the authors' recent solution to a conjecture of Zalgaller. Furthermore, for the analogous problem in $n$ dimensions, we include the estimate $L\geq Cn\sqrt{n}$ by Nazarov, which is sharp up to the constant $C$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic order of the quantization error for a class of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>
