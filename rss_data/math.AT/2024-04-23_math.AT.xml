      <title>Hopf algebras, Steinberg modules, and the unstable cohomology of $SL_n(\mathbb Z)$ and $GL_n(\mathbb Z)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the direct sum of all homology groups of the integral general linear groups with Steinberg module coefficients form a commutative Hopf algebra, in particular a free graded commutative algebra. We use this to construct new infinite families of unstable cohomology classes of $SL_n(\mathbb Z)$.</description>

      <title>Notes on Pointwise Finite-Dimensional $2$-Parameter Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study pointwise finite-dimensional (p.f.d.) $2$-parameter persistence modules where each module admits a finite convex isotopy subdivision. We show that a p.f.d. $2$-parameter persistence module $M$ (with a finite convex isotopy subdivision) is isomorphic to a $2$-parameter persistence module $N$ where the restriction of $N$ to each chamber of the parameter space $(\mathbb{R},\leq)^2$ is a constant functor. Moreover, we show that the convex isotopy subdivision of $M$ induces a finite encoding of $M$. Finally, we prove that every indecomposable thin $2$-parameter persistence module is isomorphic to a polytope module.</description>

      <title>Equivariant $K$-theory of cellular toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we describe the $T_{comp}$-equivariant topological
  $K$-ring of a $T$-{\it cellular} simplicial toric variety. We
  further show that $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ is isomorphic as an
  $R(T_{comp})$-algebra to the ring of piecewise Laurent polynomial
  functions on the associated fan denoted $PLP(\Delta)$. Furthermore,
  we compute a basis for $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ as a
  $R(T_{comp})$-module and multiplicative structure constants with
  respect to this basis.</description>

      <title>Definable (co)homology, pro-torus rigidity, and (co)homological classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the classical homology theory of Steenrod may be enriched with descriptive set-theoretic information. We prove that the resulting definable homology theory provides a strictly finer invariant than Steenrod homology for compact metrizable spaces up to homotopy. In particular, we show that pro-tori are completely classified up to homeomorphism by their definable homology. This is in contrast with the fact that, for example, there exist uncountably many pairwise non-homeomorphic solenoids with the same Steenrod homology groups. We similarly develop a definable cohomology theory which strengthens \v{C}ech cohomology and we show that it completely classifies complements of pro-tori up to homeomorphism.
  We also apply definable cohomology theory to the study of the space $\left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ of homotopy classes of continuous functions from a solenoid complement $X$ to the $2$-sphere, which was initiated by Borsuk and Eilenberg in 1936. It was proved by Eilenberg and Steenrod in 1940 that the space $\left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ is uncountable. We will strengthen this result, by showing that each orbit of the canonical action $\mathrm{Homeo}% \left( X\right) \curvearrowright \left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ is countable, and hence that such an action has uncountably many orbits. This can be seen as a rigidity result, and will be deduced from a rigidity result for definable automorphisms of the \v{C}ech cohomology of $X$. We will also show that these results still hold if one replaces solenoids with pro-tori.
  We conclude by applying the machinery developed herein to bound the Borel complexity of several well-studied classification problems in mathematics, such as that of automorphisms of continuous-trace $C^{*}$-algebras up to unitary equivalence, or that of Hermitian line bundles, up to isomorphism, over a locally compact second countable space.</description>

      <title>A double $(\infty,1)$-categorical nerve for double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.01848v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a nerve from double categories into double $(\infty,1)$-categories and show that it gives a right Quillen and homotopically fully faithful functor between the model structure for weakly horizontally invariant double categories and the model structure on bisimplicial spaces for double $(\infty,1)$-categories seen as double Segal objects in spaces complete in the horizontal direction. We then restrict the nerve along a homotopical horizontal embedding of 2-categories into double categories, and show that it gives a right Quillen and homotopically fully faithful functor between Lack's model structure for 2-categories and the model structure for 2-fold complete Segal spaces. We further show that Lack's model structure is right-induced along this nerve from the model structure for 2-fold complete Segal spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Smith-Thom deficiency of Hilbert squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an expression for the Smith-Thom deficiency of the Hilbert square $X^{[2]}$ of a smooth real algebraic variety $X$ in terms of the rank of a suitable Mayer-Vietoris mapping in several situations. As a consequence, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the maximality of $X^{[2]}$ in the case of projective complete intersections, and show that with a few exceptions no real nonsingular projective complete intersection of even dimension has maximal Hilbert square. We also provide new examples of smooth real algebraic varieties with maximal Hilbert square.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isomorphism of grid chain complexes for a connected sum of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely combinatorial proof of a K\"{u}nneth formula for the minus version of knot Floer homology of connected sums by constructing a quasi-isomorphism of grid chain complexes. The quasi-isomorphism naturally deduces that the Legendrian and transverse invariants behave functorially with respect to the connected sum operation.</description>

      <title>Homology and homotopy for arbitrary categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the prime motivation for topology was Homotopy theory, which captures the general idea of a continuous transformation between two entities, which may be spaces or maps. In later decades, an algebraic formulation of topology was discovered with the development of Homology theory. Some of the deepest results in topology are about the connections between Homotopy and Homology. These results are proved using intricate constructions. This paper takes an axiomatic approach that provides a common ground for homotopy and homology in arbitrary categories. The axioms have simple and natural motivations, and lead to the deeper connections between homotopy and homology.</description>
