      <title>The role of edge states for early-warning of tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tipping points (TP) are often described as low-dimensional bifurcations, and are associated with early-warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down (CSD). CSD is an increase in amplitude and correlation of noise-induced fluctuations away from a reference attractor as the TP is approached. But for high-dimensional systems it is not obvious which variables or observables would display the critical dynamics and carry CSD. Many variables may display no CSD, or show changes in variability not related to a TP. It is thus helpful to identify beforehand which observables are relevant for a given TP. Here we propose this may be achieved by knowledge of an unstable edge state that separates the reference from an alternative attractor that remains after the TP. This is because stochastic fluctuations away from the reference attractor are preferentially directed towards the edge state along a most likely path (the instanton). As the TP is approached the edge state and reference attractor typically become closer, and the fluctuations can evolve further along the instanton. This can be exploited to find observables with substantial CSD, which we demonstrate using conceptual dynamical systems models and climate model simulations of a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).</description>

      <title>Noise-induced peak intensity fluctuations in class B laser systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random perturbations and noise can excite instabilities in population systems that result in large fluctuations. An interesting example involves class B lasers, where the dynamics is determined by the number of carriers and photons in a cavity with noise appearing in the electric-field dynamics. When such lasers are brought above threshold, the field intensity grows away from an unstable equilibrium, exhibiting transient relaxation oscillations with fluctuations due to noise. In this work, we focus on the first peak in the intensity during this transient phase in the presence of noise, and calculate its probability distribution using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. In particular, we show how each value of the first peak is determined by a unique fluctuational-momentum, calculate the peak intensity distribution in the limit where the ratio of photon-to-carrier lifetimes is small, and analyze the behavior of small fluctuations with respect to deterministic theory. Our approach is easily extended to the analysis of transient, noise-induced large fluctuations in general population systems exhibiting relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Induced Nonlinear Spin Dynamics in an Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear effects are the root of interesting phenomena such as masers and lasers, and play a significant role in science and engineering. In spin systems, nonlinear spin dynamics is crucial for the prediction of complex dynamical behavior such as self-organizing oscillation, with applications ranging from spin masers and time crystals to precision measurement. However, when a spin system operates in a static magnetic field, how the inhomogeneity of the field affects its dynamics is a primary concern. Here we study the dynamics of a collection of spins with multiple Larmor frequencies for modeling a static inhomogeneous magnetic field, and reveal that due to the nonlinearity induced by a feedback scheme, the spin system exhibits much richer stable dynamical phases, including quasi-periodic orbits and chaos besides the usual limit cycles emerged in previous works. These phases are generally applicable to coupled nonlinear spin systems, even with more than two intrinsic Larmor frequencies or in continuum cases. Furthermore, we discuss their robustness against the experimental noises and the feasibility of realization in several spin systems. Our findings contribute to future observation of nonlinear dynamical phases and prospective applications in precision measurement.</description>
