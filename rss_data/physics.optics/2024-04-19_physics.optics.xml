      <title>Enhanced Robustness via Loss Engineering in Detuned Non-Hermitian Scattering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian optics has revealed a series of counterintuitive phenomena with profound implications for sensing, lasing, and light manipulation. While the non-Hermiticity of Hamitonians is well-recognized, recent advancements in non-Hermitian physics have broadened to include scattering matrices, uncovering phenomena such as simultaneous lasing and coherent perfect absorption (CPA), reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs), and coherent chaos control. Despite these developments, the investigation has predominantly focused on static and symmetric configurations, leaving the dynamic properties of non-Hermitian scattering in detuned systems largely unexplored. Bridging this gap, we extend certain stationary non-Hermitian scattering phenomena to detuned systems. We delve into the interplay between bi-directional RSMs and RSM exceptional points (EPs), and elucidate the global existence conditions for RSMs under detuning. Moreover, we introduces a novel category of EPs, characterized by the coalescence of transmission peaks, emerging independent with the presence of Hamiltonian EPs. The transmission EPs (TEPs) exhibit flat-top lineshape and can be extended to a square-shaped spectrum when detuning is involved, accompanied by a distinctive phase transition. Significantly, we demonstrate the applications of the TEPs in a one-dimensional coupled cavity system, engineered to enhance sensing robustness against environmental instabilities such as laser frequency drifts, which can exceed 10 MHz. This capability represents a substantial improvement over traditional sensing methods and an important improvement of fragile EP sensors. Our findings not only contribute to the broader understanding of non-Hermitian scattering phenomena but also paves the way for future advancements in non-Hermitian sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Controllable generation and spatial phase-modulation of vortex beams in cascade-type atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a four-level cascade-type atomic system in which two reverse four-wave mixing (FWM) processes can coexist via optical transitions in distinct pathways. This enables the generation of high- or low-frequency vortex beams on demand and facilitates spatial phase modulation of the vortex beam intensity distribution. The two reverse FWM processes can yield the sum-frequency vortex beam with high frequency and the difference-frequency vortex beam with low frequency, corresponding to frequency up-conversion and down-conversion, respectively. The closed-loop configuration's phase sensitivity allows for asymmetric phase modulation of the spatial distributions of the two output vortex beams. Additionally, increasing the phase enables spatial rotation of the output beams. Our proposed scheme holds promise for potential applications in quantum nonlinear optics and vortex exchange.</description>

      <title>The bandgap-detuned excitation regime in photonic-crystal resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of nonlinear interactions in microresonators enhances access to classical and quantum field states across nearly limitless bandwidth. A recent innovation has been to leverage coherent scattering of the intraresonator pump as a control of group-velocity dispersion and nonlinear frequency shifts, which are precursors for the dynamical evolution of new field states. A uniform periodicity nanostructure addresses backscattering with one resonator mode, and pumping that mode enables universal phase-matching for four-wave mixing with control by the bandgap. Yet, since nonlinear-resonator phenomena are intrinsically multimode and exhibit complex modelocking, here we demonstrate a new approach to controlling nonlinear interactions by creating bandgap modes completely separate from the pump laser. We explore this bandgap-detuned excitation regime through generation of benchmark optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and soliton microcombs. Indeed, we show that mode-locked states are phase matched more effectively in the bandgap-detuned regime in which we directly control the modal Kerr shift with the bandgaps without perturbing the pump field. In particular, bandgap-detuned excitation enables an arbitrary control of backscattering as a versatile tool for mode-locked state engineering. Our experiments leverage nanophotonic resonators for phase matching of OPOs and solitons, leading to control over threshold power, conversion efficiency, and emission direction that enable application advances in high-capacity signaling and computing, signal generation, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Measuring the refractive index and thickness of multilayer samples by Fourier domain optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-contact measurement of the refractive index and thickness of multilayer biological tissues is of great significance for biomedical applications and can greatly improve medical diagnosis and treatment. In this work, we introduce a theoretical method to simultaneously extract the above information using a Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) system, in which no additional arrangement and prior information about the object is required other than the OCT interference spectrum. The single reflection components can be extracted from the observed spectrum by isolating the primary spikes in the sample reflectance profile, and then the refractive index and thickness can be obtained by fitting the actual and modeled values of the single reflection spectrum. In a two-layer sample example, the simulation results show that our method can reconstruct the results with high accuracy. The relative error is within 0.01%. The complexity of our approach grows linearly with the number of sample layers, making it well-adapted to multilayer situations. Our method takes into account both single and multiple reflections in multilayer samples and is therefore equally applicable to samples with high refractive index contrast.</description>

      <title>Directional intense terahertz radiation driven by abruptly autofocusing lasers in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-color laser induced plasma filamentation in air could serve as tabletop sources of broadband terahertz (THz) pulses. Ubiquitous air in the earth facilitates its widespread utilities, particularly, in wireless communication and remote sensing, exploiting the unique advantage of the air-based scheme that the THz sources can be delivered over standoff distances via the pump laser propagation in air. However, the THz emission pattern inevitably has a conical angular profile with a dip in the propagation axis, therefore, THz energy concentration, propagation directionality, and accuracy of signal demodulation are significantly impaired, greatly limiting its direct applications. Here, we successfully eliminate the unfavorable conical profile by experiments and meanwhile enhance THz directionality and intensity by 17 folds by use of abruptly-autofocusing laser beams. Our theory and simulations show that these observations are attributed to efficient suppression of the dephasing effect appearing in previous investigations with ordinary Gaussian laser beams. This scheme is easily accessible since the abruptly-autofocusing beam can be achieved by imposing a spatial light modulator on the input Gaussian beam. This study solves a long-standing problem in the two-color laser scheme and clarifies the underlying physics of the conical angular profile formation.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton super-resolution imaging via virtual structured illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence imaging in thick biological tissues is challenging due to sample-induced aberration and scattering, which leads to severe degradation of image quality and resolution. Fluorescence imaging in reflection geometry further exacerbates this issue since the point spread function is distorted in both excitation and emission pathways. Here, we propose a novel approach termed adaptive optics virtual structured illumination microscopy (AO V-SIM) that enables super-resolution multiphoton imaging through a scattering medium in reflection geometry. Our approach exploits the incoherent reflection matrix obtained using a conventional point-scanning fluorescence microscope with an array detector. We introduce V-SIM super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on the incoherent reflection matrix. Furthermore, we introduce a software adaptive optics correction algorithm, AO V-SIM, which recovers unattenuated and phase-corrected optical transfer function for both excitation and emission pathways. The effectiveness of our proposed method is experimentally validated through sub-diffraction-limited two-photon fluorescence imaging of various samples in the presence of strong aberration.</description>

      <title>On-chip Kerr parametric oscillation with integrated heating for enhanced frequency tuning and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear microresonators can convert light from chip-integrated sources into new wavelengths within the visible and near-infrared spectrum. For most applications, such as the interrogation of quantum systems with specific transition wavelengths, tuning the frequency of converted light is critical. Nonetheless, demonstrations of wavelength conversion have mostly overlooked this metric. Here, we apply efficient integrated heaters to tune the idler frequency produced by Kerr optical parametric oscillation in a silicon-nitride microring across a continuous 1.5 terahertz range. Finally, we suppress idler frequency noise between DC and 5 kHz by several orders of magnitude using feedback to the heater drive.</description>

      <title>Deep and Dynamic Metabolic and Structural Imaging in Living Tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label-free imaging through two-photon autofluorescence (2PAF) of NAD(P)H allows for non-destructive and high-resolution visualization of cellular activities in living systems. However, its application to thick tissues and organoids has been restricted by its limited penetration depth within 300 $\mu$m, largely due to tissue scattering at the typical excitation wavelength (~750 nm) required for NAD(P)H. Here, we demonstrate that the imaging depth for NAD(P)H can be extended to over 700 $\mu$m in living engineered human multicellular microtissues by adopting multimode fiber (MMF)-based low-repetition-rate high-peak-power three-photon (3P) excitation of NAD(P)H at 1100 nm. This is achieved by having over 0.5 MW peak power at the band of 1100$\pm$25 nm through adaptively modulating multimodal nonlinear pulse propagation with a compact fiber shaper. Moreover, the 8-fold increase in pulse energy at 1100 nm enables faster imaging of monocyte behaviors in the living multicellular models. These results represent a significant advance for deep and dynamic metabolic and structural imaging of intact living biosystems. The modular design (MMF with a slip-on fiber shaper) is anticipated to allow wide adoption of this methodology for demanding in vivo and in vitro imaging applications, including cancer research, autoimmune diseases, and tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Generation of optical toroidal vortex with circular asymmetric gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal vortex, a topological structure commonly observed in nature, exist in various types such as bubbles produced by dolphins and the air flow surrounding a flying dandelion. A toroidal vortex corresponds to a spatiotemporal wave packet in the shape of a donut that propagates in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the ring. In this work, we propose a circular asymmetric grating to generate vortex rings. A cylindrical vector wave packet is transformed by the device into a transmitted toroidal vortex pulse. Such a compact toroidal vortex generator may find applications in optical topology research and high-dimensional optical communications.</description>

      <title>Solid and hollow plasmonic nanoresonators for carrier envelope phase read-out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of various plasmonic nanoantennae was numerically optimized to maximize their sensitivity to the carrier envelope phase (CEP) of the exciting ultra-short laser pulses. To verify the CEP sensitivity, the near-field response of the investigated nanoantennae was analyzed by combining frequency and time-domain numerical computations. The simulation methodology, capable of accurately calculating the time-dependent photocurrent stem from optical field emission, enabled the determination and optimization of all key parameters characterizing and governing the CEP dependence of the near-field responses. Three-types of structures were inspected, including individual triangular and teardrop-shaped nanoantennae and plasmonic lenses consisting of three hemispheres with gradually decreasing diameters. All structure types were optimized in solid and hollow compositions of gold nanoresonators as well. It was shown that hollow /solid singlets produce the largest /intermediate CEP dependent - to - CEP independent integrated current components' ratio, while their absolute CEP dependent integrated currents were the smallest /intermediate among the optimized structures. The highest /intermediate CEP sensitivity was achieved via solid plasmonic lenses due to their very large absolute CEP dependent integrated photocurrent originating from huge near-field enhancement in the nanogaps, while the integrated current components' ratio was smaller than for counterpart singlets.</description>

      <title>Practical GHz single-cavity all-fiber dual-comb laser for high-speed spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) with few-GHz tooth spacing that provides the optimal trade-off between spectral resolution and refresh rate is a powerful tool for measuring and analyzing rapidly evolving transient events. Despite such an exciting opportunity, existing technologies compromise either the spectral resolution or refresh rate, leaving few-GHz DCS with robust design largely unmet for frontier applications. In this work, we demonstrate a novel GHz DCS by exploring the multimode interference-mediated spectral filtering effect in an all-fiber ultrashort cavity configuration. The GHz single-cavity all-fiber dual-comb source is seeded by a dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser operating at fundamental repetition rates of about 1.0 GHz differing by 148 kHz, which has an excellent stability in the free-running state that the Allan deviation is only 101.7 mHz for an average time of 1 second. Thanks to the large repetition rate difference between the asynchronous dichromatic pulse trains, the GHz DCS enables a refresh time as short as 6.75 us, making it promising for studying nonrepeatable transient phenomena in real time. To this end, the practicality of the present GHz DCS is validated by successfully capturing the 'shock waves' of balloon and firecracker explosions outdoors. This GHz single-cavity all-fiber dual-comb system promises a noteworthy improvement in acquisition speed and reliability without sacrificing measurement accuracy, anticipated as a practical tool for high-speed applications.</description>

      <title>Metamaterial-induced-transparency engineering through quasi-bound states in the continuum by using dielectric cross-shaped trimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to activate a narrowband transparency line within a reflecting broadband window in all-dielectric metasurfaces, in analogy to the electromagnetically-induced transparency effect, by means of a quasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC). We demonstrate that the resonance overlapping of a bright mode and a qBIC-based nearly-dark mode with distinct Q-factor can be fully governed by a silicon trimer-based unit cell with broken-inversion-symmetry cross shape, thus providing the required response under normal incidence of a linearly-polarized light. Our analysis that is derived from the far-field multipolar decomposition and near-field electromagnetic distributions uncovers the main contributions of different multipoles on the qBIC resonance, with governing magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole terms supplied by distinct parts of the dielectric ``molecule.'' The findings extracted from this research open up new avenues for the development of polarization-dependent technologies, with particular interest in its capabilities for sensing and biosensing.</description>

      <title>Broadband microwave signal generation with programmable chirp shapes via low-speed electronics-controlled phase-modulated optical loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband microwave signals with customized chirp shapes are highly captivating in practical applications. Compared with electronic technology, photonic solutions are superior in bandwidth, but suffer from flexible and rapid manipulation of chirp shape. Here, we demonstrate a novel concept for generating broadband microwave signals with programmable chirp shapes. It is realized on a simple fiber-optic platform involving a continuous-wave laser, a phase-modulated optical loop, low-speed electronics at MHz, and an optical coherent receiver. Microwave signals with bandwidths beyond tens of GHz, even up to hundreds of GHz, can be generated, where the chirp shape is identical to the low-frequency driving waveform of the phase-modulated optical loop. Besides, signal parameters, such as bandwidth, center frequency, and temporal duration, can be reconfigured in real time. In the experiment, highly-coherent microwave signals with various customized chirp shapes are generated, where the time resolution for programming the chirp shape is 649 ps. The center frequency and bandwidth tuning ranges exceed 21 GHz, and the temporal duration is tuned in the range of 9 ns to 180 ns.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and conservation of spin angular momentum, helicity, and chirality in photonic time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-dependent dynamical properties of light as the spin angular momentum (SAM), helicity, and chirality are conserved quantities in free-space. Despite their similarities on account of their relationship with a circular state of polarization, SAM, helicity, and chirality emerge from distinct symmetries, which endows them with different physical meanings, properties, and practical applications. In this work, we investigate the behavior of such quantities in time-varying media (TVM), i.e., how a temporal modulation impacts their symmetries and conservation laws. Our results demonstrate that the SAM is conserved for any time modulation, helicity is only preserved in impedance-matched time modulations, while chirality is not conserved. In addition, the continuity equations highlight the dependence of the chirality with the energy content of the fields. These results provide additional insights into the similarities and differences between SAM, helicity, and chirality, as well as their physical meaning. Furthermore, our theoretical framework provides with a new perspective to analyze polarization-dependent light-matter interactions in TVM.</description>

      <title>Multichannel-GaAsP-photomultiplier-based fiber bundle ISM-STED microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usage of a GaAsP (gallium arsenide phosphide) photomultiplier for microscopical imaging allows the evaluation of low-light luminescent objects. We designed a setup for collecting a confocal microscopic image signal, which is divided into 14 equal-sized input channels. The division is achieved with a beamsplitter and two fiber bundles consisting of seven fibers each. Re-imaging the confocal pinhole by such a densely packed fiber bundle permits the utilization of a photon re-localization approach to overcome the optical resolution limit. The center fiber creates a real-time image, while the outer fibers enable a higher-resolution image via an image scanning microscope (ISM) signal calculation. The fiber bundles are enclosed in a fused silica capillary and are drawn out to create one solid fiber bundle. During the drawing process, the fiber bundles are tapered down to an outer diameter size of 400 {\mu}m, with each fiber having a less than 0.3 Airy unit diameter. For the photomultiplier interface, all fibers of both fiber bundles are integrated into a v-groove array, with each fiber representing a detection input, which is followed by projection optics for imaging onto the multichannel detector. The resulting confocal super-resolution microscope is suitable for the application of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) techniques such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), time-resolved anisotropy, or F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging</description>

      <title>Review of speckle-tracking algorithms for x-ray phase contrast imaging: low dose applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray speckles have been used for a wide variety of experiments, ranging from imaging (and tomography), wavefront sensing, spatial coherence measurements all the way to x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) and ptychography. In the near-field regime, x-ray speckle-grains preserve shape and size under free-space propagation for a static random modulation of the illumination, which permits using them as wavefront markers. The introduction of an object in the modulated field will lead to a displacement of the speckles due to refraction. Retrieving the local displacements enables access to the gradient of the phase-shift induced by the sample. The numerical process to retrieve the phase information is not trivial and numerous algorithms have been developed in the past decade with various advantages and limitations. This review focuses on near-field x-ray speckle phase imaging in the differential mode as described previously, introducing the existing algorithms with their specifications and comparing their performances under various experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust Quasi-Bound States in the continuum: Accidental and Symmetry-Protected Variants in Dielectric Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, man-made dielectric materials composed of finite-sized dielectric constituents have emerged as a promising platform for quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs). These states allow for an extraordinary confinement of light within regions smaller than the wavelength scale. Known for their exceptional quality factors, they have become crucial assets across a diverse array of applications. Given the circumstances, there is a compelling drive to find meta-designs that can possess multiple QBICs. Here, we demonstrate the existence of two different types of QBICs in silicon-based metasurfaces: accidental QBIC and symmetry-protected QBIC. The accidental QBIC evinces notable resilience to variations in geometrical parameters and symmetry, underscoring its capacity to adeptly navigate manufacturing tolerances while consistently upholding a distinguished quality factor of $10^5$. Conversely, the symmetry-protected QBIC inherently correlates with the disruption of unit cell symmetry. As a result, a phase delay yields an efficient channel for substantial energy transference to the continuum, endowing this variant with an exceedingly high quality factor, approaching $10^8$. Moreover, the manifestation of these QBICs stems from the intricate interplay among out-of-plane electric and magnetic dipoles, alongside in-plane quadrupoles exhibiting odd parities.</description>

      <title>Calibration of hydrogen atoms measurement by femtosecond two-photon laser induced fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new calibration method for H-fs-TALIF is proposed, and the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections $\sigma^{(2)}$ for atomic hydrogen (H) and krypton (Kr) is determined for the broadband emission of a femtosecond laser system. The obtained estimate of the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections $\sigma^{(2)}$ for H and Kr $\sigma^{(2)}$(Kr)/$\sigma^{(2)}$(H) = $0.034\pm 0.006$, which is almost twenty times lower than the values previously obtained using narrowband nanosecond lasers. This difference is explained by the significantly different spectral width of the excitation line, and demonstrates the need for independent calibration of the TALIF measurements in the femtosecond range.</description>

      <title>Subtraction and Addition of Propagating Photons by Two-Level Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent manipulation of quantum states of light is key to photonic quantum information processing. In this Letter, we show that a passive two-level nonlinearity suffices to implement non-Gaussian quantum operations on propagating field modes. In particular, the collective light-matter interaction can efficiently extract a single photon from a multi-photon input wave packet to an orthogonal temporal mode. We accurately describe the single-photon subtraction process by elements of an intuitive quantum-trajectory model. By employing this process, quantum information protocols gain orders of magnitude improved efficiency over heralded schemes with linear optics. The reverse process can be used to add photons one-by-one to a single wave-packet mode and compose arbitrarily large Fock states with a finite total success probability $&gt;96.7\%$.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-accurate and wafer-scale process for nonlinear frequency mixers in thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonics have led to a new generation of high-performance electro-optic devices, including modulators, frequency combs, and microwave-to-optical transducers. However, the broader adoption of TFLN-based devices that rely on all-optical nonlinearities have been limited by the sensitivity of quasi-phase matching (QPM), realized via ferroelectric poling, to fabrication tolerances. Here, we propose a scalable fabrication process aimed at improving the wavelength-accuracy of optical frequency mixers in TFLN. In contrast to the conventional pole-before-etch approach, we first define the waveguide in TFLN and then perform ferroelectric poling. This sequence allows for precise metrology before and after waveguide definition to fully capture the geometry imperfections. Systematic errors can also be calibrated by measuring a subset of devices to fine-tune the QPM design for remaining devices on the wafer. Using this method, we fabricated a large number of second harmonic generation devices aimed at generating 737 nm light, with 73% operating within 5 nm of the target wavelength. Furthermore, we also demonstrate thermo-optic tuning and trimming of the devices via cladding deposition, with the former bringing ~96% of tested devices to the target wavelength. Our technique enables the rapid growth of integrated quantum frequency converters, photon pair sources, and optical parametric amplifiers, thus facilitating the integration of TFLN-based nonlinear frequency mixers into more complex and functional photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of an optical tweezer phonon laser</title>

Abstract: The creation and manipulation of coherence continues to capture the attention of scientists and engineers. The optical laser is a canonical example of a system that, in principle, exhibits complete coherence. Recent research has focused on the creation of coherent, laser-like states in other physical systems. The phonon laser is one example where it is possible to amplify self-sustained mechanical oscillations. A single mode phonon laser in a levitated optical tweezer has been demonstrated through appropriate balance of active feedback gain and damping. In this work, coherent control of the dynamics of an optical tweezer phonon laser is used to share coherence between its different modes of oscillation, creating a multimode phonon laser. The coupling of the modes is achieved by periodically rotating the asymmetric optical potential in the transverse focal plane of the trapping beam via trap laser polarization rotation. The presented theory and experiment demonstrate that coherence can be transferred across different modes of an optical tweezer phonon laser, and are a step toward using these systems for precision measurement and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb from a silicon nitride microring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated microresonator facilitates the realization of quantum frequency comb (QFC), which provides a large number of discrete frequency modes with broadband spectral range and narrow linewidth. However, all previous demonstrations have focused on the generation of energy-time or time-bin entangled photons from QFC. Realizing polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb, which is the important resource for fundamental study of quantum mechanics and quantum information applications, remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, a broadband polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb by combining an integrated silicon nitride micro-resonator with a Sagnac interferometer. With a free spectral range of about 99 GHz and a narrow linewidth of about 190 MHz, our source provides 22 polarization entangled photons pairs with frequency covering the whole telecom C-band. The entanglement fidelities for all 22 pairs are above 81%, including 17 pairs with fidelities higher than 90%. Our demonstration paves the way for employing the polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb in quantum network using CMOS technology as well as standard dense wavelength division multiplexing technology.</description>
