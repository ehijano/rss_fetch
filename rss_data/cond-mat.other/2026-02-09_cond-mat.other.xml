      <title>A Unified Wake Topology Map for He II Counterflow Past a Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal counterflow of superfluid $^4$He past a cylinder produces quasi-steady eddies not only downstream but also anomalously upstream. However, the mechanism and organizing principles behind the observed multistable wake topologies (0-, 2-, 4-, and 6-vortex states) have remained unclear. We show that the full spectrum of reported normal-fluid wake states is captured numerically with a two-fluid model coupled to Vinen's vortex-line-density equation. Our simulations further reveal that the superfluid component can also develop anomalous upstream eddies, a feature not previously reported. We trace these behaviors to a self-organized zone of enhanced mutual-friction dissipation near the cylinder shoulders that reshapes the effective obstacle, drives upstream eddies in both components, and suppresses intrinsic wake oscillations in the normal fluid. Guided by this mechanism, we perform systematic parameter scans and construct a unified phase diagram in terms of the normal-fluid Reynolds number $Re_n$ and a dimensionless interaction number $N$, separating inertia- and mutual-friction-controlled transitions and delineating the parameter windows for the discrete wake topologies. These results turn a striking phenomenology into a predictive map and establish mutual-friction feedback as a robust route to unusual wake structures in quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and localisation in causally constrained quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the connection between causality and many-body dynamics by studying the algebraic structure of tri-partite unitaries ('walls') which permanently arrest local operator spreading in their time-periodic evolution. We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to the splitting of operator space into commuting sub-algebras. The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos. We prove an entanglement area-law due to local constraints and we study its stability against projective measurements. In a random ensemble exhibiting causal independence, we compare spectral correlations with the universal (chaotic) ensemble using the spectral form factor. Our results offer a rigorous understanding of locally constrained quantum dynamics from a quantum information perspective.</description>

      <title>HSG-12M: A Large-Scale Benchmark of Spatial Multigraphs from the Energy Spectra of Non-Hermitian Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI is transforming scientific research by revealing new ways to understand complex physical systems, but its impact remains constrained by the lack of large, high-quality domain-specific datasets. A rich, largely untapped resource lies in non-Hermitian quantum physics, where the energy spectra of crystals form intricate geometries on the complex plane -- termed as Hamiltonian spectral graphs. Despite their significance as fingerprints for electronic behavior, their systematic study has been intractable due to the reliance on manual extraction. To unlock this potential, we introduce Poly2Graph: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that automates the mapping of 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Using this tool, we present HSG-12M: a dataset containing 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic Hamiltonian spectral graphs across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, distilled from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Crucially, HSG-12M is the first large-scale dataset of spatial multigraphs -- graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. This simultaneously addresses a critical gap, as existing graph benchmarks overwhelmingly assume simple, non-spatial edges, discarding vital geometric information. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning spatial multi-edges at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics, new opportunities in geometry-aware graph learning and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Room-Temperature Ferrotoroidic Material Exhibiting Magnetic Semiconductor Properties with Superhigh Hole Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design and fabrication of room-temperature ferrotoroidic materials and magnetic semiconductors are recognized worldwide as a great challenge, and of both theoretical and practical importance in the field of condensed matter physics and information storage. Reported herein are ferrotoroidic crystal powder and film formed by supramolecular self-assembly based on uranyl and cyclodextrin, with the Curie temperature above room temperature. Experimental measurements and calculations demonstrate spontaneous vortex-like alignment of magnetic moments and furthermore a macroscopic long-range arrangement in the crystal, which breaks simultaneously space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries, exhibiting strong superexchange, spin-orbit coupling as well as anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The electrical measurements show the film with a superhigh carrier mobility of 3200 cm2*V-1*s-1 and a Hall resistivity as high as 0.32 mV*A-1*cm at room temperature. This work is expected to pave greatly the applied research on new-generation magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), especially as flexible material.</description>
