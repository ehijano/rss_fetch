      <title>Systematic Uncertainties in the Measurement of Neutron lifetime Using Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifetime of free neutrons measured in the lab has a long standing disparity of $\sim$9~s. A space-based technique has recently been proposed to independently measure the neutron lifetime using interactions between the galactic cosmic rays and a low atmosphere planetary body. This technique has not produced competitive results yet due to constraints of non-optimized data that contain large systematic errors. We use data from the neutron spectrometer on-board NASA's Lunar Prospector, and quantify the effects of lunar sub-surface temperature and the composition on the measurement of neutron lifetime. We use the HeCd and HeSn neutron spectrometer data when the spacecraft was in a highly elliptical orbit during the orbit insertion period. We report the neutron lifetime using lunar composition maps at different resolutions: 5$^{\circ}$ Prettyman+2006 and 2$^{\circ}$ re-binned Wilson+2021 maps to be 777.59$\pm$11.71~s and 739.64$\pm$10.83~s respectively. Further, for the 20$^{\circ}$ map, we apply both a constant equatorial and a latitude-dependent temperature model and report 738.63$\pm$10.75~s and 767.33$\pm$11.17~s respectively. We report the weighted average of the four measurements to be $\tau_n = 754.72 ^{+34.58}_{-25.91}$~s.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the Porter-Thomas distribution due to non-statistical $\gamma$ decay below the $^{150}$Nd neutron separation threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for the study of fluctuations of partial transition widths based on nuclear resonance fluorescence experiments with quasimonochromatic linearly-polarized photon beams below particle separation thresholds. It is based on the average branching of decays of $J=1$ states of an even-even nucleus to the $2^+_1$ state in comparison to the ground state. Between 5 and 7 MeV, an almost constant average branching ratio of 0.490(16) is observed for the nuclide $^{150}$Nd. Assuming $\chi^2$-distributed partial transition widths, this average branching ratio is related to a degree of freedom of $\nu = 1.93(12)$, rejecting the validity of the Porter-Thomas distribution, requiring $\nu=1$. The observed deviation can be explained by non-statistical effects in the $\gamma$-decay behavior with contributions in the range of 9.4(10)% up to 94(10)%.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Translation of Point Clouds for Modeling Detector Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling detector response is a key challenge in time projection chambers. We cast this problem as an unpaired point cloud translation task, between data collected from simulations and from experimental runs. Effective translation can assist with both noise rejection and the construction of high-fidelity simulators. Building on recent work in diffusion probabilistic models, we present a novel framework for performing this mapping. We demonstrate the success of our approach in both synthetic domains and in data sourced from the Active-Target Time Projection Chamber.</description>

      <title>Novel Scalings of Neutron Star Properties from Analyzing Dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TOV equations govern the radial evolution of pressure and energy density in static neutron stars (NSs) in hydrodynamical equilibrium. Using the reduced pressure and energy density with respect to the NS central energy density, the original TOV equations can be recast into dimensionless forms. While the traditionally used integral approach for solving the original TOV equations require an input nuclear Equation of State (EOS), the dimensionless TOV equations can be anatomized by using the reduced pressure and energy density as polynomials of the reduced radial coordinate without using any input nuclear EOS. Interesting and novel perspectives about NS core EOS can be extracted directly from NS observables using this new approach based on Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless (IPAD) TOV equations (IPAD-TOV). In this review, we first discuss the length and energy density scales of NSs as well as the dimensionless TOV equations for scaled variables and their perturbative solutions near NS cores. We then review several new insights into NS physics gained from using the IPAD-TOV. We also demonstrate that the strong-field gravity plays a fundamental role in extruding a peak in the density/radius profile of the speed of sound squared (SSS) in massive NS cores independent of the nuclear EOS. Finally, some future perspectives of NS research using the IPAD-TOV are outlined.</description>

      <title>Maintaining a Resonance Condition of an RF Spin Rotator Through a Feedback Loop in a Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the successful application of a phase-lock feedback system to maintain the resonance condition of a radio frequency (rf) spin rotator (specifically, an rf Wien filter) with respect to a 120 kHz spin precession in the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) storage ring. Real-time monitoring of the spin precession and the rf Wien filter signal allows the relative phase between the two to be stabilized at an arbitrary setpoint. The feedback system compensates for deviations in the relative phase by adjusting the frequency and/or phase as needed. With this method, a variation in phase relative to the demand phase with a standard deviation of $\sigma_{\Delta\varphi}\approx 0.2\mathrm{rad}$ could be achieved. The system was implemented in two runs aiming at a first direct measurement of the deuteron electric dipole moment in 2018 and 2021. In addition, the difference between a single-bunch beam affected by the spin rotator and a two-bunch system in which only one bunch is exposed to the spin rotator fields is discussed. Both methods have been used during these beam times. The ability to keep the spin precession and the rf fields synchronized is also crucial for future investigations of electric dipole moments of charged particles using storage rings.</description>

      <title>New direct limit on neutrinoless double beta decay half-life of $^{128}$Te with CUORE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso of INFN in Italy is an experiment searching for neutrinoless double beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Its main goal is to investigate this decay in $^{130}$Te, but its ton-scale mass and low background make CUORE sensitive to other rare processes as well. In this work, we present our first results on the search for \nbb decay of $^{128}$Te, the Te isotope with the second highest natural isotopic abundance. We find no evidence for this decay, and using a Bayesian analysis we set a lower limit on the $^{128}$Te \nbb decay half-life of T$_{1/2} &gt; 3.6 \times 10^{24}$ yr (90\% CI). This represents the most stringent limit on the half-life of this isotope, improving by over a factor 30 the previous direct search results, and exceeding those from geochemical experiments for the first time.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the production cross section of prompt $\Xi^0_{\rm c}$ baryons in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) differential production cross section of the promptly produced charm-strange baryon $\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}$ (and its charge conjugate $\overline{\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}}$) is measured at midrapidity via its hadronic decay into ${\rm \pi^{+}}\Xi^{-}$ in p$-$Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon$-$nucleon collision $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The $\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}$ nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm pPb}$), calculated from the cross sections in pp and p$-$Pb collisions, is presented and compared with the $R_{\rm pPb}$ of $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons. The ratios between the $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross section of $\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}$ baryons and those of $\mathrm {D^0}$ mesons and $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons are also reported and compared with results at forward and backward rapidity from the LHCb Collaboration. The measurements of the production cross section of prompt $\Xi^0_{\rm c}$ baryons are compared with a model based on perturbative QCD calculations of charm-quark production cross sections, which includes only cold nuclear matter effects in p$-$Pb collisions, and underestimates the measurement by a factor of about 50. This discrepancy is reduced when the data is compared with a model that includes string formation beyond leading-colour approximation or in which hadronisation is implemented via quark coalescence. The $p_{\rm T}$-integrated cross section of prompt $\Xi^0_{\rm c}$-baryon production at midrapidity extrapolated down to $p_{\rm T}$ = 0 is also reported. These measurements offer insights and constraints for theoretical calculations of the hadronisation process. Additionally, they provide inputs for the calculation of the charm production cross section in p$-$Pb collisions at midrapidity.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness hadronization with event-by-event production of multistrange hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents the first measurement of event-by-event fluctuations of the net number (difference between the particle and antiparticle multiplicities) of multistrange hadrons $\Xi^-$ and $\overline{\Xi}^+$ and its correlation with the net-kaon number using the data collected by the ALICE Collaboration in pp, p$-$Pb, and Pb$-$Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02\ \mathrm{TeV}$. The statistical hadronization model with a correlation over three units of rapidity between hadrons having the same and opposite strangeness content successfully describes the results. On the other hand, string-fragmentation models that mainly correlate strange hadrons with opposite strange quark content over a small rapidity range fail to describe the data.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the inclusive isolated-photon production cross section in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production cross section of inclusive isolated photons has been measured by the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC in pp collisions at centre-of-momentum energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected during the LHC Run 2 data-taking period. The measurement is performed by combining the measurements of the electromagnetic calorimeter EMCal and the central tracking detectors ITS and TPC, covering a pseudorapidity range of $|\eta^{\gamma}|&lt;0.67$ and a transverse momentum range of $7&lt;p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}&lt;200$ GeV/$c$. The result extends to lower $p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ and $x_{\rm T}^{\gamma} = 2p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}/\sqrt{s}$ ranges, the lowest $x_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ of any isolated photon measurements to date, extending significantly those measured by the ATLAS and CMS experiments towards lower $p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ at the same collision energy with a small overlap between the measurements. The measurement is compared with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and the results from the ATLAS and CMS experiments as well as with measurements at other collision energies. The measurement and theory prediction are in agreement with each other within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Particle production as a function of charged-particle flattenicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the first measurement of the transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra of primary charged pions, kaons, (anti)protons, and unidentified particles as a function of the charged-particle flattenicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Flattenicity is a novel event shape observable that is measured in the pseudorapidity intervals covered by the V0 detector, $2.8&lt;\eta&lt;5.1$ and $-3.7&lt;\eta&lt;-1.7$. According to QCD-inspired phenomenological models, it shows sensitivity to multiparton interactions and is less affected by biases toward larger $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ due to local multiplicity fluctuations in the V0 acceptance than multiplicity. The analysis is performed in minimum-bias (MB) as well as in high-multiplicity events up to $p_{\mathrm{T}}=20$ GeV/$c$. The event selection requires at least one charged particle produced in the pseudorapidity interval $|\eta|&lt;1$. The measured $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ distributions, average $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, kaon-to-pion and proton-to-pion particle ratios, presented in this paper, are compared to model calculations using PYTHIA 8 based on color strings and EPOS LHC. The modification of the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-spectral shapes in low-flattenicity events that have large event activity with respect to those measured in MB events develops a pronounced peak at intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ ($2&lt;p_{\mathrm{T}}&lt;8$ GeV/$c$), and approaches the vicinity of unity at higher $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The results are qualitatively described by PYTHIA, and they show different behavior than those measured as a function of charged-particle multiplicity based on the V0M estimator.</description>

      <title>Constraint on initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding fluids from nonlinear causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are scrutinized in terms of nonlinear causality of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Conventionally, it is believed that the matter generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions starts to behave as a fluid all at once at some initial time. However, it is by no means trivial how soon after the first contact of two high-energy nuclei the fluid picture can be applied. It is demonstrated that one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids violate the necessary and the sufficient conditions of nonlinear causality at large departures from local equilibrium. We therefore quantify the inverse Reynolds number to justify the hydrodynamic description to be valid. The initial conditions are strictly constrained not to violate the causality conditions during the time evolution. With the help of the transverse energies per rapidity measured at RHIC and LHC, we obtain the minimum initial proper time and the maximum energy density allowed by nonlinear causality. This analysis strongly suggests that the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions needs to be described by a non-equilibrium description other than the framework of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics.</description>
