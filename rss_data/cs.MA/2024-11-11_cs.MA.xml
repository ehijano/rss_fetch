      <title>Data-Driven Distributed Common Operational Picture from Heterogeneous Platforms using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned platforms equipped with advanced sensors promises to enhance situational awareness and mitigate the "fog of war" in military operations. However, managing the vast influx of data from these platforms poses a significant challenge for Command and Control (C2) systems. This study presents a novel multi-agent learning framework to address this challenge. Our method enables autonomous and secure communication between agents and humans, which in turn enables real-time formation of an interpretable Common Operational Picture (COP). Each agent encodes its perceptions and actions into compact vectors, which are then transmitted, received and decoded to form a COP encompassing the current state of all agents (friendly and enemy) on the battlefield. Using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), we jointly train COP models and agent's action selection policies. We demonstrate resilience to degraded conditions such as denied GPS and disrupted communications. Experimental validation is performed in the Starcraft-2 simulation environment to evaluate the precision of the COPs and robustness of policies. We report less than 5% error in COPs and policies resilient to various adversarial conditions. In summary, our contributions include a method for autonomous COP formation, increased resilience through distributed prediction, and joint training of COP models and multi-agent RL policies. This research advances adaptive and resilient C2, facilitating effective control of heterogeneous unmanned platforms.</description>

      <title>Expectation vs. Reality: Towards Verification of Psychological Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game theory provides an effective way to model strategic interactions among rational agents. In the context of formal verification, these ideas can be used to produce guarantees on the correctness of multi-agent systems, with a diverse range of applications from computer security to autonomous driving. Psychological games (PGs) were developed as a way to model and analyse agents with belief-dependent motivations, opening up the possibility to model how human emotions can influence behaviour. In PGs, players' utilities depend not only on what actually happens (which strategies players choose to adopt), but also on what the players had expected to happen (their belief as to the strategies that would be played). Despite receiving much attention in fields such as economics and psychology, very little consideration has been given to their applicability to problems in computer science, nor to practical algorithms and tool support. In this paper, we start to bridge that gap, proposing methods to solve PGs and implementing them within PRISM-games, a formal verification tool for stochastic games. We discuss how to model these games, highlight specific challenges for their analysis and illustrate the usefulness of our approach on several case studies, including human behaviour in traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of Campus Population Behaviors for Pandemic Response Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a case study of an application of high-resolution agent-based modeling and simulation to pandemic response planning on a university campus. In the summer of 2020, we were tasked with a COVID-19 pandemic response project to create a detailed behavioral simulation model of the entire campus population at Binghamton University. We conceptualized this problem as an agent migration process on a multilayer transportation network, in which each layer represented a different transportation mode. As no direct data were available about people's behaviors on campus, we collected as much indirect information as possible to inform the agents' behavioral rules. Each agent was assumed to move along the shortest path between two locations within each transportation layer and switch layers at a parking lot or a bus stop, along with several other behavioral assumptions. Using this model, we conducted simulations of the whole campus population behaviors on a typical weekday, involving more than 25,000 agents. We measured the frequency of close social contacts at each spatial location and identified several busy locations and corridors on campus that needed substantial behavioral intervention. Moreover, systematic simulations with varying population density revealed that the effect of population density reduction was nonlinear, and that reducing the population density to 40-45% would be optimal and sufficient to suppress disease spreading on campus. These results were reported to the university administration and utilized in the pandemic response planning, which led to successful outcomes.</description>
