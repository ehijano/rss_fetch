      <title>A Representability Theorem for Stacks in Derived Geometry Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representability theorem for stacks, due to Artin in the underived setting and Lurie in the derived setting, gives conditions under which a stack is representable by an $n$-geometric stack. In recent work of Ben-Bassat, Kelly, and Kremnizer, a new theory of derived analytic geometry has been proposed as geometry relative to the $(\infty,1)$-category of simplicial commutative Ind-Banach $R$-modules, for $R$ a Banach ring. In this paper, we prove a representability theorem which holds in a very general context, which we call a representability context, encompassing both the derived algebraic geometry context of To\"en and Vezzosi and these new derived analytic geometry contexts. The representability theorem gives natural and easily verifiable conditions for checking that derived stacks in these contexts are $n$-geometric, such as having an $n$-geometric truncation, being nilcomplete, and having an obstruction theory. Future work will explore representability of certain moduli stacks arising in derived analytic geometry, for example moduli stacks of Galois representations.</description>

      <title>On the universal and generalized orbifold Euler characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the universal orbifold Euler characteristic and generalized orbifold Euler characteristics corresponding to finitely generated groups $A$ (the $A$-Euler characteristics). We show that the collection of all $A$-Euler characteristics for $A$ of the form $A'\times Z$ ($Z$ is the group of integers) with finite $A'$ determine the universal orbifold Euler characteristic.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic directions in the moduli space of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study asymptotic directions in the tangent bundle of the moduli space ${\mathcal M}_g$ of curves of genus $g$, namely those tangent directions that are annihilated by the second fundamental form of the Torelli map. We give examples of asymptotic directions for any $g \geq 4$. We prove that if the rank $d$ of a tangent direction $\zeta \in H^1(T_C)$ (with respect to the infinitesimal deformation map) is less than the Clifford index of the curve $C$, then $\zeta$ is not asymptotic. If the rank of $\zeta$ is equal to the Clifford index of the curve, we give sufficient conditions ensuring that the infinitesimal deformation $\zeta$ is not asymptotic. Then we determine all asymptotic directions of rank 1 and we give an almost complete description of asymptotic directions of rank 2.</description>

      <title>Nakajima's quiver varieties and triangular bases of bipartite cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berenstein and Zelevinsky introduced quantum cluster algebras \cite{BZ1} and the triangular bases \cite{BZ2}. The support conjecture proposed in \cite{LLRZ}, which asserts that the support of each triangular basis element for a rank-2 cluster algebra is bounded by an explicitly described region, was established in \cite{L} for skew-symmetric rank-2 cluster algebras. In this paper we extend this result by proving a bound on the support of each triangular basis element for bipartite cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>On the subadditivity of generalized Kodaira dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goals of this paper are of two aspects. Firstly, we introduce the notion of generalized numerical Kodaira dimension with multiplier ideal sheaf and establish the subadditivity inequalities in terms of this notion, which can be used to give an analytic proof of O. Fujino's result on the subadditivity of the log Kodaira dimensions. Secondly, motivated by Zhou-Zhu's subadditivity of generalized Kodaira dimensions, we adopt another definition of generalized Kodaira dimension with multiplier ideal sheaf and show they are equal by using Okounkov bodies. As one application, we show that the superadditivity part in Zhou-Zhu's setting also holds true. As another application, we give an alternative proof of Zhou-Zhu's subadditivity formula, in the case when the singular metric $h_L$ has analytic singularities, by using generalized Iitaka fibrations.</description>

      <title>Building Data for Stacky Covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.10290v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define stacky building data for stacky covers in the spirit of Pardini and give an equivalence of (2,1)-categories between the category of stacky covers and the category of stacky building data. We show that every stacky cover is a flat root stack in the sense of Olsson and Borne--Vistoli and give an intrinsic description of it as a root stack using stacky building data. When the base scheme S is defined over a field, we give a criterion for when a birational building datum comes from a tamely ramified cover for a finite abelian group scheme, generalizing a result of Biswas--Borne.</description>

      <title>On products of K-moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the K-moduli space of products of Fano varieties in relation to the product of K-moduli spaces of the product components. We show that there exists a well-defined morphism from the product of K-moduli stacks of Fano varieties to the K-moduli stack of their product. Furthermore, we show that this morphism is an isomorphism if any two varieties with different irreducible components are non-isomorphic, and a torsor if they are. Our results rely on the theory of stacks and previous work by Zhuang.
  We use our main result to obtain an explicit description of the K-moduli stack/ space of Fano threefolds with Picard rank greater than 6, along with a wall-crossing description, and a detailed polyhedral wall-crossing description for K-moduli of log Fano pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the better-behaved GKZ hypergeometric systems to study toric Calabi-Yau Deligne-Mumford stacks and their Hori-Vafa mirrors given by affine hypersurfaces in algebraic tori. We show the equality between A-brane and B-brane central charges, in terms of period integrals and hypergeometric series respectively. This settles a conjecture of Hosono, which could also be considered as a generalization of the Gamma conjecture for local mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>On Hodge structures of compact complex manifolds with semistable degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact K\"{a}hler manifolds satisfy several nice Hodge-theoretic properties such as the Hodge symmetry, the Hard Lefschetz property and the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations, etc. In this note, we investigate when such nice properties hold on compact complex manifolds with semistable degenerations. For compact complex manifolds which can be obtained as smoothings of SNC varieties without triple intersection locus, we show the Hodge symmetry when the monodromy logarithm induces isomorphisms on the associated graded. We also show the Hodge-Riemann relations on H^3 of compact complex 3-folds with such semistable degenerations under some conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a lattice-theoretic classification of non-symplectic automorphisms of prime order of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds of OG10 type. We determine which automorphisms are induced by a non-symplectic automorphism of prime order of a cubic fourfold on the associated LSV manifolds, giving a geometric and lattice-theoretic description of the algebraic and transcendental lattices of the cubic fourfold. As an application we discuss the rationality conjecture for a general cubic fourfold with a non-symplectic automorphism of prime order.</description>

      <title>A Specialisation Theorem for Lang-N\'eron Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, for a polarised smooth projective variety $B \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_k$ of dimension $\geq 2$ over an infinite field $k$ and an abelian variety $A$ over the function field of $B$, there exists a dense Zariski open set of smooth geometrically connected hyperplane sections $h$ of $B$ such that $A$ has good reduction at $h$ and the specialisation homomorphism of Lang-N\'eron groups at $h$ is injective (up to a finite $p$-group in positive characteristic $p$). This gives a positive answer to a conjecture of the first author, which is used to deduce a negative definiteness result on his refined height pairing. This also sheds a new light on N\'eron's specialisation theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we establish an $L^2$ extension theorem for Nakano semi-positive singular Hermitian metrics on holomorphic vector bundles, and the strong openness and stability properties of the multiplier submodule sheaves associated to Nakano semi-positive singular Hermitian metrics on holomorphic vector bundles.
  We solve affirmatively a question of Lempert on the preservation of Nakano semi-positivity under limit of an increasing metrics based on Deng-Ning-Wang-Zhou's characterization of Nakano positivity.</description>
