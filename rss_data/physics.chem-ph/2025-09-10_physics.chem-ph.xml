      <title>Tracking photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with simulated time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiropyran is a prototype photoswitch that undergoes photoinduced ring-opening via C-O bond fission. The quantum yield for this photochemical reaction is low, with photophysical relaxation being the dominant process. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that photophysical relaxation proceeds via cleavage and subsequent reformation of a C-N bond. However, experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking; most time-resolved studies have probed in the ultraviolet-visible domain, where C-N bond fission is unlikely to leave clear signatures. Here, we use non-adiabatic dynamics simulations in conjunction with X-ray absorption spectroscopic calculations to investigate the possibility of tracking the photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the nitrogen K-edge. The simulations predict that cleavage of the C-N bond results in a transient red-shift of the X-ray absorption. These results indicate a potential experimental route to gain a mechanistic understanding of the efficient photophysical relaxation that limits the efficiency of spiropyran-based photochromic systems.</description>

      <title>Model Order Reduction for Quantum Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are indispensable for exploring the behavior of atoms and molecules. Grounded in quantum mechanical principles, quantum molecular dynamics provides high predictive power but its computational cost is dominated by iterative high-fidelity electronic structure calculations. We propose a novel model order reduction approach as an alternative to high-fidelity electronic structure calculation. By learning a low-dimensional representation of the electronic solution manifold within the Kohn-Sham density functional theory framework, our model order reduction approach determines the ground state electronic density by projecting the problem onto a low-dimensional subspace, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive iterative optimization of electronic wavefunctions in the full space. We demonstrate the capability of our method on a water molecule, showing excellent agreement with high-fidelity simulations for both molecular geometry and dynamic properties, highlighting the generalizability through carefully designed parametrization and systematic sampling.</description>

      <title>Selective excitation of molecular vibrations via a two-mode cavity Raman scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental realization of strong light-matter coupling with molecules initiated the rapidly evolving field of molecular polaritonics. Most studies focus on how exciton polaritons, which combine electronic excitations with confined light modes, alter photochemistry. In this paper, we investigate their use in selectively exciting molecular vibrational states in the ground state. Selectively exciting molecules to high vibrational states with infrared lasers to catalyze ground-state chemical reactions is a challenging task. Here, we propose a two-cavity mode setup in the electronic strong coupling regime inspired by the process of Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) to selectively populate excited vibrational states. One cavity mode actively pumps the molecular system, while the other provides a highly effective and tunable decay channel via photon leakage. We demonstrate the ability to selectively populate vibrational states for coherent and incoherent light sources using a molecular model system. Our initial findings show high efficiency and suggest a possible route to steering and controlling chemical reactions in the electronic ground state based on electronic strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Recursive algorithm for constructing antisymmetric fermionic states in first quantization mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise a deterministic quantum algorithm to produce antisymmetric states of single-particle orbitals in the first quantization mapping. Unlike sorting-based antisymmetrization algorithms, which require ordered input states and high Clifford-gate overhead, our approach initializes the state of each particle independently. For a system of $N$ particles and $N_s$ single-particle states, our algorithm prepares antisymmetrized states of non-trivial localized (e.g., Hartree-Fock) orbitals using $O(N^2\sqrt{N_s})$ $T$-gates, outperforming alternative algorithms when $N\lesssim \sqrt{N_s}$. To achieve such scaling, we require $O(\sqrt{N_s})$ dirty ancilla qubits for intermediate calculations. Knowledge of the single-particle states to be antisymmetrized can be leveraged to further improve the efficiency of the circuit, and a measurement-based variant reduces gate cost by roughly a factor of two. We show example circuits for two- and three-particle systems and discuss the generalization to an arbitrary number of particles. For a specific three-particle example, we decompose the circuit into Clifford$+T$ gates and study the impact of noise on the prepared state.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Zeolite Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials (IPs) with wide elemental coverage and high accuracy are powerful tools for high-throughput materials discovery. While the past few years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs, including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite screening workflows involving various compositions.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Efficient Molecule Geometry Optimization with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately and efficiently predicting the equilibrium geometries of large molecules remains a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, even with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Two major obstacles hinder progress: the large number of qubits required and the prohibitive cost of conventional nested optimization. In this work, we introduce a co-optimization framework that combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to address these limitations. This approach substantially reduces the required quantum resources, enabling the treatment of molecular systems significantly larger than previously feasible. We first validate our framework on benchmark systems, such as H4 and H2O2, before demonstrating its efficacy in determining the equilibrium geometry of glycolic acid C2H4O3, a molecule of a size previously considered intractable for quantum geometry optimization. Our results show the method achieves high accuracy while drastically lowering computational cost. This work thus represents a significant step toward practical, scalable quantum simulations, moving beyond the small, proof-of-concept molecules that have historically dominated the field. More broadly, our framework establishes a tangible path toward leveraging quantum advantage for the in silico design of complex catalysts and pharmaceuticals.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Orbital Selectivity through Linear-Orbital Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates electron transport through chiral electrostatic potentials by modeling the system in three spatial dimensions and demonstrates that chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS) produces pronounced enantiospecific transmission, dependent on the electron's initial orbital angular momentum (OAM) state. The results show that transverse electron motion in a chiral environment, captured by OAM dynamics, gives rise to strong orbital selectivity that reverses upon inversion of the handedness of the chiral potential. This behavior originates from a coupling between the electron's linear and orbital angular momenta, leading to effects that are significantly stronger than those arising from spin-phonon and bare spin-orbit interactions under realistic physical conditions. Moreover, the CIOS effect is shown to increase with the length of the chiral region and remains robust against static disorder. The orbital selectivity can give rise to spin selectivity when initial correlations exist between spin and OAM states. These findings underscore the importance of orbital contributions to enantiospecific electron transport in chiral systems and suggest that CIOS plays a critical role alongside existing spin-based mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks for Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay the foundation for a quantum algorithmic framework to analyse fixed-structure chemical reaction networks (CRNs) using quantum random walks (QRWs) via electrical circuit theory. We model perturbations to CRNs, such as, species injections that shift steady-state concentrations, while keeping the underlying species-reaction graph fixed. Under physically meaningful mass-action constraints, we develop quantum algorithms that (i) decide reachability of target species after perturbation, (ii) sample representative reachable species, (iii) approximate steady-state fluxes through reactions, and (iv) estimate total Gibbs free-energy consumption. Our approach offers new tools for analysing the structure and energetics of complex CRNs, and opens up the prospect of scalable quantum algorithms for chemical and biochemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Two-legged approximation for building non-empirical hybrids and analyzing correlation at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm dense matter is a highly energetic phase characterized by strong correlations, thermal effects, and quantum effects of electrons. Thermal density functional theory is commonly used in simulations of this challenging phase, driving the development of temperature-dependent approximations to the exchange-correlation free energy. In this work, a finite-temperature extension of the two-legged adiabatic connection construction is demonstrated for the uniform electron gas and asymmetric Hubbard dimer at warm dense matter conditions. This provides the structure of a temperature- and density-dependent weighting scheme for a hybrid exchange-correlation approximation. The construction also provides evidence that nonlinear thermal effects on the balance between exchange and correlation, as well as that between kinetic, entropic, and potential components of the correlation, persist and can even be emphasized by strong electron-electron interaction. These findings point additionally to a complicated interplay between temperature, density, and interaction strength in the strong correlation character of these model systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is arguably the most popular noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era approach to quantum chemistry. We consider the underexplored quantum annealing eigensolver (QAE) algorithm as a worthy alternative. We use a combination of numerical calculations for a system where strong correlation effects dominate, and conclusions drawn from our preliminary scaling analysis for QAE and VQE to make the case for QAE as a NISQ era contender to VQE for quantum chemistry. For the former, we pick the representative example of computing avoided crossings in the H4 molecule in a rectangular geometry, and demonstrate that we obtain results to within about 1.2% of the full configuration interaction value on the D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Following our numerical results, we carry out a detailed yet preliminary analysis of the scaling behaviours of both the QAE and the VQE algorithms. We analyze the non-recurring and recurring costs involved in both the algorithms and arrive at their net scaling behaviours.</description>

      <title>Can Charge Transfer Across C-H...O Hydrogen Bonds Stabilize Oil Droplets in Water?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oil-water emulsions resist aggregation due to the presence of negative charges at their surface that leads to mutual repulsion between droplets, but the molecular origin of oil charge is currently under debate. While much evidence has suggested that ionic species must accumulate at the interface, an alternative perspective attributes the negative charge on the oil droplet to charge transfer of electron density from water to oil molecules. While the charge transfer mechanism is consistent with the correct sign of oil charge, it is just as important to provide good estimates of the charge magnitude to explain emulsion stability and electrophoresis experiments. Here we show using energy decomposition analysis that the amount of net flow of charge from water to oil is negligibly small due to nearly equal forward and backward charge transfer through weak oil-water interactions, such that oil droplets would be unstable and coalesce, contrary to experiment. The lack of charge transfer also explains why vibrational sum frequency scattering reports a blue shift in the oil C-H frequency when forming emulsions with water, which arises from Pauli repulsion due to localized confinement at the interface. Finally, unlike ions, neither charge transfer nor dynamic polarization can produce a finite conductivity needed to couple to electric fields that would explain electrophoretic mobility.</description>

Abstract: New routes for transforming nitrogen into ammonia at ambient conditions would be a milestone toward an energy efficient and economically attractive production route in comparison to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. Recently, the synthesis of ammonia from water and nitrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure has been reported to be catalyzed by Fe3O4 at the air-water interface. By integrating ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics and free energy calculations, we investigate the underlying thermodynamic mechanisms governing ammonia and hydrazine formation at the water-Fe3O4-nanoparticle interface. We find that, unlike pure Fe3O4 where N2 can only interact with a limited number of Fe sites, hydroxylated species introduce large and diverse adsorption geometries where N2 can bind through either Fe sites or Fe-OH groups, each of which are capable of independently facilitating proton-coupled electron transfer.</description>

      <title>Improved Treatment of 1-4 interactions in Force Fields for Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional force fields commonly use a combination of bonded torsional terms and empirically scaled non-bonded interactions to capture 1-4 energies and forces of atoms separated by three bonds in a molecule. While this approach can yield accurate torsional energy barriers, it often leads to inaccurate forces and erroneous geometries, and creates an interdependence between dihedral terms and non-bonded interactions, complicating parameterization and reducing transferability. In this paper, we demonstrate that 1-4 interactions can be accurately modeled using only bonded coupling terms, eliminating the need for arbitrarily scaled non-bonded interactions altogether. Furthermore by leveraging the automated parameterization capabilities of the Q-Force toolkit, we efficiently determine the necessary coupling terms without the need for manual adjustment. Our approach is first validated on a range of small molecule systems, encompassing both flexible and rigid structures, and shows a significant improvement in force field accuracy, obtaining sub-kcal/mol mean absolute error for every molecule tested. We further extend the bonded-only model for 1-4 interactions to Amber ff14sb, CHARMM36, and OPLS-AA force fields to reproduce ab initio gas and implicit solvent $\phi,\psi$ surfaces of alanine dipeptide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model Auger spectra using second-order M\o ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory combined with complex-scaled basis functions. For this purpose, we decompose the complex MP2 energy of the core-hole state into contributions from specific decay channels and propose a corresponding equation-of-motion (EOM) method for computing the doubly ionized final states of Auger decay. These methods lead to significant savings in computational cost compared to our recently developed approaches based on coupled-cluster theory [F. Matz and T.-C. Jagau, J. Chem. Phys. 156, 114117 (2022)].
  The test set for this study comprises water, ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, and silane. The energies of the final states of Auger decay are obtained with an accuracy comparable to EOM coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) theory. Partial decay widths and branching ratios between KLL, KLM, and KMM decay of K-shell holes in third-row hydrides are in good agreement with EOM-CCSD, while deviations are more significant for second-row hydrides. For L$_1$-shell holes, which undergo Coster-Kronig decay, MP2 yields unphysical results. However, we show that a suitable shift of the MP2 energy denominators leads to more reliable branching ratios and spectra for these problematic cases.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Forward and Inverse Potential-Density Mappings in Classical Density Functional Theory</title>

Abstract: Neural operators are capable of capturing nonlinear mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, offering a data-driven approach to modeling complex functional relationships in classical density functional theory (cDFT). In this work, we evaluate the performance of several neural operator architectures in learning the functional relationships between the one-body density profile $\rho(x)$, the one-body direct correlation function $c_1(x)$, and the external potential $V_{ext}(x)$ of inhomogeneous one-dimensional (1D) hard-rod fluids, using training data generated from analytical solutions of the underlying statistical-mechanical model. We compared their performance in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss in establishing the functional relationships as well as in predicting the excess free energy across two test sets: (1) a group test set generated via random cross-validation (CV) to assess interpolation capability, and (2) a newly constructed dataset for leave-one-group CV to evaluate extrapolation performance. Our results show that FNO achieves the most accurate predictions of the excess free energy, with the squared ReLU activation function outperforming other activation choices. Among the DeepONet variants, the Residual Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (RMSCNN) combined with a trainable Gaussian derivative kernel (GK-RMSCNN-DeepONet) demonstrates the best performance. Additionally, we applied the trained models to solve for the density profiles at various external potentials and compared the results with those obtained from the direct mapping $V_{ext} \mapsto \rho$ with neural operators, as well as with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) combined with Active Learning by Error Control (ALEC), which has shown strong performance in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computation of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2), and accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</description>

      <title>A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning of Molecular Energies with Hybrid Quantum-Neural Wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computational chemistry holds great promise for simulating molecular systems more efficiently than classical methods by leveraging quantum bits to represent molecular wavefunctions. However, current implementations face significant limitations in accuracy due to hardware noise and algorithmic constraints. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns molecular wavefunction using a combination of an efficient quantum circuit and a deep neural network. This approach enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, surpassing traditional quantum computational chemistry methods. Numerical benchmarking on molecular systems shows that our hybrid quantum-neural wavefunction approach achieves near-chemical accuracy, comparable to advanced quantum and classical techniques. Experimental validation on a superconducting quantum computer, using the isomerization reaction of cyclobutadiene, further demonstrates its practical applicability, with high accuracy in energy estimation and significant resilience to noise.</description>

      <title>Scalable Autoregressive 3D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models of 3D molecular structure play a rapidly growing role in the design and simulation of molecules. Diffusion models currently dominate the space of 3D molecule generation, while autoregressive models have trailed behind. In this work, we present Quetzal, a simple but scalable autoregressive model that builds molecules atom-by-atom in 3D. Treating each molecule as an ordered sequence of atoms, Quetzal combines a causal transformer that predicts the next atom's discrete type with a smaller Diffusion MLP that models the continuous next-position distribution. Compared to existing autoregressive baselines, Quetzal achieves substantial improvements in generation quality and is competitive with the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. In addition, by reducing the number of expensive forward passes through a dense transformer, Quetzal enables significantly faster generation speed, as well as exact divergence-based likelihood computation. Finally, without any architectural changes, Quetzal natively handles variable-size tasks like hydrogen decoration and scaffold completion. We hope that our work motivates a perspective on scalability and generality for generative modelling of 3D molecules.</description>

      <title>Elastic Metastability: Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions in Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The morphological snap-through transition of a bistable elastic structure typically requires external loading, unless it is miniaturized to the nanoscale, where thermal fluctuations play a significant role. We propose that metastability can emerge in microscopic elastic systems when coupled to a thermal environment, giving rise to thermally activated transitions between metastable configurations. Using atomistic simulations combined with rare event methods, we demonstrate that snap-through events can occur as well-defined thermally activated transitions in a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon. Well-tempered metadynamics is employed to determine the transition energetics and pathways. Notably, the temperature dependence of the transition rate constant is accurately described by generalized transition state theory in terms of the Landau free energy. This study introduces a theoretical framework for understanding elastic metastability, extends reaction rate theory to nanomechanical systems, and suggests strategies for designing temperature-responsive nanodevices.</description>
