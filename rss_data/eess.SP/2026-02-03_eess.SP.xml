      <title>JSR-GFNet: Jamming-to-Signal Ratio-Aware Dynamic Gating for Interference Classification in future Cognitive Global Navigation Satellite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition toward cognitive global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers requires accurate interference classification to trigger adaptive mitigation strategies. However, conventional methods relying on Time-Frequency Analysis (TFA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face two fundamental limitations: severe performance degradation in low Jamming-to-Signal Ratio (JSR) regimes due to noise obscuration, and ``feature degeneracy'' caused by the loss of phase information in magnitude-only spectrograms. Consequently, spectrally similar signals -- such as high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation versus Band-Limited Gaussian Noise -- become indistinguishable. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the \textbf{JSR-Guided Fusion Network (JSR-GFNet)}. This multi-modal architecture combines phase-sensitive complex In-Phase/Quadrature (IQ) samples with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms. Central to this framework is a physics-inspired dynamic gating mechanism driven by statistical signal descriptors. Acting as a conditional controller, it autonomously estimates signal reliability to dynamically reweight the contributions of a Complex-Valued ResNet (IQ stream) and an EfficientNet backbone (STFT stream). To validate the model, we introduce the Comprehensive GNSS Interference (CGI-21) dataset, simulating 21 jamming categories including software-defined waveforms from aerial platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JSR-GFNet achieves higher accuracy across the full 10--50 dB JSR spectrum. Notably, interpretability analysis confirms that the model learns a physically intuitive strategy: prioritizing spectral energy integration in noise-limited regimes while shifting focus to phase precision in high-SNR scenarios to resolve modulation ambiguities. This framework provides a robust solution for next-generation aerospace navigation security.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of SBFD ISAC in an FR3 Distributed SIMO Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for future radio networks. This paper presents a sub-band full-duplex (SBFD) ISAC system that assigns non-overlapping OFDM subbands to sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous operation with minimal interference. A distributed testbed with three SIMO nodes is implemented using USRP X410 devices operating at 6.8 GHz with 20 MHz bandwidth per channel. A total of 2048 OFDM subcarriers are partitioned into three subbands: two for sensing using Zadoff-Chu sequences and one for communication using QPSK. Each USRP transmits one subband while receiving signals across all three, forming a 1 x 3 SIMO node. Time synchronization is achieved through host-server coordination without external clock distribution. Indoor measurements, validated against MOCAP ground truth, confirm the feasibility of the SBFD ISAC system. The results demonstrate monostatic sensing with a velocity resolution of 0.145 m/s, and communication under NLoS conditions with a BER of 3.63e-3. Compared with a multiband benchmark requiring three times more spectrum, the SBFD configuration achieves comparable velocity estimation accuracy while conserving resources. The sensing and communication performance trade-off is determined by subcarrier allocation strategy rather than mutual interference.</description>

      <title>Dual-Tier IRS-Assisted Mid-Band 6G Mobile Networks: Robust Beamforming and User Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications necessitates robust resource allocation in future sixth-generation (6G) networks, particularly at the upper mid-band (7-15 GHz, FR3). This paper presents a novel intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS)-assisted framework combining terrestrial IRS (TIRS) and aerial IRS (AIRS) mounted on low-altitude platform stations, to ensure reliable connectivity under severe line-of-sight (LoS) blockages. Distinguishing itself from prior work restricted to terrestrial IRS and mmWave and THz bands, this work targets the FR3 spectrum, the so-called Golden Band for 6G. The joint beamforming and user association (JBUA) problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), solved through problem decomposition, zero-forcing beamforming, and a stable matching algorithm. Comprehensive simulations show our method approaches exhaustive search performance with significantly lower complexity, outperforming existing greedy and random baselines. These results provide a scalable blueprint for real-world 6G deployments, supporting massive IoT connectivity in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Reliable IoT Communications in 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks with Dual RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) applications has accelerated the need for robust resource allocation in sixth-generation (6G) networks. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted upper mid-band communication framework. To ensure robust connectivity under severe line-of-sight (LoS) blockages, we use a two-tier RIS structure comprising terrestrial RISs (TRISs) and high-altitude platform station (HAPS)-mounted RISs (HRISs). To maximize network sum rate, we formulate a joint beamforming, power allocation, and IoT device association (JBPDA) problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). The formulated MINLP problem is challenging to solve directly; therefore, we tackle it via a decomposition approach. The zero-forcing (ZF) technique is used to optimize the beamforming matrix, a closed-form expression for power allocation is derived, and a stable matching-based algorithm is proposed for device-RIS association based on achievable data rates. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme approaches the performance of exhaustive search (ES) while exhibiting substantially lower complexity, and it consistently outperforms greedy search (GS) and random search (RS) baselines. Moreover, the proposed scheme converges much faster than the ES scheme.</description>

      <title>Fronthaul-Efficient Distributed Cooperative 3D Positioning with Quantized Latent CSI Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision three-dimensional (3D) positioning in dense urban non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments benefits significantly from cooperation among multiple distributed base stations (BSs). However, forwarding raw CSI from multiple BSs to a central unit (CU) incurs prohibitive fronthaul overhead, which limits scalable cooperative positioning in practice. This paper proposes a learning-based edge-cloud cooperative positioning framework under limited-capacity fronthaul constraints. In the proposed architecture, a neural network is deployed at each BS to compress the locally estimated CSI into a quantized representation subject to a fixed fronthaul payload. The quantized CSI is transmitted to the CU, which performs cooperative 3D positioning by jointly processing the compressed CSI received from multiple BSs. The proposed framework adopts a two-stage training strategy consisting of self-supervised local training at the BSs and end-to-end joint training for positioning at the CU. Simulation results based on a 3.5~GHz 5G NR compliant urban ray-tracing scenario with six BSs and 20~MHz bandwidth show that the proposed method achieves a mean 3D positioning error of 0.48~m and a 90th-percentile error of 0.83~m, while reducing the fronthaul payload to 6.25% of lossless CSI forwarding. The achieved performance is close to that of cooperative positioning with full CSI exchange.</description>

      <title>CMANet: Channel-Masked Attention Network for Cooperative Multi-Base-Station 3D Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving ubiquitous high-accuracy localization is crucial for next-generation wireless systems, yet remains challenging in multipath-rich urban environments. By exploiting the fine-grained multipath characteristics embedded in channel state information (CSI), more reliable and precise localization can be achieved. To address this, we present CMANet, a multi-BS cooperative positioning architecture that performs feature-level fusion of raw CSI using the proposed Channel Masked Attention (CMA) mechanism. The CMA encoder injects a physically grounded prior--per-BS channel gain--into the attention weights, thus emphasizing reliable links and suppressing spurious multipath. A lightweight LSTM decoder then treats subcarriers as a sequence to accumulate frequency-domain evidence into a final 3D position estimate. In a typical 5G NR-compliant urban simulation, CMANet achieves less than 0.5m median error and 1.0m 90th-percentile error, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablations verify the necessity of CMA and frequency accumulation. CMANet is edge-deployable and exemplifies an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)-aligned, cooperative paradigm for multi-BS CSI positioning.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Differential and Collision Entropy for Finite-Regime QKD in Hybrid Quantum Noisy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a comparative study between three fundamental entropic measures, differential entropy, quantum Renyi entropy, and quantum collision entropy for a hybrid quantum channel (HQC) was investigated, where hybrid quantum noise (HQN) is characterized by both discrete and continuous variables (CV) noise components. Using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to statistically model the HQN, we construct as well as visualize the corresponding pointwise entropic functions in a given 3D probabilistic landscape. When integrated over the relevant state space, these entropic surfaces yield values of the respective global entropy. Through analytical and numerical evaluation, it is demonstrated that the differential entropy approaches the quantum collision entropy under certain mixing conditions, which aligns with the Renyi entropy for order $\alpha = 2$. Within the HQC framework, the results establish a theoretical and computational equivalence between these measures. This provides a unified perspective on quantifying uncertainty in hybrid quantum communication systems. Extending the analysis to the operational domain of finite key QKD, we demonstrated that the same $10\%$ approximation threshold corresponds to an order-of-magnitude change in Eves success probability and a measurable reduction in the secure key rate.</description>

      <title>Denoising deterministic networks using iterative Fourier transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail a novel Fourier-based approach (IterativeFT) for identifying deterministic network structure in the presence of both edge pruning and Gaussian noise. This technique involves the iterative execution of forward and inverse 2D discrete Fourier transforms on a target network adjacency matrix. The denoising ability of the method is achieved via the application of a sparsification operation to both the real and frequency domain representations of the adjacency matrix with algorithm convergence achieved when the real domain sparsity pattern stabilizes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we apply it to noisy versions of several deterministic models including Kautz, lattice, tree and bipartite networks. For contrast, we also evaluate preferential attachment networks to illustrate the behavior on stochastic graphs. We compare the performance of IterativeFT against simple real domain and frequency domain thresholding, reduced rank reconstruction and locally adaptive network sparsification. Relative to the comparison network denoising approaches, the proposed IterativeFT method provides the best overall performance for lattice and Kuatz networks with competitive performance on tree and bipartite networks. Importantly, the InterativeFT technique is effective at both filtering noisy edges and recovering true edges that are missing from the observed network.</description>

      <title>Calibration-Free Induced Magnetic Field Indoor and Outdoor Positioning via Data-Driven Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Induced magnetic field (IMF)-based localization offers a robust alternative to wave-based positioning technologies due to its resilience to non-line-of-sight conditions, environmental dynamics, and wireless interference. However, existing magnetic localization systems typically rely on analytical field inversion, manual calibration, or environment-specific fingerprinting, limiting their scalability and transferability. This paper presents a data-driven IMF localization framework that directly maps induced magnetic field measurements to spatial coordinates using supervised learning, eliminating explicit environment-specific calibration. By replacing explicit field modeling with learning-based inference, the proposed approach captures nonlinear field interactions and environmental effects. An orientation-invariant feature representation enables rotation-independent deployment. The system is evaluated across multiple indoor environments and an outdoor deployment. Benchmarking against classical and deep learning baselines shows that a Random Forest regressor achieves sub-20 cm accuracy in 2D and sub-30 cm in 3D localization. Cross-environment validation demonstrates that models trained indoors generalize to outdoor environments without retraining. We further analyze scalability by varying transmitter spacing, showing that coverage and accuracy can be balanced through deployment density. Overall, this work demonstrates that data-driven IMF localization is a scalable and transferable solution for real-world positioning.</description>

      <title>mmWave Sensing for Detecting Movement Through Thermoplastic Masks During Radiation Therapy Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision in radiation therapy relies on immobilization systems that limit patient motion. Thermoplastic masks are commonly used for this purpose, but subtle voluntary and involuntary movements such as jaw shifts, deep breathing, or eye squinting may still compromise treatment accuracy. Existing motion tracking methods are limited: optical systems require a clear line of sight and only detect surface motion, while X-ray-based tracking introduces additional ionizing radiation. This study explores the use of low-power, non-ionizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing for through-mask motion detection. We characterize the RF properties of thermoplastic mask material in the 28-38 GHz range and perform motion detection using a 1 GHz bandwidth centered at 28 GHz. We use a frequency-domain system with horn antennas in a custom-built anechoic chamber to capture changes in the amplitude and phase of transmitted RF waves in response to subtle head and facial movements. These findings lay groundwork for future real-time through-mask motion tracking and future integration with multi-antenna systems and machine learning for error correction during radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Channel Modeling and Experimental Validation of Odor-Based Molecular Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odor-based Molecular Communication (OMC) employs odor molecules to convey information, contributing to the realization of the Internet of Everything (IoE) vision. Despite this, the practical deployment of OMC systems is currently limited by the lack of comprehensive channel models that accurately characterize particle propagation in diverse environments. While existing literature explores various aspects of molecular transport, a holistic approach that integrates theoretical modeling with experimental validation for bounded channels remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing mathematical frameworks for both bounded and unbounded OMC channels. To verify the accuracy of the proposed models, we develop a novel experimental testbed and conduct an extensive performance analysis. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between the theoretical derivations and experimental data, providing a robust foundation for the design and analysis of future end-to-end OMC systems.</description>

      <title>Digital and Hybrid Precoding and RF Chain Selection Designs for Energy Efficient Multi-User MIMO-OFDM ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has attracted considerable attention in recent years. While most existing works focus on improving MIMO-OFDM ISAC performance, the impact of transmit power and radio-frequency (RF) circuit power consumption on energy efficiency (EE) remains relatively underexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates joint precoding and RF chain selection for multi-user MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems, and develops energy-efficient designs for both fully digital and hybrid precoding architectures through the joint optimization of precoding and RF-chain activation. Specifically, we first formulate a novel EE maximization problem subject to sensing performance constraints. Then, efficient optimization algorithms are proposed for both architectures, together with analyses of their computational complexity and convergence behavior. Building on the proposed approaches, spectral efficiency-power consumption tradeoff designs are also provided. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with existing schemes, the proposed approaches achieve significant improvements in the EE-sensing tradeoff for ISAC systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio Foundation Models (AFMs), a specialized category of Generative AI (GenAI), have the potential to transform signal processing (SP) education by integrating core applications such as speech and audio enhancement, denoising, source separation, feature extraction, automatic classification, and real-time signal analysis into learning and research. This paper introduces SPEduAFM, a conceptual AFM tailored for SP education, bridging traditional SP principles with GenAI-driven innovations. Through an envisioned case study, we outline how AFMs can enable a range of applications, including automated lecture transcription, interactive demonstrations, and inclusive learning tools, showcasing their potential to transform abstract concepts into engaging, practical experiences. This paper also addresses challenges such as ethics, explainability, and customization by highlighting dynamic, real-time auditory interactions that foster experiential and authentic learning. By presenting SPEduAFM as a forward-looking vision, we aim to inspire broader adoption of GenAI in engineering education, enhancing accessibility, engagement, and innovation in the classroom and beyond.</description>

      <title>Mismatch Analysis and Cooperative Calibration of Array Beam Patterns for ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key technology for enabling a wide range of applications in future wireless systems. However, the sensing performance is often degraded by model mismatches caused by geometric errors (e.g., position and orientation) and hardware impairments (e.g., mutual coupling and amplifier non-linearity). This paper focuses on the angle estimation performance with antenna arrays and tackles the critical challenge of array beam pattern calibration for ISAC systems. To assess calibration quality from a sensing perspective, a novel performance metric that accounts for angle estimation error, rather than beam pattern similarity, is proposed and incorporated into a differentiable loss function. Additionally, a cooperative calibration framework is introduced, allowing multiple user equipments to iteratively optimize the beam pattern based on the proposed loss functions and local data, and collaboratively update global calibration parameters. The proposed models and algorithms are validated using real-world beam pattern measurements collected in an anechoic chamber. Experimental results show that the angle estimation error can be reduced from {$\textbf{1.01}^\circ$} to $\textbf{0.11}^\circ$ in 2D calibration scenarios, and from $\textbf{5.19}^\circ$ to $\textbf{0.86}^\circ$ in 3D calibration ones.</description>

      <title>Approximating Univariate Factored Distributions via Message-Passing Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) commonly arise in communication systems, particularly in bilinear joint estimation and detection problems. Although the product of GMMs is still a GMM, as the number of factors increases, the number of components in the resulting product GMM grows exponentially. To obtain a tractable approximation for a univariate factored probability density function (PDF), such as a product of GMMs, we investigate iterative message-passing algorithms. Based on Belief Propagation (BP), we propose a Variable Duplication and Gaussian Belief Propagation (VDBP)-based algorithm. The key idea of VDBP is to construct a multivariate measurement model whose marginal posterior is equal to the given univariate factored PDF. We then apply Gaussian BP (GaBP) to transform the global inference problem into local ones. Expectation propagation (EP) is another branch of message passing algorithms. In addition to converting the global approximation problem into local ones, it features a projection operation that ensures the intermediate functions (messages) belong to a desired family. Due to this projection, EP can be used to approximate the factored PDF directly. However, even if every factor is integrable, the division operation in EP may still cause the algorithm to fail when the mean and variance of a non-integrable belief are required. Therefore, this paper proposes two methods that combine EP with our previously proposed techniques for handling non-integrable beliefs to approximate univariate factored distributions.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Positioning With Lam\'e Curve LEDs: A Generic Approach for Camera Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera-based visible light positioning (VLP) is a promising technique for accurate and low-cost indoor camera pose estimation (CPE). To reduce the number of required light-emitting diodes (LEDs), advanced methods commonly exploit LED shape features for positioning. Although interesting, they are typically restricted to a single LED geometry, leading to failure in heterogeneous LED-shape scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates Lam\'e curves as a unified representation of common LED shapes and proposes a generic VLP algorithm using Lam\'e curve-shaped LEDs, termed LC-VLP. In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted Lam\'e curve-shaped LEDs periodically broadcast their curve parameters via visible light communication, which are captured by a camera-equipped receiver. Based on the received LED images and curve parameters, the receiver can estimate the camera pose using LC-VLP. Specifically, an LED database is constructed offline to store the curve parameters, while online positioning is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem and solved iteratively. To provide a reliable initialization, a correspondence-free perspective-\textit{n}-points (FreeP\textit{n}P) algorithm is further developed, enabling approximate CPE without any pre-calibrated reference points. The performance of LC-VLP is verified by both simulations and experiments. Simulations show that LC-VLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both circular- and rectangular-LED scenarios, achieving reductions of over 40% in position error and 25% in rotation error. Experiments further show that LC-VLP can achieve an average position accuracy of less than 4 cm.</description>

      <title>Synthesized-Isotropic Narrowband Channel Parameter Extraction from Angle-Resolved Wideband Channel Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved channel sounding using antenna arrays or mechanically steered high-gain antennas is widely employed at millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. To extract antenna-independent large-scale channel parameters such as path loss, delay spread, and angular spread, the radiation-pattern effects embedded in the measured responses must be properly compensated. This paper revisits the technical challenges of path-gain calculation from angle-resolved wideband measurements, with emphasis on angular-domain power integration where the scan beams are inherently non-orthogonal and simple power summation leads to biased omni-equivalent power estimates. We first formulate the synthesized-isotropic narrowband power in a unified matrix form and introduce a beam-accumulation correction factor, including an offset-averaged variant to mitigate scalloping due to off-grid angles. The proposed framework is validated through simulations using channel models and 154~GHz corridor measurements.</description>

      <title>Resolution-Aliasing Trade-off in Near-Field Localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely Large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems operating in Near-Field (NF) introduce new degrees of freedom for accurate source localisation, but make dense arrays impractical. Sparse or distributed arrays can reduce hardware complexity while maintaining high resolution, yet sub-Nyquist spatial sampling introduces aliasing artefacts in the localisation ambiguity function. This paper presents a unified framework to jointly characterise resolution and aliasing in NF localisation and study the trade-off between the two. Leveraging the concept of local chirp spatial frequency, we derive analytical expressions linking array geometry and sampling density to the spatial bandwidth of the received field. We introduce two geometric tools--Critical Antenna Elements (CAEs) and the Non-Contributive Zone (NCZ)--to intuitively identify how individual antennas contribute to resolution and/or aliasing. Our analysis reveals that resolution and aliasing are not always strictly coupled, e.g., increasing the array aperture can improve resolution without necessarily aggravating aliasing. These results provide practical guidelines for designing NF arrays that optimally balance resolution and aliasing, supporting efficient XL-MIMO deployment.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Weighted Multi-Task CNN for Joint DoA and Rain-Rate Estimation Under Rain-Induced Array Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate joint direction-of-arrival (DoA) and rain-rate estimation for a uniform linear array operating under rain-induced multiplicative distortions. Building on a wavefront fluctuation model whose spatial correlation is governed by the rain-rate, we derive an angle-dependent covariance formulation and use it to synthesize training data. DoA estimation is cast as a multi-label classification problem on a discretized angular grid, while rain-rate estimation is formulated as a multi-class classification task. We then propose a multi-task deep CNN with a shared feature extractor and two task-specific heads, trained using an uncertainty-weighted objective to automatically balance the two losses. Numerical results in a two-source scenario show that the proposed network achieves lower DoA RMSE than classical baselines and provides accurate rain-rate classification at moderate-to-high SNRs.</description>

      <title>Obstacle Detection at Level Crossings under Adverse Weather Conditions -- A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Level crossing accidents remain a significant safety concern in modern railway systems, particularly under adverse weather conditions that degrade sensor performance. This review surveys state-of-the-art sensor technologies and fusion strategies for obstacle detection at railway level crossings, with a focus on robustness, detection accuracy, and environmental resilience. Individual sensors such as inductive loops, cameras, radar, and LiDAR offer complementary strengths but involve trade-offs, including material dependence, reduced visibility, and limited resolution in harsh environments. We analyze each modality's working principles, weather-induced vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies, including signal enhancement and machine-learning-based denoising. We further review multi-sensor fusion approaches, categorized as data-level, feature-level, and decision-level architectures, that integrate complementary information to improve reliability and fault tolerance. The survey concludes with future research directions, including adaptive fusion algorithms, real-time processing pipelines, and weather-resilient datasets to support the deployment of intelligent, fail-safe detection systems for railway safety.</description>

      <title>Silhouette Score Efficient Radio Frequency Fingerprint Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification technology, which exploits relatively stable hardware imperfections, is highly susceptible to constantly changing channel effects. Although various channel-robust RFF feature extraction methods have been proposed, they predominantly rely on experimental comparisons rather than theoretical analyses. This limitation hinders the progress of channel-robust RFF feature extraction and impedes the establishment of theoretical guidance for its design. In this paper, we establish a unified theoretical performance analysis framework for different RFF feature extraction methods using the silhouette score as an evaluation metric, and propose a precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method that enhances the silhouette score without requiring channel estimation. First, we employ the silhouette score as an evaluation metric and obtain the theoretical performance of various RFF feature extraction methods using the Taylor series expansion. Next, we mitigate channel effects by computing the reciprocal of the received signal in the frequency domain at the device under authentication. We then compare these methods across three different scenarios: the deterministic channel scenario, the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) stochastic channel scenario, and the non-i.i.d. stochastic channel scenario. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the silhouette score is an efficient metric to evaluate classification accuracy. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method achieves the highest silhouette score and classification accuracy under channel variations.</description>

      <title>Neurophysiological effects of museum modalities on emotional engagement with real artworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Museums increasingly rely on digital content to support visitors' understanding of artworks, yet little is known about how these formats shape the emotional engagement that underlies meaningful art experiences. This research presents an in-situ EEG study on how digital interpretive content modulate engagement during art viewing. Participants experienced three modalities: direct viewing of a Bruegel painting, a 180{\deg} immersive interpretive projection, and a regular, display-based interpretive video. Frontal EEG markers of motivational orientation, internal involvement, perceptual drive, and arousal were extracted using eyes-open baselines and Z-normalized contrasts. Results show modality-specific engagement profiles: display-based interpretive video induced high arousal and fast-band activity, immersive projections promoted calm, presence-oriented absorption, and original artworks reflected internally regulated engagement. These findings, relying on lightweight EEG sensing in an operational cultural environment, suggest that digital interpretive content affects engagement style rather than quantity. This paves the way for new multimodal sensing approaches and enables museums to optimize the modalities and content of their interpretive media.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Wireless Amodal Sensing for Single-View 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amodal sensing is critical for various real-world sensing applications because it can recover the complete shapes of partially occluded objects in complex environments. Among various amodal sensing paradigms, wireless amodal sensing is a potential solution due to its advantages of environmental robustness, privacy preservation, and low cost. However, the sensing data obtained by wireless system is sparse for shape reconstruction because of the low spatial resolution, and this issue is further intensified in complex environments with occlusion. To address this issue, we propose a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless amodal sensing scheme that leverages a large-scale RIS to enhance the spatial resolution and create reflection paths that can bypass the obstacles. A generative learning model is also employed to reconstruct the complete shape based on the sensing data captured from the viewpoint of the RIS. In such a system, it is challenging to optimize the RIS phase shifts because the relationship between RIS phase shifts and amodal sensing accuracy is complex and the closed-form expression is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we develop an error prediction model that learns the mapping from RIS phase shifts to amodal sensing accuracy, and optimizes RIS phase shifts based on this mapping. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show that our method achieves at least a 56.73% reduction in reconstruction error compared to conventional schemes under the same number of RIS configurations.</description>

      <title>Real-Time 2D LiDAR Object Detection Using Three-Frame RGB Scan Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor service robots need perception that is robust, more privacy-friendly than RGB video, and feasible on embedded hardware. We present a camera-free 2D LiDAR object detection pipeline that encodes short-term temporal context by stacking three consecutive scans as RGB channels, yielding a compact YOLOv8n input without occupancy-grid construction while preserving angular structure and motion cues. Evaluated in Webots across 160 randomized indoor scenarios with strict scenario-level holdout, the method achieves 98.4% mAP@0.5 (0.778 mAP@0.5:0.95) with 94.9% precision and 94.7% recall on four object classes. On a Raspberry Pi 5, it runs in real time with a mean post-warm-up end-to-end latency of 47.8ms per frame, including scan encoding and postprocessing. Relative to a closely related occupancy-grid LiDAR-YOLO pipeline reported on the same platform, the proposed representation is associated with substantially lower reported end-to-end latency. Although results are simulation-based, they suggest that lightweight temporal encoding can enable accurate and real-time LiDAR-only detection for embedded indoor robotics without capturing RGB appearance.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Free Diffusion Transformers for Low-Complexity MIMO Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion model-based channel estimators have shown impressive performance but suffer from high computational complexity because they rely on iterative reverse sampling. This paper proposes a sampling-free diffusion transformer (DiT) for low-complexity MIMO channel estimation, termed SF-DiT-CE. Exploiting angular-domain sparsity of MIMO channels, we train a lightweight DiT to directly predict the clean channels from their perturbed observations and noise levels. At inference, the least square (LS) estimate and estimation noise condition the DiT to recover the channel in a single forward pass, eliminating iterative sampling. Numerical results demonstrate that our method achieves superior estimation accuracy and robustness with significantly lower complexity than state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>A Novel ISAC Waveform Based on Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing with FMCW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation with frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) (ODDM-FMCW) waveform to enable integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We first propose a square-root-Nyquist-filtered FMCW (SRN-FMCW) waveform to address limitations of conventional linear FMCW waveforms in ISAC systems. To better integrate with ODDM, we generate SRN-FMCW by embedding symbols in the DD domain, referred to as a DD-SRN-FMCW frame. A DD chirp compression receiver is designed to obtain the channel response efficiently. Next, we construct the proposed ODDM-FMCW waveform for ISAC by superimposing a DD-SRN-FMCW frame onto an ODDM data frame. A comprehensive performance analysis of the ODDM-FMCW waveform is presented, covering peak-to-average power ratio, spectrum, ambiguity function, and Cramer-Rao bound for delay and Doppler estimation. Numerical results show that the proposed ODDM-FMCW waveform delivers excellent ISAC performance in terms of root mean square error for sensing and bit error rate for communications.</description>

Abstract: Analog multiplexing appears to be a promising solution for modern transmitters, where speed is the primary limitation. The objective is the development of a low-cost solution to compare different digital to analog (DAC) schemes. In particular, analog multiplexing techniques, high-speed single-DAC, Sigma-delta modulation, Dynamic element matching are considered. The work presents a review of these techniques and shows a prototype of a time interleaved sigma delta modulation based DAC based on a commercially available Field Programmable Gate Array system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the Trajectory-Information Exchange Multi-Bernoulli (T-IEMB) filter to estimate sets of alive and all trajectories in track-before-detect applications with generalised superpositional measurements. This measurement model has superpositional hidden variables which are mapped to the conditional mean and covariance of the measurement, enabling it to describe a broad range of measurement models. This paper also presents a Gaussian implementation of the T-IEMB filter, which performs the update by approximating the conditional moments of the measurement model, and admits a computationally light filtering solution. Simulation results for a non-Gaussian radar-based tracking scenario demonstrate the performance of two Gaussian T-IEMB implementations, which provide improved tracking performance compared to a state-of-the-art particle filter based solution for track-before-detect, at a reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Command and Control Transmission for Multi-UAVs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an important role in the low-altitude economy and have been used in various applications. However, with the increasing number of UAVs and explosive wireless data, the existing bit-oriented communication network has approached the Shannon capacity, which cannot satisfy the quality of service (QoS) with ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for command and control (C\&amp;C) transmission in bit-oriented UAV communication networks. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic-aware C\&amp;C transmission for multi-UAVs under limited wireless resources. Specifically, we leverage semantic similarity to measure the variation in C\&amp;C messages for each UAV over continuous transmission time intervals (TTIs) and capture the correlation of C\&amp;C messages among UAVs, enabling multicast transmission. Based on the semantic similarity and the importance of UAV commands, we design a trigger function to quantify the QoS of UAVs. Then, to maximize the long-term QoS and exploit multicast opportunities of C\&amp;C messages induced by semantic similarity, we develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to jointly determine the transmission mode (unicast/multicast/idle) and the allocation of limited resource blocks (RBs) between a base station (BS) and UAVs. Experimental results show that our proposed semantic-aware framework significantly increases transmission efficiency and improves effectiveness compared with bit-oriented UAV transmission.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Human Activity Recognition on Edge Microcontrollers: Dynamic Hierarchical Inference with Multi-Spectral Sensor Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for accurate on-device pattern recognition in edge applications is intensifying, yet existing approaches struggle to reconcile accuracy with computational constraints. To address this challenge, a resource-aware hierarchical network based on multi-spectral fusion and interpretable modules, namely the Hierarchical Parallel Pseudo-image Enhancement Fusion Network (HPPI-Net), is proposed for real-time, on-device Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Deployed on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller for low-power real-time inference, HPPI-Net achieves 96.70% accuracy while utilizing only 22.3 KiB of RAM and 439.5 KiB of ROM after optimization. HPPI-Net employs a two-layer architecture. The first layer extracts preliminary features using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrograms, while the second layer selectively activates either a dedicated module for stationary activity recognition or a parallel LSTM-MobileNet network (PLMN) for dynamic states. PLMN fuses FFT, Wavelet, and Gabor spectrograms through three parallel LSTM encoders and refines the concatenated features using Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC), thereby offering channel-level interpretability while substantially reducing multiply-accumulate operations. Compared with MobileNetV3, HPPI-Net improves accuracy by 1.22% and reduces RAM usage by 71.2% and ROM usage by 42.1%. These results demonstrate that HPPI-Net achieves a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off and provides explainable predictions, establishing a practical solution for wearable, industrial, and smart home HAR on memory-constrained edge platforms.</description>

      <title>A Renderer-Enabled Framework for Computing Parameter Estimation Lower Bounds in Plenoptic Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on assessing the information-theoretic limits of scene parameter estimation in plenoptic imaging systems. A general framework to compute lower bounds on the parameter estimation error from noisy plenoptic observations is presented, with a particular focus on passive indirect imaging problems, where the observations do not contain line-of-sight information about the parameter(s) of interest. Using computer graphics rendering software to synthesize the often-complicated dependence among parameter(s) of interest and observations, i.e. the forward model, the proposed framework evaluates the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to establish lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator of the unknown parameters. The effects of inexact rendering of the true forward model on the computed lower bounds are also analyzed, both theoretically and via simulations. Experimental evaluations compare the computed lower bounds with the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator on a canonical object localization problem, showing that the lower bounds computed via the framework proposed here are indicative of the true underlying fundamental limits in several nominally representative scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dual Quaternion SE(3) Synchronization with Recovery Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization over the special Euclidean group SE(3) aims to recover absolute poses from noisy pairwise relative transformations and is a core primitive in robotics and 3D vision. Standard approaches often require multi-step heuristic procedures to recover valid poses, which are difficult to analyze and typically lack theoretical guarantees. This paper adopts a dual quaternion representation and formulates SE(3) synchronization directly over the unit dual quaternion. A two-stage algorithm is developed: A spectral initializer computed via the power method on a Hermitian dual quaternion measurement matrix, followed by a dual quaternion generalized power method (DQGPM) that enforces feasibility through per-iteration projection. The estimation error bounds are established for spectral estimators, and DQGPM is shown to admit a finite-iteration error bound and achieves linear error contraction up to an explicit noise-dependent threshold. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world multi-scan point-set registration demonstrate that the proposed pipeline improves both accuracy and efficiency over representative matrix-based methods.</description>

      <title>LLMs as High-Dimensional Nonlinear Autoregressive Models with Attention: Training, Alignment and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures are typically described through collections of architectural components and training procedures, obscuring their underlying computational structure. This review article provides a concise mathematical reference for researchers seeking an explicit, equation-level description of LLM training, alignment, and generation. We formulate LLMs as high-dimensional nonlinear autoregressive models with attention-based dependencies. The framework encompasses pretraining via next-token prediction, alignment methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), rejection sampling fine-tuning (RSFT), and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), as well as autoregressive generation during inference. Self-attention emerges naturally as a repeated bilinear--softmax--linear composition, yielding highly expressive sequence models. This formulation enables principled analysis of alignment-induced behaviors (including sycophancy), inference-time phenomena (such as hallucination, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation), and extensions like continual learning, while serving as a concise reference for interpretation and further theoretical development.</description>

      <title>Three-Way Emotion Classification of EEG-based Signals using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used technique for measuring brain activity. EEG-based signals can reveal a persons emotional state, as they directly reflect activity in different brain regions. Emotion-aware systems and EEG-based emotion recognition are a growing research area. This paper presents how machine learning (ML) models categorize a limited dataset of EEG signals into three different classes, namely Negative, Neutral, or Positive. It also presents the complete workflow, including data preprocessing and comparison of ML models. To understand which ML classification model works best for this kind of problem, we train and test the following three commonly used models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The performance of each is evaluated with respect to accuracy and F1-score. The results indicate that ML models can be effectively utilized for three-way emotion classification of EEG signals. Among the three ML models trained on the available dataset, the RF model gave the best results. Its higher accuracy and F1-score suggest that it is able to capture the emotional patterns more accurately and effectively than the other two models. The RF model also outperformed the existing state-of-the-art classification models in terms of the accuracy parameter.</description>

      <title>The Syntactic-Semantic Internet:Engineering Infrastructures for Autonomous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet has evolved through successive architectural abstractions that enabled unprecedented scale, interoperability, and innovation. Packet-based networking enabled the reliable transport of bits; cloud-native systems enabled the orchestration of distributed computation. Today, the emergence of autonomous, learning-based systems introduces a new architectural challenge: intelligence is increasingly embedded directly into network control, computation, and decision-making, yet the Internet lacks a structural foundation for representing and exchanging meaning. In this paper, we argue that cognition alone: pattern recognition, prediction, and optimization, is insufficient for the next generation of networked systems. As autonomous agents act across safety-critical and socio-technical domains, systems must not only compute and communicate, but also comprehend intent, context, and consequence. We introduce the concept of a Semantic Layer: a new architectural stratum that treats meaning as a first-class construct, enabling interpretive alignment, semantic accountability, and intelligible autonomous behavior. We show that this evolution leads naturally to a Syntactic-Semantic Internet. The syntactic stack continues to transport bits, packets, and workloads with speed and reliability, while a parallel semantic stack transports meaning, grounding, and consequence. We describe the structure of this semantic stack-semantic communication, a semantic substrate, and an emerging Agentic Web, and draw explicit architectural parallels to TCP/IP and the World Wide Web. Finally, we examine current industry efforts, identify critical architectural gaps, and outline the engineering challenges required to make semantic interoperability a global, interoperable infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Multi-Agent Continual Learning for Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), composed of multiple layers of reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces, are gaining prominence as a transformative technology for future wireless communication security. This paper investigates the integration of SIM into multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to enhance physical layer security. A novel system architecture is proposed, wherein each base station (BS) antenna transmits a dedicated single-user stream, while a multi-layer SIM executes wave-based beamforming in the electromagnetic domain, thereby avoiding the need for complex baseband digital precoding and significantly reducing hardware overhead. To maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR), we formulate a joint precoding optimization problem over BS power allocation and SIM phase shifts, which is high-dimensional and non-convex due to the complexity of the objective function and the coupling among optimization variables. To address this, we propose a manifold-enhanced heterogeneous multi-agent continual learning (MHACL) framework that incorporates gradient representation and dual-scale policy optimization to achieve robust performance in dynamic environments with high demands for secure communication. Furthermore, we develop SIM-MHACL (SIMHACL), a low-complexity learning template that embeds phase coordination into a product manifold structure, reducing the exponential search space to linear complexity while maintaining physical feasibility. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework achieves millisecond-level per-iteratio ntraining in SIM-assisted systems, significantly outperforming various baseline schemes, with SIMHACL achieving comparable WSSR to MHACL while reducing computation time by 30\%.</description>

      <title>Time2Vec-Integrated Transformer for Robust Gesture Recognition from Low-Density sEMG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and responsive myoelectric prosthesis control typically relies on complex, dense multi-sensor arrays, which limits consumer accessibility. This paper presents a novel, data-efficient deep learning framework designed to achieve precise and accurate control using minimal sensor hardware. Leveraging an external dataset of 8 subjects, our approach implements a hybrid Transformer optimized for sparse, two-channel surface electromyography (sEMG). Unlike standard architectures that use fixed positional encodings, we integrate Time2Vec learnable temporal embeddings to capture the stochastic temporal warping inherent in biological signals. Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations. A two-stage curriculum learning protocol is utilized to ensure robust feature extraction despite data scarcity. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-the-art multi-subject F1-score of 95.7% $\pm$ 0.20% for a 10-class movement set, statistically outperforming both a standard Transformer with fixed encodings and a recurrent CNN-LSTM model. Architectural optimization reveals that a balanced allocation of model capacity between spatial and temporal dimensions yields the highest stability. Furthermore, while direct transfer to a new unseen subject led to poor accuracy due to domain shifts, a rapid calibration protocol utilizing only two trials per gesture recovered performance from 21.0% $\pm$ 2.98% to 96.9% $\pm$ 0.52%. By validating that high-fidelity temporal embeddings can compensate for low spatial resolution, this work challenges the necessity of high-density sensing. The proposed framework offers a robust, cost-effective blueprint for next-generation prosthetic interfaces capable of rapid personalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of monitoring model performance in dynamic environments where labeled data are limited. To this end, we propose prediction-powered risk monitoring (PPRM), a semi-supervised risk-monitoring approach based on prediction-powered inference (PPI). PPRM constructs anytime-valid lower bounds on the running risk by combining synthetic labels with a small set of true labels. Harmful shifts are detected via a threshold-based comparison with an upper bound on the nominal risk, satisfying assumption-free finite-sample guarantees in the probability of false alarm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PPRM through extensive experiments on image classification, large language model (LLM), and telecommunications monitoring tasks.</description>

      <title>Age-Aware Edge-Blind Federated Learning via Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study federated learning (FL) over wireless fading channels where multiple devices simultaneously send their model updates. We propose an efficient \emph{age-aware edge-blind over-the-air FL} approach that does not require channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Instead, the parameter server (PS) uses multiple antennas and applies maximum-ratio combining (MRC) based on its estimated sum of the channel gains to detect the parameter updates. A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \emph{AgeTop-\(k\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \(k\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency. We provide a convergence bound that highlights the advantages of using a higher number of antenna array elements and demonstrates a key trade-off: increasing \(k\) decreases compression error at the cost of increasing the effect of channel noise. Experimental results show that (i) more PS antennas greatly improve accuracy and convergence speed; (ii) AgeTop-\(k\) outperforms random selection under relatively good channel conditions; and (iii) the optimum \(k\) depends on the channel, with smaller \(k\) being better in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS): Optimization-Based or Learning-Based?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS)-enabled downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) framework is proposed. PASS consists of multiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous low-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate signals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change both the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the novel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to adaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference mitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both optimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the optimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex complex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then invokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which enables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning dual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Transformer algorithm is developed, which captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and channel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework significantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve over 20% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a millisecond-level response on modern GPUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Low Altitude Economy (LAE) network, with its transformative capabilities, is a candidate to become one of the major technological developments of the next decade for air mobility. However, the expected unprecedented density, mobility, and heterogeneity pose challenges and require new approaches, as it renders traditional rule-based approaches inadequate. To address these challenges, this study introduces artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches and validation frameworks for transitioning AI-enabled technologies from simulation-based studies to practical and deployable systems. This study discusses essential enablers for intelligent LAE networks. First, AI-based spectrum sensing and coexistence utilizing the distributed nature of LAE nodes is introduced. Then, joint resource allocation and trajectory optimization driven by reinforcement learning is discussed. Bridging the gap between simulation and deployment through experimental platforms such as Aerial Experiments and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW), which are critical for validating models under realistic and non-stationary airspace conditions, is also addressed. The study concludes by highlighting open issues and outlining a forward-looking roadmap for the development of efficient, interoperable, and scalable AI-driven LAE ecosystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand high-performance error-correcting codes and decoders in the finite blocklength regime. This letter introduces a novel two-stage near-maximum likelihood (near-ML) decoding framework applicable to any linear block code. Our approach first employs a low-complexity initial decoder. If this initial stage fails a cyclic redundancy check, it triggers a second stage: the proposed code-weight sphere decoding (WSD). WSD iteratively refines the codeword estimate by exploring a localized sphere of candidates constructed from pre-computed low-weight codewords. This strategy adaptively minimizes computational overhead at high signal-to-noise ratios while achieving near-ML performance, especially for low-rate codes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our two-stage decoder provides an excellent trade-off between decoding reliability and complexity, establishing it as a promising solution for next-generation URLLC systems.</description>

      <title>Increasing Data Rate through Shaping on Wireless Channels Subject to Mobility and Delay Spread</title>

Abstract: This letter describes how to improve performance of cellular systems by combining non-equiprobable signaling (shaping) with low-density parity check (LDPC) coding for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system. We focus on improving performance at the cell edge, where the 5G standard specifies a suite of LDPC codes with different rates that are applied to 4-QAM. We employ the method of shaping on rings which adds to the transmission rate as it shapes the input distribution. We double the size of the $4$-QAM constellation by introducing a second shell of signal points, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects the high energy shell less frequently than the low energy shell. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We employ rate $1/2$ LDPC coding and select the rate of the shaping code to match that of rate $3/4$ LDPC coding using $4$-QAM. We present simulation results for a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. When we choose an LDPC code from the 5G suite to match the BER performance of rate $1/2$ LDPC coding with shaping we show that transmission rate can be improved by $20 $%.</description>

      <title>Distributed Uplink Anti-Jamming in LEO Mega-Constellations via Game-Theoretic Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have become vital in emerging commercial and defense Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, their predictable orbital dynamics and exposed geometries make them highly susceptible to ground-based jamming. Traditional single-satellite interference mitigation techniques struggle to spatially separate desired uplink signals from nearby jammers, even with large antenna arrays. This paper explores a distributed multi-satellite anti-jamming strategy leveraging the dense connectivity and high-speed inter-satellite links of modern LEO mega-constellations. We model the uplink interference scenario as a convex-concave game between a desired terrestrial transmitter and a jammer, each optimizing their spatial covariance matrices to maximize or minimize achievable rate. We propose an efficient min-max solver combining alternating best-response updates with projected gradient descent, achieving fast convergence of the beamforming strategy to the Nash equilibrium. Using realistic Starlink orbital geometries and Sionna ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate that while close-proximity jammers can cripple single-satellite links, distributed satellite cooperation significantly enhances resilience, shifting the capacity distribution upward under strong interference.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Channel Charting: An LSTM-AE-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of the sixth-generation (6G) communication system, Channel State Information (CSI) plays a crucial role in improving network performance. Traditional Channel Charting (CC) methods map high-dimensional CSI data to low-dimensional spaces to help reveal the geometric structure of wireless channels. However, most existing CC methods focus on learning static geometric structures and ignore the dynamic nature of the channel over time, leading to instability and poor topological consistency of the channel charting in complex environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel time-series channel charting approach based on the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Auto encoders (AE) (LSTM-AE-CC). This method incorporates a temporal modeling mechanism into the traditional CC framework, capturing temporal dependencies in CSI using LSTM and learning continuous latent representations with AE. The proposed method ensures both geometric consistency of the channel and explicit modeling of the time-varying properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional CC methods in various real-world communication scenarios, particularly in terms of channel charting stability, trajectory continuity, and long-term predictability.</description>

      <title>The envelope of a complex Gaussian random variable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03038v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The envelope of an elliptical Gaussian complex vector, or equivalently, the amplitude or norm of a bivariate normal random vector has application in many weather and signal processing contexts. We explicitly characterize its distribution in the general case through its probability density, cumulative distribution and moment generating function. Moments and limiting distributions are also derived. These derivations are exploited to also characterize the special cases where the bivariate Gaussian mean vector and covariance matrix have a simpler structure, providing new additional insights in many cases. Simulations illustrate the benefits of using our formulae over Monte Carlo methods. We also use our derivations to get a better initial characterization of the distribution of the observed values in structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets, and of wind speed.</description>

      <title>Joint Bayesian Parameter and Model Order Estimation for Low-Rank Probability Mass Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining a reliable estimate of the joint probability mass function (PMF) of a set of random variables from observed data is a significant objective in statistical signal processing and machine learning. Modelling the joint PMF as a tensor that admits a low-rank canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) has enabled the development of efficient PMF estimation algorithms. However, these algorithms require the rank (model order) of the tensor to be specified beforehand. In real-world applications, the true rank is unknown. Therefore, an appropriate rank is usually selected from a candidate set either by observing validation errors or by computing various likelihood-based information criteria, a procedure that could be costly in terms of computational time or hardware resources, or could result in mismatched models which affect the model accuracy. This paper presents a novel Bayesian framework for estimating the low-rank components of a joint PMF tensor and simultaneously inferring its rank from the observed data. We specify a Bayesian PMF estimation model and employ appropriate prior distributions for the model parameters, allowing the rank to be inferred without cross-validation.We then derive a deterministic solution based on variational inference (VI) to approximate the posterior distributions of various model parameters. Numerical experiments involving both synthetic data and real classification and item recommendation data illustrate the advantages of our VI-based method in terms of estimation accuracy, automatic rank detection, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>LEAD: An EEG Foundation Model for Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01678v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face three major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-based AD datasets for robust representation learning; 2) limited generalizability across subjects; and 3) difficulty in adapting to highly heterogeneous data. To address these challenges, we curate the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,238 subjects. Leveraging this unique resource, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Specifically, we design a gated temporal-spatial Transformer that can adapt to EEG recordings with arbitrary lengths, channel configurations, and sampling rates. In addition, we introduce a subject-regularized training strategy to enhance subject-level feature learning. We further employ medical contrastive learning for pre-training on 13 datasets, including 4 AD datasets and 9 non-AD neurological disorder datasets, and fine-tune/test the model on the other 5 AD datasets. LEAD achieves the best average ranking across all 20 evaluations on 5 downstream datasets, substantially outperforming existing approaches, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) EEG foundation models. These results strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and practical potential of the proposed method for real-world EEG-based AD detection.

      <title>SCAN-BEST: Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal Reliability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13801v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems adopt larger antenna arrays, near-field propagation becomes increasingly prominent, especially for users close to the transmitter. Traditional far-field beam training methods become inadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks due to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band training overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best mmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope with the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel Sub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps around any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal suboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk control (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its performance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between calibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical properties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Low-Rank Structures in the Training and Adaptation of Large Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The substantial computational demands of modern large-scale deep learning present significant challenges for efficient training and deployment. Recent research has revealed a widespread phenomenon wherein deep networks inherently learn low-rank structures in their weights and representations during training. This tutorial paper provides a comprehensive review of advances in exploiting these low-rank structures, bridging mathematical foundations with practical applications. We present two complementary theoretical perspectives on the emergence of low-rankness: viewing it through the optimization dynamics of gradient descent throughout training, and understanding it as a result of implicit regularization effects at convergence. Practically, these theoretical frameworks provide a foundation for understanding the success of techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in fine-tuning, inspire new parameter-efficient low-rank training strategies, and explain the effectiveness of masked training approaches like dropout and masked self-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Optimization for MIMO ISAC based on Prior Distribution Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) with transceiver hybrid analog-digital arrays transmits dual-functional signals to communicate with a multi-antenna user and simultaneously sense the unknown and random location information of a target based on the reflected echo signals and the prior distribution information on the target's location. Under transceiver hybrid arrays, we characterize the sensing performance by deriving the posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error which is a function of the transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming. We study joint transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming optimization to minimize the PCRB subject to a communication rate requirement. We first consider a sensing-only system and derive the optimal solution to each element in the transmit/receive analog beamforming matrices that minimizes the PCRB in closed form. Then, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm. Next, we study a narrowband MIMO ISAC system and devise an efficient AO-based hybrid beamforming algorithm by leveraging weighted minimum mean-squared error and feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation methods. Furthermore, we extend the results for narrowband systems to a MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid beamforming designs. It is revealed that the number of receive RF chains has more significant impact on the sensing performance than its transmit counterpart. Under a given budget on the total number of transmit/receive RF chains at the BS, the optimal number of transmit RF chains increases as the communication rate target increases due to the non-trivial PCRB-rate trade-off.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Low-Power Wake-Up Signal (LP-WUS) and Low-Power Synchronization Signal (LP-SS), introduced in 3GPP 5G-Advanced Release 19, mark an important advancement toward power-efficient IoT communications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the LP-WUS procedures in the RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states and summarizes the key physical-layer design aspects. The LP-WUS is intended to be detected by a low-power energy detector (ED), allowing the main radio (MR) to remain switched off, thereby enabling substantial power savings compared to conventional 5G paging mechanisms. As such, LP-WUS is considered the baseline for 6G WUS design. Furthermore, different receiver architectures are evaluated, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between power-saving gains and coverage performance.</description>

      <title>Minimization of Nonsmooth Weakly Convex Function over Prox-regular Set for Robust Low-rank Matrix Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a prox-regular-type low-rank constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization model for Robust Low-Rank Matrix Recovery (RLRMR), i.e., estimate problem of low-rank matrix from an observed signal corrupted by outliers. For RLRMR, the $\ell_{1}$-norm has been utilized as a convex loss to detect outliers as well as to keep tractability of optimization models. Nevertheless, the $\ell_{1}$-norm is not necessarily an ideal robust loss because the $\ell_{1}$-norm tends to overpenalize entries corrupted by outliers of large magnitude. In contrast, the proposed model can employ a weakly convex function as a more robust loss, against outliers, than the $\ell_{1}$-norm. For the proposed model, we present (i) a projected variable smoothing-type algorithm applicable for the minimization of a nonsmooth weakly convex function over a prox-regular set, and (ii) a convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm in terms of stationary point. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with the existing models that employ the $\ell_{1}$-norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a novel framework for stable GAN training using the Bayes optimal learning threshold (BOLT). The discriminator is trained via the BOLT loss under a standard 1-Lipschitz constraint. This guides the generator to maximize the Bayes error of the discrimination task. We show that the training objective in this case represents a class of metrics on probability measures controlled by a 1-Lipschitz discriminator minimizing an integral probability metric that is upper-bounded by Wasserstein-1 distance. Across four standard image-generation benchmarks, BOLT-GAN improves FID and precision/recall over benchmark GAN frameworks under identical architectures and training budgets. Our experimental findings further confirm the advantage of linking the GAN training objective to a min-max Bayes error criterion.</description>

      <title>VecComp: Vector Computing via MIMO Digital Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such, VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over noisy and fading multiple-access channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates wireless systems aided by dual-polarized intelligent surfaces. We compare reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which adjust their reflection matrices, with movable signals operating with fixed intelligent surface (FIS), which adjust the signal frequency while the surface properties remain fixed. For both RIS and FIS, we consider surfaces with a diagonal reflection matrix, named diagonal RIS/FIS, and surfaces with a reflection matrix not limited to being diagonal, named beyond-diagonal RIS/FIS. Movable signals with FIS always outperform RIS, achieving at least a fourfold gain. When transmitter and receiver polarizations differ, beyond-diagonal FIS further enhances performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate material identification plays a crucial role in embodied AI systems, enabling a wide range of applications. However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment. RF-MatID aims to enable reproducible research, accelerate algorithmic advancement, foster cross-domain robustness, and support the development of real-world application in RF-based material identification.</description>
