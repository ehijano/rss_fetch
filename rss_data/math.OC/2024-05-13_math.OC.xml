      <title>Prescribed Time Dual-Mode Extremum Seeking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dual mode extremum seeking control design technique that achieves real-time optimization of an unknown measured cost function in a prescribed time. The controller is shown to achieve semi-global practical stability of the optimal equilibrium for the state variables and the input variable for a class of nonlinear dynamical control systems with unknown dynamics. The design technique proposes a timescale transformation that enables the use of dither signals with increasing frequencies. The proposed timescale transformation is designed to avoid the singularity occurring at the prescribed time. A simulation study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>On Almost-Type Special Structured Tensor Classes Associated with Semi-Positive Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce almost (strictly) semi-positive tensors, which extend the concept of almost (strictly) semimonotone matrices. Furthermore, we provide insights into the characteristics of the entries within these almost (strictly) semi-positive tensors and establish a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for categorizing the underlying tensor as an almost semi-positive tensor. Drawing inspiration from H. V\"{a}liaho's work on copositivity, we present the concept of almost (strictly) copositive tensors, which extends the notion of almost (strictly) copositive matrices to tensors. It is shown that a real symmetric tensor is almost (strictly) semi-positive if and only if it is almost (strictly) copositive and a symmetric almost (strictly) semi-positive tensor has a (nonpositive) negative $H^{++}$-eigenvalue. We also establish a relationship between (strictly) diagonally dominant and (strong) $\mathcal{M}$-tensors with (strictly) semi-positive tensors.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-Newton Primal-Dual Algorithm with Line Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Newton methods refer to a class of algorithms at the interface between first and second order methods. They aim to progress as substantially as second order methods per iteration, while maintaining the computational complexity of first order methods. The approximation of second order information by first order derivatives can be expressed as adopting a variable metric, which for (limited memory) quasi-Newton methods is of type ``identity $\pm$ low rank''. This paper continues the effort to make these powerful methods available for non-smooth systems occurring, for example, in large scale Machine Learning applications by exploiting this special structure. We develop a line search variant of a recently introduced quasi-Newton primal-dual algorithm, which adds significant flexibility, admits larger steps per iteration, and circumvents the complicated precalculation of a certain operator norm. We prove convergence, including convergence rates, for our proposed method and outperform related algorithms in a large scale image deblurring application.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trade Characterizations in Multi-Asset Crypto-Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the mathematical study of constant function market makers. We rigorously establish the conditions for optimal trading under the assumption of a quasilinear, but not necessarily convex (or concave), trade function. This generalizes previous results that used convexity, and also guarantees the robustness against arbitrage of so-designed automatic market makers. The theoretical results are illustrated by families of examples given by generalized means, and also by numerical simulations in certain concrete cases. These simulations along with the mathematical analysis suggest that the quasilinear-trade-function based automatic market makers might replicate the functioning of those based on convex functions, in particular regarding their resilience to arbitrage.</description>

      <title>Newsvendor under Mean-Variance Ambiguity and Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a newsvendor problem with an unknown demand distribution. When addressing the issue of distributional uncertainty, we distinguish ambiguity under which the newsvendor does not differentiate demand distributions of common distributional characteristics (e.g., mean and variance) and misspecification under which such characteristics might be misspecified (due to, e.g., estimation error and/or distribution shift). The newsvendor hedges against ambiguity and misspecification by maximizing the worst-case expected profit regularized by a distribution's distance to an ambiguity set of distributions with some specified characteristics. Focusing on the popular mean-variance ambiguity set and optimal-transport cost for the misspecification, we show that the decision criterion of misspecification aversion possesses insightful interpretations as distributional transforms and convex risk measures. We derive the closed-form optimal order quantity that generalizes the solution of the seminal Scarf model under only ambiguity aversion. This highlights the impact of misspecification aversion: the optimal order quantity under misspecification aversion can decrease as the price or variance increases, reversing the monotonicity of that under only ambiguity aversion. Hence, ambiguity and misspecification, as different layers of distributional uncertainty, can result in distinct operational consequences. We quantify the finite-sample performance guarantee, which consists of two parts: the in-sample optimal value and the out-of-sample effect of misspecification that can be decoupled into estimation error and distribution shift. This theoretically justifies the necessity of incorporating misspecification aversion in a non-stationary environment, which is also well demonstrated in our experiments with real-world retailing data.</description>

      <title>Method of Successive Approximations for Stochastic Optimal Control: Contractivity and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Method of Successive Approximations (MSA) is a fixed-point iterative method used to solve stochastic optimal control problems. It is an indirect method based on the conditions derived from the Stochastic Maximum Principle (SMP), an extension of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) to stochastic control problems. In this study, we investigate the contractivity and the convergence of MSA for a specific and interesting class of stochastic dynamical systems (when the drift coefficient is one-sided-Lipschitz with a negative constant and the diffusion coefficient is Lipschitz continuous). Our analysis unfolds in three key steps: firstly, we prove the stability of the state process with respect to the control process. Secondly, we establish the stability of the adjoint process. Finally, we present rigorous evidence to prove the contractivity and then the convergence of MSA. This study contributes to enhancing the understanding of MSA's applicability and effectiveness in addressing stochastic optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Catastrophe Insurance: An Adaptive Robust Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating frequency and severity of natural disasters, exacerbated by climate change, underscore the critical role of insurance in facilitating recovery and promoting investments in risk reduction. This work introduces a novel Adaptive Robust Optimization (ARO) framework tailored for the calculation of catastrophe insurance premiums, with a case study applied to the United States National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time an ARO approach has been applied to for disaster insurance pricing. Our methodology is designed to protect against both historical and emerging risks, the latter predicted by machine learning models, thus directly incorporating amplified risks induced by climate change. Using the US flood insurance data as a case study, optimization models demonstrate effectiveness in covering losses and produce surpluses, with a smooth balance transition through parameter fine-tuning. Among tested optimization models, results show ARO models with conservative parameter values achieving low number of insolvent states with the least insurance premium charged. Overall, optimization frameworks offer versatility and generalizability, making it adaptable to a variety of natural disaster scenarios, such as wildfires, droughts, etc. This work not only advances the field of insurance premium modeling but also serves as a vital tool for policymakers and stakeholders in building resilience to the growing risks of natural catastrophes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Decentralized Stochastic Successive Convex Approximation for composite non-convex problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successive Convex approximation (SCA) methods have shown to improve the empirical convergence of non-convex optimization problems over proximal gradient-based methods. In decentralized optimization, which aims to optimize a global function using only local information, the SCA framework has been successfully applied to achieve improved convergence. Still, the stochastic first order (SFO) complexity of decentralized SCA algorithms has remained understudied. While non-asymptotic convergence analysis has been studied for decentralized deterministic settings, its stochastic counterpart has only been shown to converge asymptotically.
  We have analyzed a novel accelerated variant of the decentralized stochastic SCA that minimizes the sum of non-convex (possibly smooth) and convex (possibly non-smooth) cost functions. The algorithm viz. Decentralized Momentum-based Stochastic SCA (D-MSSCA), iteratively solves a series of strongly convex subproblems at each node using one sample at each iteration. The key step in non-asymptotic analysis involves proving that the average output state vector moves in the descent direction of the global function. This descent allows us to obtain a bound on average \textit{iterate progress} and \emph{mean-squared stationary gap}. The recursive momentum-based updates at each node contribute to achieving stochastic first order (SFO) complexity of O(\epsilon^{-3/2}) provided that the step sizes are smaller than the given upper bounds. Even with one sample used at each iteration and a non-adaptive step size, the rate is at par with the SFO complexity of decentralized state-of-the-art gradient-based algorithms. The rate also matches the lower bound for the centralized, unconstrained optimization problems. Through a synthetic example, the applicability of D-MSSCA is demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: We study decentralized control strategies for platoons of autonomous vehicles with heterogeneous and nonlinear dynamics. Based on ideas from funnel control, we present a novel decentralized control algorithm which is able to guarantee a safety distance between any two vehicles, a good traffic flow and it achieves string stability of the controlled platoon. We illustrate the performance of the controller by simulations of two extreme scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Class of Convex Optimization-Based Recursive Algorithms for Identification of Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on identification, this paper develops a class of convex optimization-based criteria and correspondingly the recursive algorithms to estimate the parameter vector $\theta^{*}$ of a stochastic dynamic system. Not only do the criteria include the classical least-squares estimator but also the $L_l=|\cdot|^l, l\geq 1$, the Huber, the Log-cosh, and the Quantile costs as special cases. First, we prove that the minimizers of the convex optimization-based criteria converge to $\theta^{*}$ with probability one. Second, the recursive algorithms are proposed to find the estimates, which minimize the convex optimization-based criteria, and it is shown that these estimates also converge to the true parameter vector with probability one. Numerical examples are given, justifying the performance of the proposed algorithms including the strong consistency of the estimates, the robustness against outliers in the observations, and higher efficiency in online computation compared with the kernel-based regularization method due to the recursive nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the synchronization problems for general high-dimensional linear networks over finite fields. By using the technique of linear transformations and invariant subspaces for linear spaces over finite fields, several necessary and sufficient conditions for the synchronization of high-dimensional linear networks over finite fields are proposed. This paper not only generalizes the existing results from 1-dimensional to high-dimensional linear networks but also adopts a new approach. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking in Aggregative Games over Jointly Connected and Weight-Balanced Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of the distributed Nash equilibrium seeking for aggregative games has been studied over strongly connected and weight-balanced static networks and every time strongly connected and weight-balanced switching networks. In this paper, we further study the same problem over jointly connected and weight-balanced networks. The existing approaches critically rely on the connectedness of the network for constructing a Lyapunov function for their algorithms and theses approaches fail if the network is not connected. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an approach to show the exponential convergence of the output of the closed-loop system to the unknown Nash equilibrium (NE) point under a set of mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Network Identifiability with Full Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive conditions for the identifiability of nonlinear networks characterized by additive dynamics at the level of the edges when all the nodes are excited. In contrast to linear systems, we show that the measurement of all sinks is necessary and sufficient for the identifiability of directed acyclic graphs, under the assumption that dynamics are described by analytic functions without constant terms (i.e., $f(0)=0$). But if constant terms are present, then the identifiability is impossible as soon as one node has more than one in-neighbor. In the case of general digraphs where cycles can exist, we consider additively separable functions for the analysis of the identifiability, and we show that the measurement of one node of all the sinks of the condensation digraph is necessary and sufficient. Several examples are added to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Arrow of Time in Estimation and Control: Duality Theory Beyond the Linear Gaussian Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duality between estimation and control is a foundational concept in Control Theory. Most students learn about the elementary duality -- between observability and controllability -- in their first graduate course in linear systems theory. Therefore, it comes as a surprise that for a more general class of nonlinear stochastic systems (hidden Markov models or HMMs), duality is incomplete.
  Our objective in writing this article is two-fold: (i) To describe the difficulty in extending duality to HMMs; and (ii) To discuss its recent resolution by the authors. A key message is that the main difficulty in extending duality comes from time reversal in going from estimation to control. The reason for time reversal is explained with the aid of the familiar linear deterministic and linear Gaussian models. The explanation is used to motivate the difference between the linear and the nonlinear models. Once the difference is understood, duality for HMMs is described based on our recent work. The article also includes a comparison and discussion of the different types of duality considered in literature.</description>

      <title>Duality-based single-level reformulations of bilevel optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usually, bilevel optimization problems need to be transformed into single-level ones in order to derive optimality conditions and solution algorithms. Among the available approaches, the replacement of the lower-level problem by means of duality relations became popular quite recently. We revisit three realizations of this idea which are based on the lower-level Lagrange, Wolfe, and Mond--Weir dual problem. The resulting single-level surrogate problems are equivalent to the original bilevel optimization problem from the viewpoint of global minimizers under mild assumptions. However, all these reformulations suffer from the appearance of so-called implicit variables, i.e., surrogate variables which do not enter the objective function but appear in the feasible set for modeling purposes. Treating implicit variables as explicit ones has been shown to be problematic when locally optimal solutions, stationary points, and applicable constraint qualifications are compared to the original problem. Indeed, we illustrate that the same difficulties have to be faced when using these duality-based reformulations. Furthermore, we show that the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification is likely to be violated at each feasible point of these reformulations, contrasting assertions in some recently published papers.</description>

      <title>On Minimum-Dispersion Control of Nonlinear Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work collects some methodological insights for numerical solution of a "minimum-dispersion" control problem for nonlinear stochastic differential equations, a particular relaxation of the covariance steering task. The main ingredient of our approach is the theoretical foundation called $\infty$-order variational analysis. This framework consists in establishing an exact representation of the increment ($\infty$-order variation) of the objective functional using the duality, implied by the transformation of the nonlinear stochastic control problem to a linear deterministic control of the Fokker-Planck equation. The resulting formula for the cost increment analytically represents a "law-feedback" control for the diffusion process. This control mechanism enables us to learn time-dependent coefficients for a predefined Markovian control structure using Monte Carlo simulations with a modest population of samples. Numerical experiments prove the vitality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Constructive reachability for linear control problems under conic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications requiring sparse or nonnegative controls, we investigate reachability properties of linear infinite-dimensional control problems under conic constraints. Relaxing the problem to convex constraints if the initial cone is not already convex, we provide a constructive approach based on minimising a properly defined dual functional, which covers both the approximate and exact reachability problems. Our main results heavily rely on convex analysis, Fenchel duality and the Fenchel-Rockafellar theorem. As a byproduct, we uncover new sufficient conditions for approximate and exact reachability under convex conic constraints. We also prove that these conditions are in fact necessary. When the constraints are nonconvex, our method leads to sufficient conditions ensuring that the constructed controls fulfill the original constraints, which is in the flavour of bang-bang type properties. We show that our approach encompasses and generalises several works, and we obtain new results for different types of conic constraints and control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply methods of the fixed point theory to a Lambda policy iteration with a randomization algorithm for weak contractions mappings. This type of mappings covers a broader range than the strong contractions typically considered in the literature, such as \'Ciri\'c contraction. Specifically, we explore the characteristics of reinforcement learning procedures developed for feedback control within the context of fixed point theory. Under relatively general assumptions, we identify the sufficient conditions for convergence with a probability of one in infinite-dimensional policy spaces.</description>

      <title>Adaptive first-order methods with enhanced worst-case rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Optimized Gradient Method (OGM), its strongly convex extension, the Information Theoretical Exact Method (ITEM), as well as the related Triple Momentum Method (TMM) have superior convergence guarantees when compared to the Fast Gradient Method but lack adaptivity and their derivation is incompatible with composite problems. In this work we introduce a slightly modified version of the estimate sequence that can be used to simultaneously derive OGM, ITEM and TMM while adding memory along with the ability to dynamically adjust the convergence guarantees at runtime. Our framework can be extended to the composite setup and we use it to construct an Enhanced Accelerated Composite Gradient Method equipped with fully-adaptive line-search.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of Superquantile-Constrained Optimization Through Implicit Scenario Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superquantiles have recently gained significant interest as a risk-aware metric for addressing fairness and distribution shifts in statistical learning and decision making problems. This paper introduces a fast, scalable and robust second-order computational framework to solve large-scale optimization problems with superquantile-based constraints. Unlike empirical risk minimization, superquantile-based optimization requires ranking random functions evaluated across all scenarios to compute the tail conditional expectation. While this tail-based feature might seem computationally unfriendly, it provides an advantageous setting for a semismooth-Newton-based augmented Lagrangian method. The superquantile operator effectively reduces the dimensions of the Newton systems since the tail expectation involves considerably fewer scenarios. Notably, the extra cost of obtaining relevant second-order information and performing matrix inversions is often comparable to, and sometimes even less than, the effort required for gradient computation. Our developed solver is particularly effective when the number of scenarios substantially exceeds the number of decision variables. In synthetic problems with linear and convex diagonal quadratic objectives, numerical experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by a large margin: It achieves speeds more than 750 times faster for linear and quadratic objectives than the alternating direction method of multipliers as implemented by OSQP for computing low-accuracy solutions. Additionally, it is up to 25 times faster for linear objectives and 70 times faster for quadratic objectives than the commercial solver Gurobi, and 20 times faster for linear objectives and 30 times faster for quadratic objectives than the Portfolio Safeguard optimization suite for high-accuracy solution computations.</description>

      <title>Partial Causal Detectability of Linear Descriptor Systems and Existence of Functional ODE Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of state estimation for linear time-invariant descriptor systems in their most general form. The estimator is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We introduce the notion of partial causal detectability and characterize this concept by means of a simple rank criterion involving the system coefficient matrices. Also, several equivalent characterizations for partial causal detectability are established. In addition, we prove that partial causal detectability is equivalent to the existence of functional ODE estimators. A numerical example is given to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Policy Iteration for Pareto-Optimal Policies in Stochastic Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general-sum stochastic games, a stationary Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) does not always exist, in which the leader maximizes leader's return for all the initial states when the follower takes the best response against the leader's policy. Existing methods of determining the SSEs require strong assumptions to guarantee the convergence and the coincidence of the limit with the SSE. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the performance at the fixed points of these methods is not reasonable when they are not SSEs. Herein, we introduced the concept of Pareto-optimality as a reasonable alternative to SSEs. We derive the policy improvement theorem for stochastic games with the best-response follower and propose an iterative algorithm to determine the Pareto-optimal policies based on it. Monotone improvement and convergence of the proposed approach are proved, and its convergence to SSEs is proved in a special case.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Optimization of Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers Considering Usage-Based Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a techno-economic optimization model for evaluating the design and operation of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, crucial for hydrogen production powered by variable renewable electricity. This model integrates a 0-D physics representation of the electrolyzer stack, complete mass and energy balances, operational constraints, and empirical data on use-dependent degradation. Utilizing a decomposition approach, the model predicts optimal electrolyzer size, operation, and necessary hydrogen storage to satisfy baseload demands across various technology and electricity price scenarios. Analysis for 2022 shows that including degradation effects raises the levelized cost of hydrogen from \$4.56/kg to \$6.60/kg and decreases stack life to two years. However, projections for 2030 anticipate a significant reduction in costs to approximately \$2.50/kg due to lower capital expenses, leading to larger stacks, extended lifetimes, and less hydrogen storage. This approach is adaptable to other electrochemical systems relevant for decarbonization.</description>

      <title>Tuning parameter selection for the adaptive nuclear norm regularized trace regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularized models have been applied in lots of areas, with high-dimensional data sets being popular. Because tuning parameter decides the theoretical performance and computational efficiency of the regularized models, tuning parameter selection is a basic and important issue. We consider the tuning parameter selection for adaptive nuclear norm regularized trace regression, which achieves by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The proposed BIC is established with the help of an unbiased estimator of degrees of freedom. Under some regularized conditions, this BIC is proved to achieve the rank consistency of the tuning parameter selection. That is the model solution under selected tuning parameter converges to the true solution and has the same rank with that of the true solution in probability. Some numerical results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed BIC on tuning parameter selection.</description>

      <title>Robust Online Convex Optimization for Disturbance Rejection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online convex optimization (OCO) is a powerful tool for learning sequential data, making it ideal for high precision control applications where the disturbances are arbitrary and unknown in advance. However, the ability of OCO-based controllers to accurately learn the disturbance while maintaining closed-loop stability relies on having an accurate model of the plant. This paper studies the performance of OCO-based controllers for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to disturbance and model uncertainty. The model uncertainty can cause the closed-loop to become unstable. We provide a sufficient condition for robust stability based on the small gain theorem. This condition is easily incorporated as an on-line constraint in the OCO controller. Finally, we verify via numerical simulations that imposing the robust stability condition on the OCO controller ensures closed-loop stability.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient and Robust Task Selection for Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-learning methods typically learn tasks under the assumption that all tasks are equally important. However, this assumption is often not valid. In real-world applications, tasks can vary both in their importance during different training stages and in whether they contain noisy labeled data or not, making a uniform approach suboptimal. To address these issues, we propose the Data-Efficient and Robust Task Selection (DERTS) algorithm, which can be incorporated into both gradient and metric-based meta-learning algorithms. DERTS selects weighted subsets of tasks from task pools by minimizing the approximation error of the full gradient of task pools in the meta-training stage. The selected tasks are efficient for rapid training and robust towards noisy label scenarios. Unlike existing algorithms, DERTS does not require any architecture modification for training and can handle noisy label data in both the support and query sets. Analysis of DERTS shows that the algorithm follows similar training dynamics as learning on the full task pools. Experiments show that DERTS outperforms existing sampling strategies for meta-learning on both gradient-based and metric-based meta-learning algorithms in limited data budget and noisy task settings.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct zero loss neural network classifiers. We write the weight matrices and bias vectors in terms of cumulative parameters, which determine truncation maps acting recursively on input space. The configurations for the training data considered are (i) sufficiently small, well separated clusters corresponding to each class, and (ii) equivalence classes which are sequentially linearly separable. In the best case, for $Q$ classes of data in $\mathbb{R}^M$, global minimizers can be described with $Q(M+2)$ parameters.</description>

      <title>A geometric decomposition of finite games: Convergence vs. recurrence under no-regret learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of the complexity of the dynamics of no-regret learning in games, we seek to decompose a finite game into simpler components where the day-to-day behavior of the dynamics is well understood. A natural starting point for this is Helmholtz's theorem, which resolves a vector field into a potential and an incompressible component. However, the geometry of no-regret dynamics - and, in particular, the dynamics of exponential / multiplicative weights (EW) schemes - is not compatible with the Euclidean underpinnings of Helmholtz's theorem, leading us to consider a Riemannian framework based on the Shahshahani metric. Using this geometric construction, we introduce the class of incompressible games, and we prove the following results: First, in addition to being volume-preserving, the continuous-time EW dynamics in incompressible games admit a constant of motion and are Poincar\'e recurrent - i.e., almost every trajectory of play comes arbitrarily close to its starting point infinitely often. Second, we establish a deep connection with a well-known decomposition of games into a potential and harmonic component (where the players' objectives are aligned and anti-aligned respectively): a game is incompressible if and only if it is harmonic, implying in turn that the EW dynamics lead to Poincar\'e recurrence in harmonic games.</description>

      <title>Advocating Feedback Control for Human-Earth System Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a feedback control perspective for Human-Earth Systems (HESs) which essentially are complex systems that capture the interactions between humans and nature. Recent attention in HES research has been directed towards devising strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation, aimed at achieving environmental and societal objectives. However, existing approaches heavily rely on HES models, which inherently suffer from inaccuracies due to the complexity of the system. Moreover, overly detailed models often prove impractical for optimization tasks. We propose a framework inheriting from feedback control strategies the robustness against model errors, because inaccuracies are mitigated using measurements retrieved from the field. The framework comprises two nested control loops. The outer loop computes the optimal inputs to the HES, which are then implemented by actuators controlled in the inner loop. Potential fields of applications are also identified.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers a simplified model of open quantum systems undergoing imperfect measurements obtained via a projection filter approach. We use this approximate filter in the feedback stabilization problem specifically in the case of Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) measurements. The feedback design relies on the structure of the exponential family utilized for the projection process. We demonstrate that the introduced feedback guarantees exponential convergence of the original filter equation toward a predefined target state, corresponding to an eigenstate of the measurement operator.</description>

      <title>Networked Control with Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study feedback control of a dynamical process over a lossy channel equipped with a hybrid automatic repeat request protocol that connects a sensor to an actuator. The dynamical process is modeled by a Gauss-Markov process, and the lossy channel by a packet-erasure channel with ideal feedback. We suppose that data is communicated in the format of packets with negligible quantization error. In such a networked control system, whenever a packet loss occurs, there exists a tradeoff between transmitting new sensory information with a lower success probability and retransmitting previously failed sensory information with a higher success probability. In essence, an inherent tradeoff between freshness and reliability. To address this tradeoff, we consider a linear-quadratic-regulator performance index, which penalizes state deviations and control efforts over a finite horizon, and jointly design optimal policies for an encoder and a decoder, which are collocated with the sensor and the actuator, respectively. Our emphasis here lies specifically on designing switching and control policies, rather than error-correcting codes. We derive the structural properties of the optimal encoding and decoding policies. We show that the former is a threshold switching policy and the latter is a certainty-equivalent control policy. In addition, we specify the iterative equations that the encoder and the decoder need to solve in order to implement the optimal policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduction in coral reef densities, characterized by the proliferation of macroalgae, has emerged as a global threat. In this paper, we present a discrete-time coral reef dynamical model that incorporates macroalgae. We explore all ecologically possible equilibrium points for the proposed model. The conditions for the local stability of the interior equilibrium point are analyzed, which represents the coexistence of both coral and macroalgae. Furthermore, we investigate the model's behavior using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Our analysis reveals that the model undergoes codimension-one bifurcations, specifically period-doubling and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. To address the chaos resulting from the emergence of the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, we apply the OGY feedback control method and a hybrid control methodology. Finally, we provide numerical simulations not only to validate the obtained results but also to demonstrate the complex dynamic behaviors that arise. These behaviors include reversal period-doubling bifurcation, period-4, 8, and 24 bubble bifurcations, as well as chaotic behavior.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a new problem that can be solved by using the theory of a partially defined game. We consider the situation described below: first, we assume that the worth of the grand and singleton coalitions is only known. It take some amount of costs to obtain worth of larger coalitions. If it is performed, then players make a payment from the worth of the grand coalition. That is, the worth of the grand coalition is reduced by examinations of coalitional worth. The problem of a partially defined game with payments is finding the solution of partially defined games at each point and the best exiting rule of examinations of coalitional worth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.15350v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an infinite-horizon control problem, the optimal control can be represented by the stable manifold of the characteristic Hamiltonian system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in a semiglobal domain. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that if an approximation is sufficiently close to the exact stable manifold of the HJB equation in a certain sense, then the control derived from this approximation stabilizes the system and is nearly optimal. Then, based on the theoretical result, we propose a deep learning algorithm to approximate the stable manifold and compute optimal feedback control numerically. The algorithm relies on adaptive data generation through finding trajectories randomly within the stable manifold. Such kind of algorithm is grid-free basically, making it potentially applicable to a wide range of high-dimensional nonlinear systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through two examples: stabilizing the Reaction Wheel Pendulums and controlling the parabolic Allen-Cahn equation.</description>

      <title>Optimal and instance-dependent guarantees for Markovian linear stochastic approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stochastic approximation procedures for approximately solving a $d$-dimensional linear fixed point equation based on observing a trajectory of length $n$ from an ergodic Markov chain. We first exhibit a non-asymptotic bound of the order $t_{\mathrm{mix}} \tfrac{d}{n}$ on the squared error of the last iterate of a standard scheme, where $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is a mixing time. We then prove a non-asymptotic instance-dependent bound on a suitably averaged sequence of iterates, with a leading term that matches the local asymptotic minimax limit, including sharp dependence on the parameters $(d, t_{\mathrm{mix}})$ in the higher order terms. We complement these upper bounds with a non-asymptotic minimax lower bound that establishes the instance-optimality of the averaged SA estimator. We derive corollaries of these results for policy evaluation with Markov noise -- covering the TD($\lambda$) family of algorithms for all $\lambda \in [0, 1)$ -- and linear autoregressive models. Our instance-dependent characterizations open the door to the design of fine-grained model selection procedures for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., choosing the value of $\lambda$ when running the TD($\lambda$) algorithm).</description>

      <title>Stochastic Langevin Differential Inclusions with Applications to Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations of Langevin-diffusion form have received significant attention, thanks to their foundational role in both Bayesian sampling algorithms and optimization in machine learning. In the latter, they serve as a conceptual model of the stochastic gradient flow in training over-parameterized models. However, the literature typically assumes smoothness of the potential, whose gradient is the drift term. Nevertheless, there are many problems for which the potential function is not continuously differentiable, and hence the drift is not Lipschitz continuous everywhere. This is exemplified by robust losses and Rectified Linear Units in regression problems. In this paper, we show some foundational results regarding the flow and asymptotic properties of Langevin-type Stochastic Differential Inclusions under assumptions appropriate to the machine-learning settings. In particular, we show strong existence of the solution, as well as an asymptotic minimization of the canonical free-energy functional.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Type Methods For Decentralized Optimization Problems With Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz Condition Over Time-Varying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the decentralized optimization (minimization and saddle point) problems with objective functions that satisfy Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition (PL-condition). The first part of the paper is devoted to the minimization problem of the sum-type cost functions. In order to solve a such class of problems, we propose a gradient descent type method with a consensus projection procedure and the inexact gradient of the objectives. Next, in the second part, we study the saddle-point problem (SPP) with a structure of the sum, with objectives satisfying the two-sided PL-condition. To solve such SPP, we propose a generalization of the Multi-step Gradient Descent Ascent method with a consensus procedure, and inexact gradients of the objective function with respect to both variables. Finally, we present some of the numerical experiments, to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for the robust least squares problem.</description>

      <title>On the convergence analysis of the decentralized projected gradient descent method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we are concerned with the decentralized optimization problem: \begin{equation*} \min_{x \in \Omega}~f(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f_i (x), \end{equation*} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a convex domain and each $f_i : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a local cost function only known to agent $i$. A fundamental algorithm is the decentralized projected gradient method (DPG) given by \begin{equation*}
  x_i(t+1)=\mathcal{P}_\Omega\Big[\sum^n_{j=1}w_{ij} x_j(t) -\alpha(t)\nabla f_i(x_i(t))\Big] \end{equation*} where $\mathcal{P}_{\Omega}$ is the projection operator to $\Omega$ and $ \{w_{ij}\}_{1\leq i,j \leq n}$ are communication weight among the agents. While this method has been widely used in the literature, its convergence property has not been established so far, except for the special case $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n$. This work establishes new convergence estimates of DPG when the aggregate cost $f$ is strongly convex and each function $f_i$ is smooth. If the stepsize is given by constant $\alpha (t) \equiv\alpha &gt;0$ and suitably small, we prove that each $x_i (t)$ converges to an $O(\sqrt{\alpha})$-neighborhood of the optimal point. In addition, we further improve the convergence result by showing that the point $x_i (t)$ converges to an $O(\alpha)$-neighborhood of the optimal point if the domain is given the half-space $\mathbb{R}^{d-1}\times \mathbb{R}_{+}$ for any dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$. Also, we obtain new convergence results for decreasing stepsizes. Numerical experiments are provided to support the convergence results.</description>

      <title>An efficient solver for large-scale onshore wind farm siting including cable routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing planning approaches for onshore wind farm siting and grid integration often do not meet minimum cost solutions or social and environmental considerations. In this paper, we develop an exact approach for the integrated layout and cable routing problem of onshore wind farm planning using the Quota Steiner tree problem. Applying a novel transformation on a known directed cut formulation, reduction techniques, and heuristics, we design an exact solver that makes large problem instances solvable and outperforms generic MIP solvers. In selected regions of Germany, the trade-offs between minimizing costs and landscape impact of onshore wind farm siting are investigated. Although our case studies show large trade-offs between the objective criteria of cost and landscape impact, small burdens on one criterion can significantly improve the other criteria. In addition, we demonstrate that contrary to many approaches for exclusive turbine siting, grid integration must be simultaneously optimized to avoid excessive costs or landscape impacts in the course of a wind farm project. Our novel problem formulation and the developed solver can assist planners in decision-making and help optimize wind farms in large regions in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution presents substantial computational advancements to compare measures even with varying masses. Specifically, we utilize the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform to accelerate the radial kernel convolution in unbalanced optimal transport approximation, built upon the Sinkhorn algorithm. We also present accelerated schemes for maximum mean discrepancies involving kernels. Our approaches reduce the arithmetic operations needed to compute distances from $\mathcal O(n^2)$ to $\mathcal O(n\log n)$, opening the door to handle large and high-dimensional datasets efficiently. Furthermore, we establish robust connections between transportation problems, encompassing Wasserstein distance and unbalanced optimal transport, and maximum mean discrepancies. This empowers practitioners with compelling rationale to opt for adaptable distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader type algorithm is proposed and analyzed for solving general long-term constrained optimization problems in online manner, where the objective and constraints are arbitrarily generated and not necessarily convex. In each period, random linear perturbation and strongly concave perturbation are incorporated in primal and dual directions, respectively, to the offline oracle, and a global minimax point is searched as the solution. Based on a proposed expected static cumulative regret, we derive the first sublinear $O(T^{8/9})$ regret complexity for this class of problems. The proposed algorithm is applied to tackle a long-term (extreme value) constrained river pollutant source identification problem, validate the theoretical results and exhibit superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses three complex control challenges related to input-saturated systems from a data-driven perspective. Unlike the traditional two-stage process involving system identification and model-based control, the proposed approach eliminates the need for an explicit model description. The method combines data-based closed-loop representations, Lyapunov theory, instrumental variables, and a generalized sector condition to formulate data-driven linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). These LMIs are applied to maximize the origin's basin of attraction, minimize the closed-loop reachable set with bounded disturbances, and introduce a new data-driven $\ell_2$-gain minimization problem. Demonstrations on benchmark examples highlight the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach compared to an explicit identification of the system, emphasizing notable benefits in handling nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimization for unit commitment applied to the security of supply: extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmission system operators employ reserves to deal with unexpected variations of demand and generation to guarantee the security of supply. The French transmission system operator RTE dynamically sizes the required margins using a probabilistic approach relying on continuous forecasts of the main drivers of the uncertainties of the system imbalance and a 1 % risk threshold. However, this criterion does not specify which means to activate upward/downward and when to face a deficit of available margins versus the required margins. Thus, this work presents a strategy using a probabilistic unit commitment with a stochastic optimization-based approach, including the fixed and variable costs of units and the costs of lost load and production. The abstract problem is formulated with a multi-stage stochastic program and approximated with a heuristic called two-stage stochastic model predictive control. It solves a sequence of two-stage stochastic programs to conduct the central dispatch. An implementation is conducted by solving an approximated version with a single two-stage stochastic program. This method is tested on a real case study comprising nuclear and fossil-based units with French electrical consumption and renewable production.</description>

Abstract: We tackle the Optimal Experiment Design Problem, which consists of choosing experiments to run or observations to select from a finite set to estimate the parameters of a system. The objective is to maximize some measure of information gained about the system from the observations, leading to a convex integer optimization problem. We leverage Boscia.jl , a recent algorithmic framework, which is based on a nonlinear branch-and-bound algorithm with node relaxations solved to approximate optimality using Frank-Wolfe algorithms. One particular advantage of the method is its efficient utilization of the polytope formed by the original constraints which is preserved by the method, unlike alternative methods relying on epigraph-based formulations. We assess our method against both generic and specialized convex mixed-integer approaches. Computational results highlight the performance of our proposed method, especially on large and challenging instances.</description>

      <title>Fourth-order suboptimality of nominal model predictive control in the presence of uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the suboptimality resulting from the application of nominal model predictive control (MPC) to a nonlinear discrete time stochastic system. The suboptimality is defined with respect to the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem (OCP) that minimizes the expected cost of the closed loop system. In this context, nominal MPC corresponds to a form of certainty-equivalent control (CEC). We prove that, in a smooth and unconstrained setting, the suboptimality growth is of fourth order with respect to the level of uncertainty, a parameter which we can think of as a standard deviation. This implies that the suboptimality does not grow very quickly as the level of uncertainty is increased, providing further insight into the practical success of nominal MPC. Similarly, the difference between the optimal and suboptimal control inputs is of second order. We illustrate the result on a simple numerical example, which we also use to show how the proven relationship may cease to hold in the presence of state constraints.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the identification of linear time-invariant systems using noisy input-output data in a set-membership framework. It is assumed that the noise sequence belongs to a bounded set, induced by a quadratic matrix inequality, that allows for capturing various energy-bounded noise models. In this framework, the identification problem is to find an estimation for the true system so that the worst-case estimation error with respect to a given norm is minimized. For such a problem, we present closed-form solutions with respect to arbitrary unitarily invariant matrix norms. Examples of these norms include the Frobenius norm, spectral norm, nuclear norm, Schatten p-norms, and Ky Fan k-norms.</description>

Abstract: Leveraging on recent advancements on adaptive methods for convex minimization problems, this paper provides a linesearch-free proximal gradient framework for globalizing the convergence of popular stepsize choices such as Barzilai-Borwein and one-dimensional Anderson acceleration. This framework can cope with problems in which the gradient of the differentiable function is merely locally H\"older continuous. Our analysis not only encompasses but also refines existing results upon which it builds. The theory is corroborated by numerical evidence that showcases the synergetic interplay between fast stepsize selections and adaptive methods.</description>

Abstract: We consider the controllability problem for the continuity equation where the dynamics is governed by a driftless control-affine system. Under suitable regularity conditions, the controllability of the system is a sufficient condition for the controllability of the continuity equation by means of time-varying feedback controls. Moreover, we show that there exist controls such that the flow of the control system is the optimal transport map, for the 2-Wasserstein distance, between two given probability measures.</description>

      <title>Single-loop Projection-free and Projected Gradient-based Algorithms for Nonconvex-concave Saddle Point Problems with Bilevel Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a broad class of constrained saddle point problems with a bilevel structure, wherein the upper-level objective function is nonconvex-concave and smooth over compact and convex constraint sets, subject to a strongly convex lower-level objective function. This class of problems finds wide applicability in machine learning, encompassing robust multi-task learning, adversarial learning, and robust meta-learning. Our study extends the current literature in two main directions: (i) We consider a more general setting where the upper-level function is not necessarily strongly concave or linear in the maximization variable. (ii) While existing methods for solving saddle point problems with a bilevel structure are projected-based algorithms, we propose a one-sided projection-free method employing a linear minimization oracle. Specifically, by utilizing regularization and nested approximation techniques, we introduce a novel single-loop one-sided projection-free algorithm, requiring $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations to attain an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. Subsequently, we develop an efficient single-loop fully projected gradient-based algorithm capable of achieving an $\epsilon$-stationary solution within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-5}\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. When the upper-level objective function is linear in the maximization component, our results improve to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$, respectively. Finally, we tested our proposed methods against the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving a robust multi-task regression problem to showcase the superiority of our algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.03812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of restless bandit problems that finds a broad application area in reinforcement learning and stochastic optimization. We consider $N$ independent discrete-time Markov processes, each of which had two possible states: 1 and 0 (`good' and `bad'). Only if a process is both in state 1 and observed to be so does reward accrue. The aim is to maximize the expected discounted sum of returns over the infinite horizon subject to a constraint that only $M$ $(&lt;N)$ processes may be observed at each step. Observation is error-prone: there are known probabilities that state 1 (0) will be observed as 0 (1). From this one knows, at any time $t$, a probability that process $i$ is in state 1. The resulting system may be modeled as a restless multi-armed bandit problem with an information state space of uncountable cardinality. Restless bandit problems with even finite state spaces are PSPACE-HARD in general. We propose a novel approach for simplifying the dynamic programming equations of this class of restless bandits and develop a low-complexity algorithm that achieves a strong performance and is readily extensible to the general restless bandit model with observation errors. Under certain conditions, we establish the existence (indexability) of Whittle index and its equivalence to our algorithm. When those conditions do not hold, we show by numerical experiments the near-optimal performance of our algorithm in the general parametric space. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the optimality of our algorithm for homogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial-time Algorithm for the Large Scale of Airplane Refueling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11634v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Airplane refueling problem is a nonlinear unconstrained optimization problem with $n!$ feasible solutions. Given a fleet of $n$ airplanes with mid-air refueling technique, the question is to find the best refueling policy to make the last remaining airplane travels the farthest. In order to deal with the large scale of airplanes refueling instances, we proposed the definition of sequential feasible solution by employing the refueling properties of data structure. We proved that if an airplanes refueling instance has feasible solutions, it must have the sequential feasible solutions; and the optimal feasible solution must be the optimal sequential feasible solution. Then we proposed the sequential search algorithm which consists of two steps. The first step of the sequential search algorithm aims to seek out all of the sequential feasible solutions. When the input size of $n$ is greater than an index number, we proved that the number of the sequential feasible solutions will change to grow at a polynomial rate. The second step of the sequential search algorithm aims to search for the maximal sequential feasible solution by bubble sorting all of the sequential feasible solutions. Moreover, we built an efficient computability scheme, according to which we could forecast within a polynomial time the computational complexity of the sequential search algorithm that runs on any given airplanes refueling instance. Thus we could provide a computational strategy for decision makers or algorithm users by considering with their available computing resources.</description>

      <title>Sums of squares certificates for polynomial moment inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops the algebraic framework of moment polynomials, which are polynomial expressions in commuting variables and their formal mixed moments. Their positivity and optimization over probability measures supported on semialgebraic sets and subject to moment polynomial constraints is investigated. A positive solution to Hilbert's 17th problem for pseudo-moments is given. On the other hand, moment polynomials positive on actual measures are shown to be sums of squares and formal moments of squares up to arbitrarily small perturbation of their coefficients. When only measures supported on a bounded semialgebraic set are considered, a stronger algebraic certificate for moment polynomial positivity is derived. This result gives rise to a converging hierarchy of semidefinite programs for moment polynomial optimization. Finally, as an application, two open nonlinear Bell inequalities from quantum physics are settled.</description>

      <title>Gradient-type subspace iteration methods for the symmetric eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores variants of the subspace iteration algorithm for computing approximate invariant subspaces. The standard subspace iteration approach is revisited and new variants that exploit gradient-type techniques combined with a Grassmann manifold viewpoint are developed. A gradient method as well as a nonlinear conjugate gradient technique are described. Convergence of the gradient-based algorithm is analyzed and a few numerical experiments are reported, indicating that the proposed algorithms are sometimes superior to standard algorithms. This includes the Chebyshev-based subspace iteration and the locally optimal block conjugate gradient method, when compared in terms of number of matrix vector products and computational time, resp. The new methods, on the other hand, do not require estimating optimal parameters. An important contribution of this paper to achieve this good performance is the accurate and efficient implementation of an exact line search. In addition, new convergence proofs are presented for the non-accelerated gradient method that includes a locally exponential convergence if started in a $\mathcal{O(\sqrt{\delta})}$ neighbourhood of the dominant subspace with spectral gap $\delta$.</description>

      <title>Properties of Discrete Sliced Wasserstein Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10352v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance has become a popular alternative to the Wasserstein distance for comparing probability measures. Widespread applications include image processing, domain adaptation and generative modelling, where it is common to optimise some parameters in order to minimise SW, which serves as a loss function between discrete probability measures (since measures admitting densities are numerically unattainable). All these optimisation problems bear the same sub-problem, which is minimising the Sliced Wasserstein energy. In this paper we study the properties of $\mathcal{E}: Y \longmapsto \mathrm{SW}_2^2(\gamma_Y, \gamma_Z)$, i.e. the SW distance between two uniform discrete measures with the same amount of points as a function of the support $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ of one of the measures. We investigate the regularity and optimisation properties of this energy, as well as its Monte-Carlo approximation $\mathcal{E}_p$ (estimating the expectation in SW using only $p$ samples) and show convergence results on the critical points of $\mathcal{E}_p$ to those of $\mathcal{E}$, as well as an almost-sure uniform convergence and a uniform Central Limit result on the process $\mathcal{E}_p(Y)$. Finally, we show that in a certain sense, Stochastic Gradient Descent methods minimising $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{E}_p$ converge towards (Clarke) critical points of these energies.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for Stochastic Approximation: Biased Noise with Unbounded Variance, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the convergence properties of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method for finding a stationary point of a given objective function $J(\cdot)$. The objective function is not required to be convex. Rather, our results apply to a class of ``invex'' functions, which have the property that every stationary point is also a global minimizer. First, it is assumed that $J(\cdot)$ satisfies a property that is slightly weaker than the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition, denoted here as (KL'). It is shown that the iterations $J({\boldsymbol \theta}_t)$ converge almost surely to the global minimum of $J(\cdot)$. Next, the hypothesis on $J(\cdot)$ is strengthened from (KL') to the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. With this stronger hypothesis, we derive estimates on the rate of convergence of $J({\boldsymbol \theta}_t)$ to its limit. Using these results, we show that for functions satisfying the PL property, the convergence rate of SGD is the same as the best-possible rate for convex functions. While some results along these lines have been published in the past, our contributions contain two distinct improvements. First, the assumptions on the stochastic gradient are more general than elsewhere, and second, our convergence is almost sure, and not in expectation. We also study SGD when only function evaluations are permitted. In this setting, we determine the ``optimal'' increments or the size of the perturbations. Using the same set of ideas, we establish the global convergence of the Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm under more general assumptions on the measurement error, compared to the existing literature. We also derive bounds on the rate of convergence of the SA algorithm under appropriate assumptions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence theorem for longest paths in sub-Lorentzian problems, which generalizes the classical theorem for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. We specifically address the case of invariant structures on homogeneous spaces, as the conditions for the existence theorem in this case can be significantly simplified. In particular, it turns out that longest paths exist for any left-invariant sub-Lorentzian structures on Carnot groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents extensions of control barrier function (CBF) theory to systems with disturbances wherein a controller only receives measurements infrequently and operates open-loop between measurements, while still satisfying state constraints. The paper considers both impulsive and continuous actuators, and models the actuators, measurements, disturbances, and timing constraints as a hybrid dynamical system. We then design an open-loop observer that bounds the worst-case uncertainty between measurements. We develop definitions of CBFs for both actuation cases, and corresponding conditions on the control input to guarantee satisfaction of the state constraints. We apply these conditions to simulations of a satellite rendezvous in an elliptical orbit and autonomous orbit stationkeeping.</description>

      <title>Conjugate-Gradient-like Based Adaptive Moment Estimation Optimization Algorithm for Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks is a challenging task. In order to speed up training and enhance the performance of deep neural networks, we rectify the vanilla conjugate gradient as conjugate-gradient-like and incorporate it into the generic Adam, and thus propose a new optimization algorithm named CG-like-Adam for deep learning. Specifically, both the first-order and the second-order moment estimation of generic Adam are replaced by the conjugate-gradient-like. Convergence analysis handles the cases where the exponential moving average coefficient of the first-order moment estimation is constant and the first-order moment estimation is unbiased. Numerical experiments show the superiority of the proposed algorithm based on the CIFAR10/100 dataset.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Inferior Solutions For Superior Outcomes: Obtaining Robust Solutions From Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing domain of quantum optimization, the confluence of quantum algorithms such as Quantum Annealing (QA) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with robust optimization methodologies presents a cutting-edge frontier. Although it seems natural to apply quantum algorithms when facing uncertainty, this has barely been approached.
  In this paper we adapt the aforementioned quantum optimization techniques to tackle robust optimization problems. By leveraging the inherent stochasticity of quantum annealing and adjusting the parameters and evaluation functions within QAOA, we present two innovative methods for obtaining robust optimal solutions. These heuristics are applied on two use cases within the energy sector: the unit commitment problem, which is central to the scheduling of power plant operations, and the optimization of charging electric vehicles (EVs) including electricity from photovoltaic (PV) to minimize costs. These examples highlight not only the potential of quantum optimization methods to enhance decision-making in energy management but also the practical relevance of the young field of quantum computing in general. Through careful adaptation of quantum algorithms, we lay the foundation for exploring ways to achieve more reliable and efficient solutions in complex optimization scenarios that occur in the real-world.</description>

      <title>Work Smarter...Not Harder: Efficient Minimization of Dependency Length in SOV Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dependency length minimization is a universally observed quantitative property of natural languages. However, the extent of dependency length minimization, and the cognitive mechanisms through which the language processor achieves this minimization remain unclear. This research offers mechanistic insights by postulating that moving a short preverbal constituent next to the main verb explains preverbal constituent ordering decisions better than global minimization of dependency length in SOV languages. This approach constitutes a least-effort strategy because it's just one operation but simultaneously reduces the length of all preverbal dependencies linked to the main verb. We corroborate this strategy using large-scale corpus evidence across all seven SOV languages that are prominently represented in the Universal Dependency Treebank. These findings align with the concept of bounded rationality, where decision-making is influenced by 'quick-yet-economical' heuristics rather than exhaustive searches for optimal solutions. Overall, this work sheds light on the role of bounded rationality in linguistic decision-making and language evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper first proposes the Halfway Escape Optimization (HEO) algorithm, a novel quantum-inspired metaheuristic designed to address complex optimization problems characterized by rugged landscapes and high-dimensionality with an efficient convergence rate. The study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of HEO's performance against established optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The primary analysis encompasses 14 benchmark functions with dimension 30, demonstrating HEO's effectiveness and adaptability in navigating complex optimization landscapes and providing valuable insights into its performance. The simple test of HEO in Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) also infers its feasibility in real-time applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents sufficient conditions for the stability and $\ell_2$-gain performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with ReLU activation functions. These conditions are derived by combining Lyapunov/dissipativity theory with Quadratic Constraints (QCs) satisfied by repeated ReLUs. We write a general class of QCs for repeated RELUs using known properties for the scalar ReLU. Our stability and performance condition uses these QCs along with a "lifted" representation for the ReLU RNN. We show that the positive homogeneity property satisfied by a scalar ReLU does not expand the class of QCs for the repeated ReLU. We present examples to demonstrate the stability / performance condition and study the effect of the lifting horizon.</description>
