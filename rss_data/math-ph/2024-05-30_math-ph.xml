      <title>Spectral flow and Levinson's theorem for Schr\"o dinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use spectral flow to present a new proof of Levinson's theorem for Schr\"{o}dinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth compactly supported potential. Our proof is valid in all dimensions and in the presence of resonances. The statement is expressed in terms of the spectral shift function and the ``high energy corrected time delay'' following Guillop\'{e} and others.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for automorphisms of quantum systems on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of continuous automorphism groups of quantum spin systems on the lattice. Whereas the shift is norm asymptotically abelian continuous automorphism groups can lead only to delocalization but not to norm asymptotic abelianess. As a consequence the shift does not allow a continuous extension.</description>

      <title>Mixed radix numeration bases: H\"orner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known H\"orner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between non-commutative harmonic oscillators and two-photon quantum Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative harmonic oscillator on $L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ introduced by Parmeggiani and Wakayama is equivalent to the two-photon quantum Rabi model, and they are also equivalent to a holomorphic differential equation on the unit disk. The confluence process of this differential equation and the relation with the one-photon quantum Rabi model are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Proof of $\mathfrak{L}^2$-Boundedness for Magnetic Pseudodifferential Super Operators via Matrix Representations With Respect to Parseval Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental result in pseudodifferential theory is the Calder\'on-Vaillancourt theorem, which states that a pseudodifferential operator defined from a H\"ormander symbol of order $0$ defines a bounded operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. In this work we prove an analog for pseudodifferential \emph{super} operator, \ie operators acting on other operators, in the presence of magnetic fields. More precisely, we show that magnetic pseudodifferential super operators of order $0$ define bounded operators on the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators $\mathfrak{L}^2 \bigl ( \mathcal{B} \bigl ( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \bigr ) \bigr )$. Our proof is inspired by the recent work of Cornean, Helffer and Purice and rests on a characterization of magnetic pseudodifferential super operators in terms of their "matrix element" computed with respect to a Parseval frame.</description>

      <title>On Low-Rank Multiplicity-Free Fusion Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explains the methods and algorithms we used to obtain explicit F symbols, R symbols, and pivotal coefficients of all multiplicity-free pivotal fusion categories up to rank 7. The thesis starts by introducing the concept of a unitary modular fusion system via two applications: modeling anyons for topological quantum computation and calculating braid group representations. Next, the notions of a pivotal, spherical, braided, ribbon, and modular fusion system are introduced. Unitarity and its implications on the pivotal structure are discussed as well. The next part of the thesis is devoted to algorithms for finding fusion systems and compatible structures. First, an algorithm to find low-rank fusion rings is explained, and its results are given. Special attention is given to the structure of non-commutative fusion rings and the construction of songs, which are generalizations of the Tambara-Yamagami and Haagerup Izumi fusion rings, is given. Then, the algorithms used to find fusion systems are discussed. Particular attention is given to how the individual steps for solving the consistency equations are done with Anyonica, a software package we developed for working with fusion systems. Gauge and automorphism equivalence are reviewed, and algorithms that put solutions in a unitary gauge and remove redundant solutions are given. Some results on the categorification of all multiplicity-free pivotal fusion rings up to rank 7 are presented. The final part of the thesis is devoted to building models of anyons on graphs and how their behavior differs from those in the plane. The appendices contain a minimal mathematical exposition on fusion categories with their relation to fusion systems, a list of all multiplicity-free fusion rings up to rank 9 with information on categorifiability, a list of all multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7, and data on some graph-braid models.</description>

      <title>On the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for spin chains with simple $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for a closed, rational spin chain with $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry for any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Starting the nesting process by removing a single simple root from $\mathfrak{g}$, we use the residual $U(1)$ charge and the block Gauss decomposition of the $R$-matrix to derive many standard results in the Bethe ansatz, such as the nesting of Yangian algebras, and the AB commutation relation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of water waves of finite depth and flat bottom is studied in the case when the depth is not small in comparison to the wavelength. This propagation regime is complementary to the long-wave regime described by the famous KdV equation. The Hamiltonian approach is employed in the derivation of a model equation in evolutionary form, which is both nonlinear and nonlocal, and most likely not integrable. Possible implications for the numerical solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>A T-Duality of Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic Strings and an implication for Topological Modular Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments connecting non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory to the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF), we show that the worldsheet theory with central charge $(17,\frac{3}{2})$ obtained by fibering the $(E_8)_1 \times (E_8)_1$ current algebra over the $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ sigma model on $S^{1}$ with antiperiodic spin structure (such that the two $E_8$ factors are exchanged as we go around the circle), is continuously connected to the $(E_8)_2$ theory in the Gaiotto$-$Johnson-Freyd$-$Witten sense of going "up and down the RG trajectories". Combined with the work of Tachikawa and Yamashita, this furnishes a physical derivation of the fact that the $(E_8)_2$ theory corresponds to the unique nontrivial torsion element $[(E_8)_2]$ of $\mathsf{TMF}^{31}$ with zero mod-2 elliptic genus.</description>

      <title>On stability of k-local quantum phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current theoretical framework for topological phases of matter is based on the thermodynamic limit of a system with geometrically local interactions. A natural question is to what extent the notion of a phase of matter remains well-defined if we relax the constraint of geometric locality, and replace it with a weaker graph-theoretic notion of $k$-locality. As a step towards answering this question, we analyze the stability of the energy gap to perturbations for Hamiltonians corresponding to general quantum low-density parity-check codes, extending work of Bravyi and Hastings [Commun. Math. Phys. 307, 609 (2011)]. A corollary of our main result is that if there exist constants $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2&gt;0$ such that the size $\Gamma(r)$ of balls of radius $r$ on the interaction graph satisfy $\Gamma(r) = O(\exp(r^{1-\varepsilon_1}))$ and the local ground states of balls of radius $r\le\rho^\ast = O(\log(n)^{1+\varepsilon_2})$ are locally indistinguishable, then the energy gap of the associated Hamiltonian is stable against local perturbations. This gives an almost exponential improvement over the $D$-dimensional Euclidean case, which requires $\Gamma(r) = O(r^D)$ and $\rho^\ast = O(n^\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. The approach we follow falls just short of proving stability of finite-rate qLDPC codes, which have $\varepsilon_1 = 0$; we discuss some strategies to extend the result to these cases. We discuss implications for the third law of thermodynamics, as $k$-local Hamiltonians can have extensive zero-temperature entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a quantitative version of the hydrodynamic limit for an interacting particle system inspired by integrate-and-fire neuron models. More precisely, we show that the $L^2$-speed of convergence of the empirical density of states in a generalized contact process defined over a $d$-dimensional torus of size $n$ is of the optimal order $\mathcal O(n^{d/2})$. In addition, we show that the typical fluctuations around the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit are Gaussian, and governed by a inhomogeneous stochastic linear equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a class of splitting schemes employing implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-stepping to achieve accurate and energy-stable solutions for thin-film equations and Cahn-Hilliard models with variable mobility. This splitting method incorporates a linear, constant coefficient implicit step, facilitating efficient computational implementation. We investigate the influence of stabilizing splitting parameters on the numerical solution computationally, considering various initial conditions. Furthermore, we generate energy-stability plots for the proposed methods, examining different choices of splitting parameter values and timestep sizes. These methods enhance the accuracy of the original bi-harmonic-modified (BHM) approach, while preserving its energy-decreasing property and achieving second-order accuracy. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Existence, Uniqueness and Asymptotic Dynamics of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations With Quasi-Periodic Initial Data: I. The Standard NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a two-paper series studying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with quasi-periodic initial data. In this paper, we consider the standard nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Under the assumption that the Fourier coefficients of the initial data obey a power-law upper bound, we establish local existence of a solution that retains quasi-periodicity in space with a slightly weaker Fourier decay. Moreover, the solution is shown to be unique within this class of quasi-periodic functions. In addition, for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with small nonlinearity, within the time scale, as the small parameter of nonlinearity tends to zero, we prove that the nonlinear solution converges asymptotically to the linear solution with respect to both the sup-norm $\|\cdot\|_{L_x^\infty(\mathbb R)}$ and the Sobolev-norm $\|\cdot\|_{H^s_x(\mathbb R)}$.
  The proof proceeds via a consideration of an associated infinite system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients and a combinatorial analysis of the resulting tree expansion of the coefficients. For this purpose, we introduce a Feynman diagram for the Picard iteration and $\ast^{[\cdot]}$ to denote the complex conjugate label.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty relations for overcomplete measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study aims to examine uncertainty relations for overcomplete measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames. Informationally overcomplete measurements are a valuable tool in quantum information processing, including tomography and state estimation. The maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases are the most common case of informationally overcomplete measurements. The existence of $d+1$ of mutually unbiased bases is proved for $d$ being a prime power. More general classes of informationally overcomplete measurements have been proposed for various purposes. Such measurements are typically characterized by some inner structure maintaining the required properties. It leads to restrictions imposed on generated probabilities. To apply the measurements of interest, these restrictions should be converted into information-theoretic terms. To describe the amount of uncertainty quantitatively, we use the Tsallis and R\'{e}nyi entropies as well as probabilities of separate outcomes. The obtained results are based on estimation of the index of coincidence. The derived relations are briefly exemplified.</description>

      <title>Yangian for cotangent Lie algebras and spectral $R$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a canonical quantization of Lie bialgebra structures on the formal power series $\mathfrak{d}[\![t]\!]$ with coefficients in the cotangent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d} = T^*\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g} \ltimes \mathfrak{g}^*$ to a simple complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that these quantizations produce twists to the natural analog of the Yangian for $\mathfrak{d}$. Moreover, we construct spectral $R$-matrices for these twisted Yangians as compositions of twisting matrices.
  The motivation for the construction of these twisted Yangians over $\mathfrak{d}$ comes from certain 4d holomorphic-topological gauge theory. More precisely, we show that pertubative line operators in this theory can be realized as representations of these Yangians. Moreover, the comultiplications of these Yangians correspond to the monodial structure of the category of line operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bigraded Toda hierarchy $L_1^M(n)=L_2^N(n)$ is generalized to $L_1^M(n)=L_2^{N}(n)+\sum_{j\in \mathbb Z}\sum_{i=1}^{m}q^{(i)}_n\Lambda^jr^{(i)}_{n+1}$, which is the analogue of the famous constrained KP hierarchy $L^{k}= (L^{k})_{\geq0}+\sum_{i=1}^{m}q_{i}\partial^{-1}r_i$. It is known that different bosonizations of fermionic KP hierarchy will give rise to different kinds of integrable hierarchies. Starting from the fermionic form of constrained KP hierarchy, bilinear equation of this generalized bigraded Toda hierarchy (GBTH) are derived by using 2--component boson--fermion correspondence. Next based upon this, the Lax structure of GBTH is obtained. Conversely, we also derive bilinear equation of GBTH from the corresponding Lax structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One way to uniquely define Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) in multiply connected domains is to use the restriction property. This gives an implicit definition of a $\sigma$-finite measure on curves; yet it is in general not clear how to construct such measures nor whether the mass of these measures, called the partition function, is finite.
  We provide an explicit construction of the such conformal restriction SLEs in multiply connected domains when $\kappa = 4$ using the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). In particular, both when the target points of the curve are on the same or on distinct boundary components, we show that there is a mixture of laws of level lines of GFFs that satisfies the restriction property. This allows us to give an expression for the partition function of $\mathrm{sle}_4$ on multiply connected domains and shows that the partition function is finite, answering the question raised in [Lawler, J. Stat. Phys. 2009].
  In a second part, we provide a second construction of $\mathrm{sle}_\kappa$ in multiply-connected domains for the whole range $\kappa \in (8/3,4]$; specific, however, to the case of the two target points belonging to the same boundary components. This is inspired by [Werner, Wu, Electron. J. Probab. 2013] and consists of a mixture of laws on curves obtained by following $\mathrm{cle}_\kappa$ loops and restriction hulls attached to parts of the boundary of the domain. In this case as well, we obtain as a corollary the finiteness of the partition function for this type of $\mathrm{sle}_\kappa$.</description>

      <title>High-order Van Hove singularities and their connection to flat bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flattening of single-particle band structures plays an important role in the quest for novel quantum states of matter due to the crucial role of interactions. Recent advances in theory and experiment made it possible to construct and tune systems with nearly flat bands, ranging from graphene multilayers and moire' materials to kagome' metals and ruthenates. While theoretical models predict exactly flat bands under certain ideal conditions, evidence was provided that these systems host high-order Van Hove points, i.e., points of high local band flatness and power-law divergence in energy of the density of states. In this review, we examine recent developments in engineering and realising such weakly dispersive bands. We focus on high-order Van Hove singularities and explore their connection to exactly flat bands. We provide classification schemes and discuss interaction effects. We also review experimental evidence for high-order Van Hove singularities and point out future research directions.</description>

      <title>Positivity and universal Pl\"ucker coordinates for spaces of quasi-exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-exponential is an entire function of the form $e^{cu}p(u)$, where $p(u)$ is a polynomial and $c \in \mathbb{C}$. Let $V = \langle e^{h_1u}p_1(u), \dots, e^{h_Nu}p_N(u) \rangle$ be a vector space with a basis of quasi-exponentials. We show that if $h_1, \dots, h_N$ are nonnegative and all of the complex zeros of the Wronskian $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$ are real, then $V$ is totally nonnegative in the sense that all of its Grassmann-Pl\"{u}cker coordinates defined by the Taylor expansion about $u=t$ are nonnegative, for any real $t$ greater than all of the zeros of $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$. Our proof proceeds by showing that the higher Gaudin Hamiltonians $T_\lambda^G(t)$ introduced in [ALTZ14] are universal Pl\"ucker coordinates about $u=t$ for the Wronski map on spaces of quasi-exponentials. The result that $V$ is totally nonnegative follows from the fact that $T_\lambda^G(t)$ is positive semidefinite, which we establish using partial traces. We also show that if $h_1 = \cdots = h_N = 0$ then $T_\lambda^G(t)$ equals $\beta^\lambda(t)$, which is the universal Pl\"ucker coordinate for the Wronski map on spaces of polynomials introduced in [KP23].</description>

Abstract: Lattice geometries and random walks on them are of great interest for their applications in different fields such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. In this work, we focus on multi-headed lattices and study properties of the Green functions for these lattices such as the associated differential equations and the P\'olya numbers. In particular, we complete the analysis of three missing cases in dimensions no larger than five. Our results are built upon an automatic machinery of creative telescoping.</description>

      <title>Non-compact quantum spin chains as integrable stochastic particle processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.01048v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a family of models of particle and energy diffusion on a one-dimensional lattice, related to those studied previously in [Sasamoto-Wadati], [Barraquand-Corwin] and [Povolotsky] in the context of KPZ universality class. We show that they may be mapped onto an integrable $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ Heisenberg spin chain whose Hamiltonian density in the bulk has been already studied in the AdS/CFT and the integrable system literature. Using the quantum inverse scattering method, we study various new aspects, in particular we identify boundary terms, modeling reservoirs in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics models, for which the spin chain (and thus also the stochastic process) continues to be integrable. We also show how the construction of a "dual model" of probability theory is possible and useful. The fluctuating hydrodynamics of our stochastic model corresponds to the semiclassical evolution of a string that derives from correlation functions of local gauge invariant operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM), in imaginary-time. As any stochastic system, it has a supersymmetric completion that encodes for the thermal equilibrium theorems: we show that in this case it is equivalent to the $\mathfrak{sl}(2|1)$ superstring that has been derived directly from $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary choice of two sets of nonzero Boltzmann weights for $n$-color lattice models, we provide explicit algebraic conditions on these Boltzmann weights which guarantee a solution (i.e., a third set of weights) to the Yang-Baxter equation. Furthermore we provide an explicit one-dimensional parametrization of all solutions in this case. These $n$-color lattice models are so named because their admissible vertices have adjacent edges labeled by one of $n$ colors with additional restrictions. The two-colored case specializes to the six-vertex model, in which case our results recover the familiar quadric condition of Baxter for solvability. The general $n$-color case includes important solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation like the evaluation modules for the quantum affine Lie algebra $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_n)$. Finally, we demonstrate the invariance of this class of solutions under natural transformations, including those associated with Drinfeld twisting.</description>

      <title>Local Statistics in Normal Matrix Models with Merging Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the normal matrix model, also known as the two-dimensional one-component plasma at a specific temperature, with merging singularity. As the number $n$ of particles tends to infinity we obtain the limiting local correlation kernel at the singularity, which is related to the parametrix of the Painlev\'e~II equation. The two main tools are Riemann-Hilbert problems and the generalized Christoffel-Darboux identity. The correlation kernel exhibits a novel anisotropic scaling behavior, where the corresponding spacing scale of particles is $n^{-1/3}$ in the direction of merging and $n^{-1/2}$ in the perpendicular direction. In the vicinity at different distances to the merging singularity we also observe Ginibre bulk and edge statistics, as well as the sine-kernel and the universality class corresponding to the elliptic ensemble in the weak non-Hermiticity regime for the local correlation function.</description>

      <title>Canonical Typicality For Other Ensembles Than Micro-Canonical</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize L\'evy's lemma, a concentration-of-measure result for the uniform probability distribution on high-dimensional spheres, to a much more general class of measures, so-called GAP measures. For any given density matrix $\rho$ on a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, GAP$(\rho)$ is the most spread out probability measure on the unit sphere of $\mathcal{H}$ that has density matrix $\rho$ and thus forms the natural generalization of the uniform distribution. We prove concentration-of-measure whenever the largest eigenvalue $\|\rho\|$ of $\rho$ is small. We use this fact to generalize and improve well-known and important typicality results of quantum statistical mechanics to GAP measures, namely canonical typicality and dynamical typicality. Canonical typicality is the statement that for ``most'' pure states $\psi$ of a given ensemble, the reduced density matrix of a sufficiently small subsystem is very close to a $\psi$-independent matrix. Dynamical typicality is the statement that for any observable and any unitary time-evolution, for ``most'' pure states $\psi$ from a given ensemble the (coarse-grained) Born distribution of that observable in the time-evolved state $\psi_t$ is very close to a $\psi$-independent distribution. So far, canonical typicality and dynamical typicality were known for the uniform distribution on finite-dimensional spheres, corresponding to the micro-canonical ensemble, and for rather special mean-value ensembles. Our result shows that these typicality results hold also for GAP$(\rho)$, provided the density matrix $\rho$ has small eigenvalues. Since certain GAP measures are quantum analogs of the canonical ensemble of classical mechanics, our results can also be regarded as a version of equivalence of ensembles.</description>

      <title>Statistics of local level spacings in single- and many-body quantum chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of local level spacings and study their statistics within a random-matrix-theory approach. In the limit of infinite-dimensional random matrices, we determine universal sequences of mean local spacings and of their ratios which uniquely identify the global symmetries of a quantum system and its internal -- chaotic or regular -- dynamics. These findings, which offer a new framework to monitor single- and many-body quantum systems, are corroborated by numerical experiments performed for zeros of the Riemann zeta function, spectra of irrational rectangular billiards and many-body spectra of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Non-unique Hamiltonians for Discrete Symplectic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An outstanding property of any Hamiltonian system is the symplecticity of its flow, namely, the continuous trajectory preserves volume in phase space. Given a symplectic but discrete trajectory generated by a transition matrix applied at a fixed time-increment ($\tau &gt; 0$), it was generally believed that there exists a unique Hamiltonian producing a continuous trajectory that coincides at all discrete times ($t = n\tau$ with $n$ integers) as long as $\tau$ is small enough. However, it is now exactly demonstrated that, for any given discrete symplectic dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, there exists an infinite number of real-valued Hamiltonians for any small value of $\tau$ and an infinite number of complex-valued Hamiltonians for any large value of $\tau$. In addition, when the transition matrix is similar to a Jordan normal form with the supradiagonal element of $1$ and the two identical diagonal elements of either $1$ or $-1$, only one solution to the Hamiltonian is found for the case with the diagonal elements of $1$, but no solution can be found for the other case.</description>

      <title>Weyl's law in Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can you hear the shape of Liouville quantum gravity? We obtain a Weyl law for the eigenvalues of Liouville Brownian motion: the $n$-th eigenvalue grows linearly with $n$, with the proportionality constant given by the Liouville area of the domain and a certain deterministic constant $c_\gamma$ depending on $\gamma \in (0, 2)$. The constant $c_\gamma$, initially a complicated function of Sheffield's quantum cone, can be evaluated explicitly and is strictly greater than the equivalent Riemannian constant.
  At the heart of the proof we obtain sharp asymptotics of independent interest for the small-time behaviour of the on-diagonal heat kernel. Interestingly, we show that the scaled heat kernel displays nontrivial pointwise fluctuations. Fortunately, at the level of the heat trace these pointwise fluctuations cancel each other, which leads to the result.
  We complement these results with a number of conjectures on the spectral geometry of Liouville quantum gravity, notably suggesting a connection with quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Strong cosmic censorship for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-charged-Klein-Gordon system with positive $\Lambda$: stability of the Cauchy horizon and $H^1$ extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of a dynamical black hole as described by the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-Klein-Gordon system of equations with a cosmological constant, under spherical symmetry. In particular, we consider a characteristic initial value problem where, on the outgoing initial hypersurface, interpreted as the event horizon $\mathcal{H}^+$ of a dynamical black hole, we prescribe: a) initial data asymptotically approaching a fixed sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solution; b) an exponential Price law upper bound for the charged scalar field. After showing local well-posedness for the corresponding first-order system of partial differential equations, we establish the existence of a Cauchy horizon $\mathcal{CH}^+$ for the evolved spacetime, extending the bootstrap methods used in the case $\Lambda = 0$ by Van de Moortel. In this context, we show the existence of $C^0$ spacetime extensions beyond $\mathcal{CH}^+$. Moreover, if the scalar field decays at a sufficiently fast rate along $\mathcal{H}^+$, we show that the renormalized Hawking mass remains bounded for a large set of initial data. With respect to the analogous model concerning an uncharged and massless scalar field, we are able to extend the known range of parameters for which mass inflation is prevented, up to the optimal threshold suggested by the linear analyses by Costa-Franzen and Hintz-Vasy. In this no-mass-inflation scenario, which includes near-extremal solutions, we further prove that the spacetime can be extended across the Cauchy horizon with continuous metric, Christoffel symbols in $L^2_{\text{loc}}$ and scalar field in $H^1_{\text{loc}}$. By generalizing the work by Costa-Gir\~ao-Nat\'ario-Silva to the case of a charged and massive scalar field, our results reveal a potential failure of the Christodoulou-Chru\'sciel version of the strong cosmic censorship under spherical symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a simple and elementary proof that meromorphic conformal field theories (CFTs) have central charges of the form: $c=8N$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}$ (the set of natural numbers) using the modular linear differential equations (MLDEs) approach. We first set up the 1-character MLDE for arbitrary value of the Wronskian index: $\ell$. From this we get the general form of the meromorphic CFT's character. We then study its modular transformations and the asymptotic value of it's Fourier coefficients -- using Rademacher series -- to conclude that odd values of $\ell$ make the character in-admissible implying that the central charge for admissible character has to be a multiple of 8.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we follow the framework given in the article {\it Physica A}, \textbf{158}, pg 58-63 (1989) by R. Laflamme to derive the thermofield double state for a causal diamond using the Euclidean path integral formalism, and subsequently derive the causal diamond temperature. The interpretation of the physical and fictitious system in the thermofield double state arises naturally from the boundary conditions of the fields defined on the Euclidean sections of the cylindrical background geometry $S^{1}_{\beta}\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\beta$ defines the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate and $S^{1}_{\beta}$ is a circumference of length $\beta$. The temperature detected by a static diamond observer at $x=0$ matches with the thermofield double temperature derived via this path integral procedure.</description>

      <title>Tight concentration inequalities for quantum adversarial setups exploiting permutation symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed new concentration inequalities for a quantum state on an $N$-qudit system or measurement outcomes on it that apply to an adversarial setup, where an adversary prepares the quantum state. Our one-sided concentration inequalities for a quantum state require the $N$-qudit system to be permutation invariant and are thus de-Finetti type, but they are tighter than the one previously obtained. We show that the bound can further be tightened if each qudit system has an additional symmetry. Furthermore, our concentration inequality for the outcomes of independent and identical measurements on an $N$-qudit quantum system has no assumption on the adversarial quantum state and is much tighter than the conventional one obtained through Azuma's inequality. We numerically demonstrate the tightness of our bounds in simple quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the stochastic Abelian-Higgs equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the stochastic Abelian-Higgs equations in two dimensions. The proof is based on a new covariant approach, which consists of two parts: First, we introduce covariant stochastic objects. The covariant stochastic objects and their multi-linear interactions are controlled using covariant heat kernel estimates. Second, we control nonlinear remainders using a covariant monotonicity formula, which is inspired by earlier work of Hamilton.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: exact analysis through theory of block Toeplitz determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are usually significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$ block) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. As a result, the constants $E(a)$ and $E(\tilde a)$ for the large $n$ asymptotics still allow explicit representations that generalize the strong Szeg\"o's theorem for scalar symbols. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, ``logarithmic divergences'' in the Wiener-Hopf factors generate certain ``anomalous terms'' in the exponential form factor expansions of the re-scaled correlators. Since our boundaries in the naive scaling limits can be formulated as certain integrable boundaries/defects in 2D massive QFTs, the results of this work facilitate detailed comparisons with bootstrap approaches.</description>

      <title>Existence of non-Abelian vortices in a coupled 4D-2D quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortices produce locally concentrated field configurations and are solutions to the nonlinear partial differential equations systems of complicated structures. In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness for solutions of the gauged non-Abelian vortices in a coupled 4D-2D quantum field theory by researching the nonlinear elliptic equations systems with exponential terms in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ using the calculus of variations. In addition, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the solutions at infinity and the quantized integrals in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.</description>
