      <title>Zeroes of Eigenfunctions of Schr\"odinger Operators after Schwartzman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a complete, connected, smooth, oriented Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with boundary, such that the first Betti number vanishes. Sol Schwartzman proved that for Schr\"odinger operators of the form $-\Delta_g + V$ where $\Im(V)$ is signed, if $f: M\to\mathbb{C}$ is a non-vanishing element of its kernel, then $f$ has constant phase. The proof relied on dynamical systems methods applied to the gradient flow of the phase of $f$. In this manuscript we provide a more direct PDE argument that proves strengthened versions of the same facts.</description>

      <title>Local uniqueness and non-degeneracy of blowup solutions for regular Liouville systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following Liouville system defined on a compact Riemann surface $M$, \begin{equation}
  -\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j e^{u_j}}-1\Big)\mbox{ in }M\mbox{ for }i=1,\cdots,n,\nonumber \end{equation} where the coefficient matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ is nonnegative, $h_1, \ldots, h_n$ are positive smooth functions, and $\rho_1, \ldots, \rho_n$ are positive constants. For the blowup solutions, we establish their uniqueness and non-degeneracy based on natural assumptions. The main results significantly generalize corresponding results for single Liouville equations \cite{BartJevLeeYang2019,BartYangZhang20241,BartYangZhang20242}. To overcome several substantial difficulties, we develop certain tools and extend them into a more general framework applicable to similar situations. Notably, to address the considerable challenge of a continuum of standard bubbles, we refine the techniques from Huang-Zhang \cite{HuangZhang2022} and Zhang \cite{Zhang2006,Zhang2009} to achieve extremely precise pointwise estimates. Additionally, to address the limited information provided by the Pohozaev identity, we develop a useful Fredholm theory to discern the exact role that the Pohozaev identity plays for systems. The considerable difference between systems and a single equation is also reflected in the location of blowup points, where the uncertainty of the energy type of the blowup point makes it difficult to determine the sufficiency of pointwise estimates. In this regard, we extend our highly precise pointwise estimates to any finite order. This aspect is drastically distinct from analyses of single equations.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak solutions to a structural acoustic model with a $C^1$ source term on the plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider a structural acoustic model consisting of a wave equation defined in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, strongly coupled with a Berger plate equation acting on the flat portion of the boundary of $\Omega$. The system is influenced by an arbitrary $C^1$ nonlinear source term in the plate equation. Using nonlinear semigroup theory and monotone operator theory, we establish the well-posedness of both local strong and weak solutions, along with conditions for global existence. With additional assumptions on the source term, we examine the Nehari manifold and establish the global existence of potential well solutions. Our primary objective is to characterize regimes in which the system remains globally well-posed despite arbitrary growth of the source term and the absence of damping mechanisms to stabilize the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of rate-independent elastoplastic spring network models with non-local random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time-evolution of elastoplastic materials reinforced by randomly distributed long-range interactions. Starting from a rate-independent system on a discrete spring lattice that combines local linearized elasticity, gradient-regularized plasticity and stochastic non-local links modeling stiff fibers, we establish a discrete-to-continuum limit in the energetic formulation. We prove that as the lattice spacing tends to zero, an evolutionary solution of the discrete system converges to the unique energetic solution of a continuum limit problem. The limiting continuum model couples classical elastoplasticity with a non-local energy featuring fractional-order interactions that capture the homogenized influence of random long-range reinforcements. These results extend previous static homogenization studies by rigorously treating path-dependent dissipation and showing existence, uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of the evolving solutions. The work therefore provides a mathematical foundation for simulating time-dependent mechanical response of fiber-reinforced composites with random architecture.</description>

      <title>Blow-up criteria for the semilinear parabolic equations driven by mixed local-nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to establish \emph{necessary and sufficient conditions} for the nonexistence of a global solution to the semilinear heat equation with a mixed local--nonlocal operator $ -\Delta + (-\Delta)^\sigma$, under a general time-dependent nonlinearity. Our results complement the recent work of Carhuas-Torre et al. [ArXiv, (2025), arXiv:2505.20401], in which the authors provide sufficient conditions for the existence and nonexistence of global solutions. In particular, our results recover the critical Fujita exponent for time-independent power-type nonlinearities, as obtained by Biagi et al. [Bull. London Math. Soc. (2024), 1--20] and Del Pezzo et al. [Nonlinear Anal. 255 (2025), 113761].</description>

      <title>From the Klein-Gordon Equation to the Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamic System: Local Well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Klein-Gordon equation, the quantum and relativistic parameters are intricately coupled, which complicates the direct consideration of quantum fluctuations. In this paper, the so-called Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamics System is derived from the Klein-Gordon equation with Poisson effects via the Madelung transformation, providing a fresh perspective for analyzing the singular limits, such as the semi-classical limits and non-relativistic limits. The Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamics System, when the semiclassical limit is taken, formally reduces to the Relativistic Hydrodynamics System. When the relativistic limit is taken, it formally reduces to the Quantum Hydrodynamics System. Additionally, we establish the local classical solutions for the Cauchy problem associated with the Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamic System. The initial density value is assumed to be a small perturbation of some constant state, but the other initial values do not require this restriction. The key point is that the Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamic System is reformulated as a hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system.</description>

      <title>The isoperimetric inequality for the capillary energy outside convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isoperimetric problem for capillary hypersurfaces with a general contact angle $\theta \in (0, \pi)$, outside arbitrary convex sets. We prove that the capillary energy of any surface supported on any such convex set is larger than that of a spherical cap with the same volume and the same contact angle on a flat support, and we characterize the equality cases. This provides a complete solution to the isoperimetric problem for capillary surfaces outside convex sets at arbitrary contact angles, generalizing the well-known Choe-Ghomi-Ritor\'e inequality, which corresponds to the case $\theta=\frac\pi2$.</description>

      <title>Subordinators and time-space fractional diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of solutions to a class of evolution equations arising from random-time changes driven by subordinators. Our focus is on fractional diffusion equations involving mixed local and nonlocal operators. By combining techniques from probability theory, asymptotic analysis, and partial differential equations (PDEs), we characterize the dynamics of the subordinated solutions. This approach extends classical fractional dynamics and establishes a deeper connection between stochastic processes and deterministic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior of a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlocal dynamic boundary condition and singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behavior of a nonlocal Cahn--Hilliard equation in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d=2,3)$, subject to a kinetic rate dependent nonlocal dynamic boundary condition. The kinetic rate $1/L$, with $L\in[0,+\infty)$, distinguishes different types of bulk-surface interactions. When $L\in[0,+\infty)$, for a general class of singular potentials including the physically relevant logarithmic potential, we establish the existence of a global attractor $\mathcal{A}_m^L$ in a suitable complete metric space. Moreover, we verify that the global attractor $\mathcal{A}_m^0$ is stable with respect to perturbations $\mathcal{A}_m^L$ for small $L&gt;0$. For the case $L\in(0,+\infty)$, based on the strict separation property of solutions, we prove the existence of exponential attractors through a short trajectory type technique, which also yields that the global attractor has finite fractal dimension. Finally, when $L\in(0,+\infty)$, by usage of a generalized {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality and an Alikakos-Moser type iteration, we show that every global weak solution converges to a single equilibrium in $\mathcal{L}^\infty$ as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Time Quasi-Periodic Three-dimensional Traveling Gravity Water Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with the pioneering computations of Stokes in 1847, the search of traveling waves in fluid mechanics has always been a fundamental topic, since they can be seen as building blocks to determine the long time dynamics (which is a widely open problem). In this paper we prove the existence of time quasi-periodic traveling wave solutions for three-dimensional pure gravity water waves in finite depth, on flat tori, with an arbitrary number of speeds of propagation. These solutions are global in time, they do not reduce to stationary solutions in any moving reference frame and they are approximately given by finite sums of Stokes waves traveling with rationally independent speeds of propagation. This is a very hard small divisors problem for Partial Differential Equations due to the fact that one deals with a dispersive quasi-linear PDE in higher dimension with a very complicated geometry of the resonances. Our result is the first KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) result for an autonomous, dispersive, quasi-linear PDE in dimension greater than one and it is the first example of global solutions, which do not reduce to steady ones in any moving reference frame, for 3D water waves equations on compact domains.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between solvability of the Dirichlet and Regularity problem under an $L^1$ Carleson condition on $\partial_t A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper half space. It is known that solvability of the Regularity problem in $\dot{W}^{1,p}$ implies solvability of the adjoint Dirichlet problem in $L^{p'}$. Previously, Shen (2007) established a partial reverse result. In our work, we show that if we assume an $L^1$-Carleson condition on only $|\partial_t A|$ the full reverse direction holds. As a result, we obtain equivalence between solvability of the Dirichlet problem $(D)^*_{p'}$ and the Regularity problem $(R)_p$ under this condition.
  As a further consequence, we can extend the class of operators for which the $L^p$ Regularity problem is solvable by operators satisfying the mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ condition. Additionally in the case of the upper half plane, this class includes operators satisfying this $L^1$-Carleson condition on $|\partial_t A|$.</description>

      <title>Proving symmetry of localized solutions and application to dihedral patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the framework developed previously to allow for rigorous proofs of existence of smooth, localized solutions in semi-linear partial differential equations possessing both space and non-space group symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on the Swift-Hohenberg model. In particular, for a given symmetry group $\mathcal{G}$, we construct a natural Hilbert space $H^l_{\mathcal{G}}$ containing only functions with $\mathcal{G}$-symmetry. In this space, products and differential operators are well-defined allowing for the study of autonomous semi-linear PDEs. Depending on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$, we derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse around an approximate solution, $u_0$. More specifically, combining a meticulous analysis and computer-assisted techniques, the Newton-Kantorovich approach is validated thanks to the computation of some explicit bounds. The strategy for constructing $u_0$, the approximate inverse, and the computation of these bounds will depend on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate the methodology on the 2D Swift-Hohenberg PDE by proving the existence of various dihedral localized patterns. The algorithmic details to perform the computer-assisted proofs can be found on Github.</description>

      <title>A study of ferronematic thin films including a stray field energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferronematic materials are colloidal suspensions of magnetic particles in liquid crystals. They are complex materials with potential applications in display technologies, sensors, microfluidics devices, etc. We consider a model for ferronematics in a 2D domain with a variational approach. The proposed free energy of the ferronematic system depends on the Landau-de Gennes (LdG) order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$ and the magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, and incorporates the complex interaction between the liquid crystal molecules and the magnetic particles in the presence of an external magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_{ext}$. The energy functional combines the Landau-de Gennes nematic energy density and energy densities from the theory of micromagnetics including (an approximation of) the stray field energy and energetic contributions from an external magnetic field. For the proposed ferronematic energy, we first prove the existence of an energy minimizer and then the uniqueness of the minimizer in certain parameter regimes. Secondly, we numerically compute stable ferronematic equilibria by solving the gradient flow equations associated with the proposed ferronematic energy. The numerical results show that the stray field influences the localization of the interior nematic defects and magnetic vortices.</description>

      <title>$H^\infty$-calculus for the Dirichlet Laplacian on angular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish boundedness of the $H^\infty$-calculus for the Dirichlet Laplacian on angular domains in $\R^2$ and corresponding wedges on $L^p$-spaces with mixed weights. The weights are based on both the distance to the boundary and the distance to the tip of the underlying domain. Our main motivation comes from the study of stochastic partial differential equations and associated degenerate deterministic parabolic equations on non-smooth domains. As a consequence of our analysis, we also obtain maximal $L^p$-regularity for the Poisson equation on angular domains in appropriate weighted Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Even Cone Spherical Metrics: Blow-Up at a Cone Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study families of spherical metrics on the flat torus $E_{\tau}$ $=$ $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda_{\tau}$ with blow-up behavior at prescribed conical singularities at $0$ and $\pm p$, where the cone angle at $0$ is $6\pi$, and at $\pm p$ is $4\pi$. We prove that the existence of such a necessarily unique, even family of spherical metrics is completely determined by the geometry of the torus: such a family exists if and only if\textbf{ }the Green function $G(z;\tau)$ admits a pair of nontrivial critical points $\pm a$. In this case, the cone point $p$ must equal $a$, and the corresponding monodromy data is $\left( 2r,2s\right) $, where $a=r+s\tau.$
  An explicit transformation relating this family to the one with a single conical singularity of angle $6\pi$ at the origin is established in Theorem 1.4. A rigidity result for rhombic tori is proved in Theorem 1.5.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Localization Method for Time-Fractional Integro-Differential Equations with Nonsmooth Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a localized numerical scheme with low regularity requirements for solving time-fractional integro-differential equations. First, a fully discrete numerical scheme is constructed. Specifically, for temporal discretization, we employ the contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized hyperbolic contours to approximate the nonlocal operators. For spatial discretization, the standard piecewise linear Galerkin finite element method (FEM) is used. We then provide a rigorous error analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy even for problems with nonsmooth/vanishing initial values or low-regularity solutions, featuring spectral accuracy in time and second-order convergence in space. Finally, a series of numerical experiments in both 1-D and 2-D validate the theoretical findings and confirm that the algorithm combines the advantages of spectral accuracy, low computational cost, and efficient memory usage.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dissipation and regularization in isotropic Gaussian turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of "turbulent" solutions to the stochastic transport and the stochastic continuity equations constructed by Le Jan and Raimond in [Ann. Probab. 30(2): 826-873, 2002]. The advecting velocity field, not necessarily incompressible, is Gaussian and white-in-time, space-homogeneous and isotropic, with $\alpha$-H\"older regularity in space, $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We cover the full range of compressibility ratios giving spontaneous stochasticity of particle trajectories. For the stochastic transport equation, we prove that generic $L^2_x$ data experience anomalous dissipation of the mean energy, and study basic properties of the resulting anomalous dissipation measure. Moreover, we show that starting from such irregular data, the solution immediately gains regularity and enters into a fractional Sobolev space $H^{1-\alpha-}_x$. The proof of the latter is obtained as a consequence of a new sharp regularity result for the degenerate parabolic PDE satisfied by the associated two-point self-correlation function, which is of independent interest. In the incompressible case, a Duchon-Robert-type formula for the anomalous dissipation measure is derived, making a precise connection between this self-regularizing effect and a limit on the flux of energy in the turbulent cascade. Finally, for the stochastic continuity equation, we prove that solutions starting from a Dirac delta initial condition undergo an average squared dispersion growing with respect to time as $t^{1/(1-\alpha)}$, rigorously establishing the analogue of Richardson's law of particle separations in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A qualitative study of the generalized dispersive systems with time-delay: The unbounded case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the time-delayed higher-order dispersive nonlinear differential equation \begin{equation*} u_t(x,t)+Au(x,t) +\lambda_0(x) u(x,t)+\lambda(x) u(x,t-\tau )=0 \end{equation*} where \begin{equation*} Au=(-1)^{j+1}\partial_x^{2j+1}u+(-1)^m\partial_x^{2m}u+ \frac{1}{p+1}\partial_xu^{p+1} \end{equation*} with $m\le j$ and $1\le p&lt;2j$. Under suitable assumptions on the time delay coefficients, we prove that the system is exponentially stable if the coefficient of the delay term is bounded from below by a suitable positive constant, without any assumption on the sign of the coefficient of the undelayed feedback. Additionally, in the absence of delay, general results of stabilization are established in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ for $s\in[0,2j+1]$. Our results generalize several previous theorems for the Korteweg-de Vries type delayed systems in the literature.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Schoen--Simon--Yau and Schoen--Simon theorems via iteration \`{a} la De Giorgi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof of the Schoen--Simon--Yau curvature estimates and associated Bernstein-type theorems (1975), and extend the original result by including the case of $6$-dimensional (stable minimal) immersions. The key step is an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^2$ norm of the second fundamental form.
  Further, we obtain a graph description, in the Lipschitz multi-valued sense, for any stable minimal immersion of dimension $n\geq 2$, that may have a singular set $\Sigma$ of locally finite $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}$-measure, and that is weakly close to a hyperplane. (In fact, if $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(\Sigma)=0$, the conclusion is strengthened to a union of smooth graphs.) This follows directly from an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^2$ tilt-excess (verified when the hypersurface is weakly close to a hyperplane). Specialising the multi-valued decomposition to the case of embeddings, we recover the Schoen--Simon theorem (1981).
  In both $\epsilon$-regularity theorems the relevant quantity (respectively, length of the second fundamental form and tilt function) solves a non-linear PDE on the immersed minimal hypersurface. The proof is carried out intrinsically (without linearising the PDE) by implementing an iteration method \`{a} la De Giorgi (from the linear De Giorgi--Nash--Moser theory). Stability implies estimates (intrinsic weak Caccioppoli inequalities) that make the iteration effective despite the non-linear framework. (In both $\epsilon$-regularity theorems the method gives explicit constants that quantify the required smallness.)</description>

      <title>Two-phase flows through porous media described by a Cahn--Hilliard--Brinkman model with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a new diffuse-interface model that describes creeping two-phase flows (i.e., flows exhibiting a low Reynolds number), especially flows that permeate a porous medium. The system of equations consists of a Brinkman equation for the volume averaged velocity field as well as a convective Cahn--Hilliard equation with dynamic boundary conditions for the phase-field, which describes the location of the two fluids within the domain. The dynamic boundary conditions are incorporated to model the interaction of the fluids with the wall of the container more precisely. In particular, they allow for a dynamic evolution of the contact angle between the interface separating the fluids and the boundary, and also for a convection-induced motion of the corresponding contact line. For our model, we first prove the existence of global-in-time weak solutions in the case where regular potentials are used in the Cahn--Hilliard subsystem. In this case, we can further show the uniqueness of the weak solution under suitable additional assumptions. Moreover, we further prove the existence of weak solutions in the case of singular potentials. Therefore, we regularize such singular potentials by a Yosida approximation, such that the results for regular potentials can be applied, and eventually pass to the limit in this approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Thermo-Elasticity Problems with Evolving Microstructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mathematical analysis and homogenization of a moving boundary problem posed for a highly heterogeneous, periodically perforated domain. More specifically, we are looking at a one-phase thermo-elasticity system with phase transformations where small inclusions, initially periodically distributed, are growing or shrinking based on a kinetic under-cooling-type law and where surface stresses are created based on the curvature of the phase interface. This growth is assumed to be uniform in each individual cell of the the perforated domain. After transforming to the initial reference configuration (utilizing the Hanzawa transformation), we use the contraction mapping principle to show the existence of a unique solution for a possibly small but $\varespilon$-independent time interval ($\varespilon$ is here the scale of heterogeneity). In the homogenization limit, we discover a macroscopic thermo-elasticity problem which is strongly non-linearly coupled (via an internal parameter called height function) to local changes in geometry. As a direct byproduct of the mathematical analysis work, we present an alternative equivalent formulation which lends itself to an effective precomputing strategy that is very much needed as the limit problem is computationally expensive.</description>

Abstract: We prove that twisting and filamentation occur near a family of stable steady states for one dimensional periodic Vlasov-Poisson system, describing the electron dynamics under a fixed ion background. More precisely, we establish the growth in time of the L1 norm of the gradient for the electron distribution function and the corresponding flow map in the phase space. To support this result, we prove existence results of stable steady states for a class of ion densities on the torus.</description>

      <title>Singular perturbations models in phase transitions for anisotropic higher-order materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a model for phase transitions in which a double-well potential is singularly perturbed by possibly several terms involving different, arbitrarily high orders of derivation. We study by $\Gamma$-convergence the asymptotic behaviour as $\varepsilon\to 0$ of the functionals \begin{equation*}
  F_\varepsilon(u):=\int_\Omega \Bigl[\frac{1}{\varepsilon}W(u)+\sum_{\ell=1}^{k}q_\ell\varepsilon^{2\ell-1}|\nabla^{(\ell)}u|_\ell^2\Bigr]\,dx, \qquad u\in H^k(\Omega), \end{equation*} for fixed $k&gt;1$ integer, addressing also to the case in which the coefficients $q_1,...,q_{k-1}$ are negative and $|\cdot|_\ell$ is any norm on the space of symmetric $\ell$-tensors for each $\ell\in\{1,...,k\}$. The negativity of the coefficients leads to the lack of a priori bounds on the functionals; such issue is overcome by proving a nonlinear interpolation inequality. With this inequality at our disposal, a compactness result is achieved by resorting to the recent paper [10]. A further difficulty is the presence of general tensor norms which carry anisotropies, making standard slicing arguments not suitable. We prove that the $\Gamma$-limit is finite only on sharp interfaces and that it equals an anisotropic perimeter, with a surface energy density described by a cell formula.</description>

      <title>Physical Space Proof of Bilinear Estimates and Applications to Nonlinear Dispersive Equations (II)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work by Kenig-Ponce-Vega [15] initiated the use of Bourgain spaces to study the low-regularity well-posedness of semilinear dispersive equations. Since then, the Bourgain space method has become the dominant, and almost the only method to deal with this problem. The goal of this series of papers is to propose an alternative approach for this problem that does not rely on Bourgain spaces. Our method is based on a bilinear estimate, which is proved in a physical space approach by a new div-curl type lemma introduced by the third author. Combining these ingredients with a Strichartz estimate of mixed spatial integrability, we will illustrate our method in the present paper by reproducing best known local well-posedness results for the 2d and 3d Zakharov system from Bejenaru-Herr-Holmer-Tataru [2] and Bejenaru-Herr [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $L^2$ to $L^p$ operator norms of spectral projectors for the Euclidean Laplacian on the torus in the case where the spectral window is narrow. With a window of constant size this is a classical result of Sogge; in the small-window limit we are left with $L^p$ norms of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, as considered for instance by Bourgain. For the three-dimensional torus we prove new cases of a previous conjecture of the first two authors concerning the size of these norms; we also refine certain prior results to remove $\epsilon$-losses in all dimensions. We use methods from number theory: the geometry of numbers, the circle method and exponential sum bounds due to Guo. We complement these techniques with height splitting and a bilinear argument to prove sharp results.
  We exposit on the various techniques used and their limitations.</description>

Abstract: We prove quantitative homogenization results for harmonic functions on supercritical continuum percolation clusters--that is, Poisson point clouds with edges connecting points which are closer than some fixed distance. We show that, on large scales, harmonic functions resemble harmonic functions in Euclidean space with sharp quantitative bounds on their difference. In particular, for every point cloud which is supercritical (meaning that the intensity of the Poisson process is larger than the critical parameter which guarantees the existence of an infinite connected component), we obtain optimal corrector bounds, homogenization error estimates and large-scale regularity results.</description>

      <title>Surprising symmetry properties and exact solutions of Kolmogorov backward equations with power diffusivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the original advanced version of the direct method, we efficiently compute the equivalence groupoids and equivalence groups of two peculiar classes of Kolmogorov backward equations with power diffusivity and solve the problems of their complete group classifications. The results on the equivalence groups are double-checked with the algebraic method. Within these classes, the remarkable Fokker-Planck and the fine Kolmogorov backward equations are distinguished by their exceptional symmetry properties. We extend the known results on these two equations to their counterparts with respect to a nontrivial discrete equivalence transformation. Additionally, we carry out Lie reductions of the equations under consideration up to the point equivalence, exhaustively study their hidden Lie symmetries and generate wider families of their new exact solutions via acting by their recursion operators on constructed Lie-invariant solutions. This analysis reveals eight powers of the space variable with exponents -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as values of the diffusion coefficient that are prominent due to symmetry properties of the corresponding equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coven and Meyerowitz formulated two conditions which have since been conjectured to characterize all finite sets that tile the integers by translation. By periodicity, this conjecture is reduced to sets which tile a finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_M$. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of this problem, where we replace sets with nonnegative functions $f,g$, such that $f(0)=g(0)=1$, $f\ast g=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Z}_M}$ is a functional tiling, and $f, g$ satisfy certain further natural properties associated with tilings. We show that the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions do not necessarily hold in such generality. Such examples of functional tilings carry the potential to lead to proper tiling counterexamples to the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for bounded domains in $\mathbb C^n$ with $\mathcal C^{1,1}$ smooth boundary, if there is a closed set $F$ of $2n-1$-Lebesgue measure $0$ such that $\partial \Omega \setminus F$ is $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth and locally pseudoconvex at every point, then $\Omega$ is globally pseudoconvex. Unlike in the globally $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth case, the condition ``$F$ of (relative) empty interior'' is not enough to obtain such a result. We also give some results under peak-set type hypotheses, which in particular provide a new proof of an old result of Grauert and Remmert about removable sets for pseudoconvexity under minimal hypotheses of boundary regularity.</description>

Abstract: We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected, bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a &gt; 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of when $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). Furthermore, we obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing weighted quadrature domains from their respective quadrature functions. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.</description>
