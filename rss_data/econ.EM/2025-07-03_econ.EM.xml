      <title>rdhte: Conditional Average Treatment Effects in RD Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneous treatment effects based on pretreatment covariates is a crucial aspect of empirical work. Building on Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell, Palomba, and Titiunik (2025), this article discusses the software package rdhte for estimation and inference of heterogeneous treatment effects in sharp regression discontinuity (RD) designs. The package includes three main commands: rdhte conducts estimation and robust bias-corrected inference for heterogeneous RD treatment effects, for a given choice of the bandwidth parameter; rdbwhte implements automatic bandwidth selection methods; and rdhte lincom computes point estimates and robust bias-corrected confidence intervals for linear combinations, a post-estimation command specifically tailored to rdhte. We also provide an overview of heterogeneous effects for sharp RD designs, give basic details on the methodology, and illustrate using an empirical application. Finally, we discuss how the package rdhte complements, and in specific cases recovers, the canonical RD package rdrobust (Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell, and Titiunik 2017).</description>

      <title>Uniform Validity of the Subset Anderson-Rubin Test under Heteroskedasticity and Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson-Rubin (AR) statistic for a general set of nonlinear moment restrictions. The statistic is based on the criterion function of the continuous updating estimator (CUE) for a subset of parameters not constrained under the Null. We treat the data distribution nonparametrically with parametric moment restrictions imposed under the Null. We show that subset tests and confidence intervals based on the AR statistic are uniformly valid over a wide range of distributions that include moment restrictions with general forms of heteroskedasticity. We show that the AR based tests have correct asymptotic size when parameters are unidentified, partially identified, weakly or strongly identified. We obtain these results by constructing an upper bound that is using a novel perturbation and regularization approach applied to the first order conditions of the CUE. Our theory applies to both cross-sections and time series data and does not assume stationarity in time series settings or homogeneity in cross-sectional settings.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage-Based Regressions with Many Related Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When using observational causal models, practitioners often want to disentangle the effects of many related, partially-overlapping treatments. Examples include estimating treatment effects of different marketing touchpoints, ordering different types of products, or signing up for different services. Common approaches that estimate separate treatment coefficients are too noisy for practical decision-making. We propose a computationally light model that uses a customized ridge regression to move between a heterogeneous and a homogenous model: it substantially reduces MSE for the effects of each individual sub-treatment while allowing us to easily reconstruct the effects of an aggregated treatment. We demonstrate the properties of this estimator in theory and simulation, and illustrate how it has unlocked targeted decision-making at Wayfair.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity Analysis with Heterogeneous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of effect heterogeneity at the group level is standard practice in empirical treatment evaluation research. However, treatments analyzed are often aggregates of multiple underlying treatments which are themselves heterogeneous, e.g. different modules of a training program or varying exposures. In these settings, conventional approaches such as comparing (adjusted) differences-in-means across groups can produce misleading conclusions when underlying treatment propensities differ systematically between groups. This paper develops a novel decomposition framework that disentangles contributions of effect heterogeneity and qualitatively distinct components of treatment heterogeneity to observed group-level differences. We propose semiparametric debiased machine learning estimators that are robust to complex treatments and limited overlap. We revisit a widely documented gender gap in training returns of an active labor market policy. The decomposition reveals that it is almost entirely driven by women being treated differently than men and not by heterogeneous returns from identical treatments. In particular, women are disproportionately targeted towards vocational training tracks with lower unconditional returns.</description>

      <title>Covariance Matrix Estimation for Positively Correlated Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comovement phenomenon in financial markets creates decision scenarios with positively correlated asset returns. This paper addresses covariance matrix estimation under such conditions, motivated by observations of significant positive correlations in factor-sorted portfolio monthly returns. We demonstrate that fine-tuning eigenvectors linked to weak factors within rotation-equivariant frameworks produces well-conditioned covariance matrix estimates. Our Eigenvector Rotation Shrinkage Estimator (ERSE) pairwise rotates eigenvectors while preserving orthogonality, equivalent to performing multiple linear shrinkage on two distinct eigenvalues. Empirical results on factor-sorted portfolios from the Ken French data library demonstrate that ERSE outperforms existing rotation-equivariant estimators in reducing out-of-sample portfolio variance, achieving average risk reductions of 10.52\% versus linear shrinkage methods and 12.46\% versus nonlinear shrinkage methods. Further checks indicate that ERSE yields covariance matrices with lower condition numbers, produces more concentrated and stable portfolio weights, and provides consistent improvements across different subperiods and estimation windows.</description>

      <title>Meta-emulation: An application to the social cost of carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large database of published model results is used to estimate the distribution of the social cost of carbon as a function of the underlying assumptions. The literature on the social cost of carbon deviates in its assumptions from the literatures on the impacts of climate change, discounting, and risk aversion. The proposed meta-emulator corrects this. The social cost of carbon is higher than reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Uniform Inference on High-dimensional Spatial Panel Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.07424v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose employing a high-dimensional generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator, regularized for dimension reduction and subsequently debiased to correct for shrinkage bias (referred to as a debiased-regularized estimator), for inference on large-scale spatial panel networks. In particular, the network structure, which incorporates a flexible sparse deviation that can be regarded either as a latent component or as a misspecification of a predetermined adjacency matrix, is estimated using a debiased machine learning approach. The theoretical analysis establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator, taking into account general temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in the data-generating processes. A primary contribution of our study is the development of a uniform inference theory, which enables hypothesis testing on the parameters of interest, including zero or non-zero elements in the network structure. Additionally, the asymptotic properties of the estimator are derived for both linear and nonlinear moments. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach. Finally, we apply our methodology to investigate the spatial network effects of stock returns.</description>

      <title>Robust Inference when Nuisance Parameters may be Partially Identified with Applications to Synthetic Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When conducting inference for the average treatment effect on the treated with a Synthetic Control Estimator, the vector of control weights is a nuisance parameter which is often constrained, high-dimensional, and may be only partially identified even when the average treatment effect on the treated is point-identified. All three of these features of a nuisance parameter can lead to failure of asymptotic normality for the estimate of the parameter of interest when using standard methods. I provide a new method yielding asymptotic normality for an estimate of the parameter of interest, even when all three of these complications are present. This is accomplished by first estimating the nuisance parameter using a regularization penalty to achieve a form of identification, and then estimating the parameter of interest using moment conditions that have been orthogonalized with respect to the nuisance parameter. I present high-level sufficient conditions for the estimator and verify these conditions in an example involving Synthetic Controls.</description>
