      <title>AlphaForge: A Framework to Mine and Dynamically Combine Formulaic Alpha Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability and low signal-to-noise ratio in financial data, combined with the necessity for interpretability, make the alpha factor mining workflow a crucial component of quantitative investment. Transitioning from early manual extraction to genetic programming, the most advanced approach in this domain currently employs reinforcement learning to mine a set of combination factors with fixed weights. However, the performance of resultant alpha factors exhibits inconsistency, and the inflexibility of fixed factor weights proves insufficient in adapting to the dynamic nature of financial markets. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage formulaic alpha generating framework AlphaForge, for alpha factor mining and factor combination. This framework employs a generative-predictive neural network to generate factors, leveraging the robust spatial exploration capabilities inherent in deep learning while concurrently preserving diversity. The combination model within the framework incorporates the temporal performance of factors for selection and dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to each component alpha factor. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms contemporary benchmarks in formulaic alpha factor mining. Furthermore, our model exhibits a notable enhancement in portfolio returns within the realm of quantitative investment.</description>

      <title>New intelligent empowerment for digital transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an innovative evaluation method based on large language models (LLMs) specifically designed to measure the digital transformation (DT) process of enterprises. By analyzing the annual reports of 4407 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq from 2005 to 2022, a comprehensive set of DT indicators was constructed. The findings revealed that DT significantly improves a company's financial performance, however, different digital technologies exhibit varying effects on financial performance. Specifically, blockchain technology has a relatively limited positive impact on financial performance. In addition, this study further discovered that DT can promote the growth of financial performance by enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs. This study provides a novel DT evaluation tool for the academic community, while also expanding the application scope of generative artificial intelligence technology in economic research.</description>

      <title>$\text{Alpha}^2$: Discovering Logical Formulaic Alphas using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alphas are pivotal in providing signals for quantitative trading. The industry highly values the discovery of formulaic alphas for their interpretability and ease of analysis, compared with the expressive yet overfitting-prone black-box alphas. In this work, we focus on discovering formulaic alphas. Prior studies on automatically generating a collection of formulaic alphas were mostly based on genetic programming (GP), which is known to suffer from the problems of being sensitive to the initial population, converting to local optima, and slow computation speed. Recent efforts employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for alpha discovery have not fully addressed key practical considerations such as alpha correlations and validity, which are crucial for their effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel framework for alpha discovery using DRL by formulating the alpha discovery process as program construction. Our agent, $\text{Alpha}^2$, assembles an alpha program optimized for an evaluation metric. A search algorithm guided by DRL navigates through the search space based on value estimates for potential alpha outcomes. The evaluation metric encourages both the performance and the diversity of alphas for a better final trading strategy. Our formulation of searching alphas also brings the advantage of pre-calculation dimensional analysis, ensuring the logical soundness of alphas, and pruning the vast search space to a large extent. Empirical experiments on real-world stock markets demonstrates $\text{Alpha}^2$'s capability to identify a diverse set of logical and effective alphas, which significantly improves the performance of the final trading strategy. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/x35f/alpha2.</description>
