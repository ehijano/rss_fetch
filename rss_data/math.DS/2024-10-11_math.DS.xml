      <title>Non-commutative skew-product extension dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a uniquely ergodic action of a locally compact group $G$ on a compact space $X_0$, we consider non-commutative skew-product extensions of the dynamics, on the crossed product $C(X_0)\rtimes_\alpha\mathbb{Z}$, through a $1$-cocycle of $G$ in $\mathbb{T}$, with $\alpha$ commuting with the given dynamics. We first prove that any such two skew-product extensions are conjugate if and only if the corresponding cocycles are cohomologous. We then study unique ergodicity and unique ergodicity w.r.t. the fixed-point subalgebra by characterizing both in terms of the cocycle assigning the dynamics. The set of all invariant states is also determined: it is affinely homeomorphic with $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{T})$, the Borel probability measures on the one-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}$, as long as the system is not uniquely ergodic. Finally, we show that unique ergodicity w.r.t. the fixed-point subalgebra of a skew-product extension amounts to the uniqueness of an invariant conditional expectation onto the fixed-point subalgebra</description>

      <title>Measures of intermediate pressures for geometric Lorenz attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure measures the complexity of a dynamical system concerning a continuous observation function. A dynamical system is called to admit the intermediate pressure property if for any observation function, the measure theoretical pressures of all ergodic measures form an interval. We prove that the intermediate pressure property holds for $C^r (r\geq 2)$ generic geometric Lorenz attractors while it fails for $C^r (r\geq 2)$ dense geometric Lorenz attractors, which gives a sharp contrast. Similar results hold for $C^1$ singular hyperbolic attractors.</description>

      <title>A Maximum Modulus Theorem for functions admitting Stokes phenomena, and specific cases of Dulac's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large classes of real-valued analytic functions that naturally emerge in the understanding of Dulac's problem, which addresses the finiteness of limit cycles in planar differential equations. Building on a Maximum Modulus-type result we got, our main statement essentially follows. Namely, for any function belonging to these classes, the following dichotomy holds: either it has isolated zeros or it coincides with the identity. As an application, we prove that the non-accumulation of limit cycles holds around a specific class of the so-called superreal polycycles.</description>

      <title>On difference Riccati equation and continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a difference Riccati equation $\Phi(x) + \rho(x)/\Phi(x-\omega) = v(x)$ with $1-$periodic continuos coefficients. Using continued fraction theory we investigate a problem of existence of continuos solutions for this equation. It is shown that convergence of a continued fraction representing a solution of the Riccati equation can be expressed in terms of hyperbolicity of a cocycle naturally associated to this continued fraction. We apply the critical set method to establish the uniform hyperbolicity of the cocycle and to obtain sufficient conditions for the convergence of a continued fraction giving a representation for a solution of the Riccati equation.</description>

      <title>Stability criteria for rough systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantitative direct method of proving the local stability for the trivial solution of a rough differential equation and of its regular discretization scheme. Using Doss-Sussmann technique and stopping time analysis, we prove that the trivial solution of the rough system is exponentially stable as long as the noise is small. The same conclusions hold for the regular discretization scheme with small noise and small step size. Our results are significantly stronger than \cite[Theorem 14]{garrido-atienzaetal} and \cite[Theorem 18]{GABSch18} and can be applied to non-flat bounded or linear noises.</description>

      <title>Nonwandering sets and the entropy of local homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A local homeomorphism between open subsets of a locally compact Hausdorff space induces dynamical systems with a wide range of applications, including in C*-algebras. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of nonwandering and wandering sets for such systems and show that, under mild conditions, the metric entropy is concentrated in the nonwandering set. More generally, we demonstrate that the entropy of the system is the maximum of the entropies of the systems restricted to the nonwandering set and the closure of the wandering set. We illustrate these results with several examples, including applications to subshifts over countable alphabets.</description>

      <title>Improved Gevrey-1 estimates of formal series expansions of center manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the coefficients $\phi_n$ of the formal series expansions $y=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \phi_n x^n\in x\mathbb C[[x]]$ of center manifolds of planar analytic saddle-nodes grow like $\Gamma(n+a)$ (after rescaling $x$) as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Here the quantity $a$ is the formal analytic invariant associated with the saddle node (following the work of J. Martinet and J.-P. Ramis). This growth property of $\phi_n$, which cannot be improved when the center manifold is nonanalytic, was recently (2024) described for a restricted class of nonlinearities by the present author in collaboration with P. Szmolyan. This joint work was in turn inspired by the work of Merle, Rapha\"{e}l, Rodnianski, and Szeftel (2022), which described the growth of the coefficients for a system related to self-similar solutions of the compressible Euler. In the present paper, we combine the previous approaches with a Borel-Laplace approach. Specifically, we adapt the Banach norm of Bonckaert and De Maesschalck (2008) in order to capture the singularity in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>A Complete Invariant for Flow Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal flow spaces of dimension 1 are among the most fundamental limit sets in dynamical systems. Here we establish a complete invariant for the flow equivalence of such objects. The invariant takes values in a category of `positive trope' equivalence classes of inverse sequences of free groups and positive maps, or alternatively within a certain category of symbolic systems. Moreover, every such symbolic system is realised by a flow space, and we thus have a one to one correspondence between flow equivalence classes of minimal flow spaces and positive trope classes of such systems. At the same time, this provides a complete invariant both for flow equivalence of minimal Z-Cantor dynamical systems and for what we call the germinal equivalence of minimal Z-Cantor dynamical systems. Our work thus greatly extends that of Barge and Diamond on their complete invariant of primitive substitution tilings, and provides counterpoint to the work of Giordano, Putnam and Skau on orbit equivalence of Z-Cantor systems.</description>

      <title>The cohomological equation and cyclic cocycles for renormalizable minimal Cantor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For typical properly ordered and minimal Bratteli diagrams $(B,\leq_r)$, it is shown that there are finitely many invariant distributions $\mathcal{D}_i$ which are the only obstructions to solving the cohomological equation $f = u-u\circ \phi$ for the corresponding adic transformation $\phi:X_B\rightarrow X_B$ and for $\alpha$-H\"older $f$ with $\alpha$ large enough. These invariant distributions are then used to define cyclic cocycles, a.k.a. traces $\tau:K_0(\mathcal{A}_\phi)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ for the crossed product algebra $\mathcal{A}_\phi$.</description>

      <title>How Social Network Structure Impacts the Ability of Zealots to Promote Weak Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social networks are often permeated by agents who promote their opinions without allowing for their own mind to be changed: Understanding how these so-called `zealots' act to increase the prevalence of their promoted opinion over the network is important for understanding opinion dynamics. In this work, we consider these promoted opinions to be `weak' and therefore less likely to be accepted relative to the default opinion in the network. We show how the proportion of zealots in the network, the relative strength of the weak opinion, and the structure of the network impact the long-term proportion of the those in the network who subscribe to the weak opinion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a recursive subhomogeneous decomposition for the Cuntz--Pimsner algebras obtained from breaking the orbit of a minimal Hilbert $C(X)$-bimodule at a subset $Y \subset X$ with non-empty interior. This generalizes the known recursive subhomogeneous decomposition for orbit-breaking subalgebras of crossed products by minimal homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Neumann domains of planar analytic eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Along with the partition of a planar bounded domain $\Omega$ by the nodal set of a fixed eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in $\Omega$, one can consider another natural partition of $\Omega$ by, roughly speaking, gradient flow lines of a special type (separatrices) of this eigenfunction. Elements of such partition are called Neumann domains and their boundaries are Neumann lines. When the eigenfunction is a Morse function, this partition corresponds to the Morse--Smale complex and its fundamental properties have been systematically investigated by Band &amp; Fajman (2016). Although, in the case of general position, eigenfunctions are always of the Morse type, particular eigenfunctions can possess degenerate critical points. In the present work, we propose a way to characterize Neumann domains and lines of an arbitrary eigenfunction. Instead of requiring the nondegeneracy of critical points of the eigenfunction, its real analyticity is principally used. The analyticity allows for the presence of degenerate critical points but significantly limits their possible diversity. Even so, the eigenfunction can possess curves of critical points, which have to belong naturally to the Neumann lines set, as well as critical points of a saddle-node type. We overview all possible types of degenerate critical points in the eigenfunction's critical set and provide a numerically based evidence that each of them can be observed for particular eigenfunctions. Alongside with [Band &amp; Fajman, 2016], our approach is inspired by a little-known note of Weinberger that appeared back in 1963, where a part of the Neumann line set, under the name of "effectless cut", was explicitly introduced and studied for the first eigenfunctions in domains with nontrivial topology. In addition, we provide an asymptotic counting of Neumann domains for a disk and rectangles in analogy with the Pleijel constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became evident that the effectiveness of applying intervention measures is significantly influenced by societal acceptance, which, in turn, is affected by the processes of opinion formation. This article explores one among the many possibilities of a coupled opinion-epidemic system. The findings reveal either intricate periodic patterns or chaotic dynamics, leading to substantial fluctuations in opinion distribution and, consequently, significant variations in the total number of infections over time. Interestingly, the model is exhibiting the protective pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since simple semitoric systems were classified about fifteen years ago, and semitoric systems five years ago, we want to move a step forward to almost-toric systems. We give a classification of compact almost-toric systems in dimension four up to fiber-preserving symplectomorphisms, in terms of the base, Taylor series, and twisting indices, analogous to the five invariants for semitoric systems. For convenience, we specify an ordering of focus-focus values and a choice of two cut rays at each of them.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>

      <title>A [Chern] character defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cohomology rings of tiling spaces $\Omega$ given by cubical substitutions. While there have been many calculations before of cohomology groups of such tiling spaces, the innovation here is that we use computer-assisted methods to compute the cup-product structure. This leads to examples of substitution tilings with isomorphic cohomology groups but different cohomology rings. Part of the interest in studying the cup product comes from Bellissard's gap-labeling conjecture, which is known to hold in dimensions $\le 3$, but where a proof is known in dimensions $\ge 4$ only when the Chern character from $K^0(\Omega)$ to $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Q})$ lands in $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Z})$. Computation of the cup product on cohomology often makes it possible to compute the Chern character. We introduce a natural generalization of the gap-labeling conjecture, called the equivariant gap-labeling conjecture, which applies to tilings with a finite symmetry group. Again this holds in dimensions $\le 3$, but we are able to show that it fails in general in dimensions $\ge 4$. This, plus some of our cup product calculations, makes it plausible that the gap-labeling conjecture might fail in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Practical identification approach for the actuation dynamics of autonomous surface vehicles with minimal instrumentation: extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A practical method for identifying the propeller model and inertia matrix of a marine Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) is proposed in this work. Special attention is paid to limiting the instrumentation requirements. Based on a generic grey-box dynamic modelling addressing the considered catamaran-shaped ASV architecture, the static/dynamic behaviour of both propellers and the vessel dynamic are jointly estimated using the sole measurements of position, heading, and propellers pulse width modulation (PWM) signals. No accelerometer is required. Two distinct grey-box configurations involving either a static polynomial or a dynamic modelling of each propeller are proposed and compared. The resulting ASV identification methodology is shown to provide insight into the whole vessel inertial characteristics, which are key enablers in the development of autonomous navigation and control systems. Model validation was performed using data collected from the reported experiments. Model prediction errors related to both linear velocities and yaw rate are evaluated and compared based on given metrics. The results underscore the robustness and accuracy of the identified models in capturing the essential dynamics of the ASV, with a determination coefficient that consistently exceeds 0.94 for all estimated velocities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.02013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct, for every $d \geq 3$, a $d$-regular acyclic measurably bipartite graphing that admits no measurable perfect matching, resolving a problem of Kechris and Marks.
  A dense variant of our construction yields a coupling of two standard Borel probability measure spaces whose support contains no deterministic coupling, though the conditional probabilities of the coupling measure are atomless. This refutes a conjecture of Gurel-Gurevich and Peled.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Gravitational Collapse for Non-Isentropic Gaseous Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of a new class of initially smooth spherically symmetric self-similar solutions to the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system. These solutions exhibit supersonic gravitational implosion in the sense that the density blows-up in finite time while the fluid velocity remains supersonic. In particular, they occupy a portion of the phase space that is far from the recently constructed isentropic self-similar implosion. At the heart of our proof is the presence of a two-parameter scaling invariance and the reduction of the problem to a non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. We use the requirement of smoothness of the flow as a selection principle that constrains the choice of scaling indices. An important consequence of our analysis is that for all the solutions we construct, the polytropic index $\gamma$ is strictly bigger than $\frac{4}{3}$, which is in sharp contrast to the known results in the isentropic case.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Manifold Neural ODEs and Differential Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a manifestly geometric framework for equivariant manifold neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and use it to analyse their modelling capabilities for symmetric data. First, we consider the action of a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$ and establish the equivalence between equivariance of vector fields, symmetries of the corresponding Cauchy problems, and equivariance of the associated NODEs. We also propose a novel formulation, based on Lie theory for symmetries of differential equations, of the equivariant manifold NODEs in terms of the differential invariants of the action of $G$ on $M$, which provides an efficient parameterisation of the space of equivariant vector fields in a way that is agnostic to both the manifold $M$ and the symmetry group $G$. Second, we construct augmented manifold NODEs, through embeddings into flows on the tangent bundle $TM$, and show that they are universal approximators of diffeomorphisms on any connected $M$. Furthermore, we show that universality persists in the equivariant case and that the augmented equivariant manifold NODEs can be incorporated into the geometric framework using higher-order differential invariants. Finally, we consider the induced action of $G$ on different fields on $M$ and show how it can be used to generalise previous work, on, e.g., continuous normalizing flows, to equivariant models in any geometry.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of network dynamics from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of time series from dynamical networks that are partially observed. In particular, we address the extent to which the time series at a node of the network can be successfully reconstructed when measuring from another node, or subset of nodes, corrupted by observational noise. We will assume the dynamical equations of the network are known, and that the dynamics are not necessarily low-dimensional. The case of linear dynamics is treated first, and leads to a definition of observation error magnification factor (OEMF) that measures the magnification of noise in the reconstruction process. Subsequently, the definition is applied to nonlinear and chaotic dynamics. Comparison of OEMF for different target/observer combinations can lead to better understanding of how to optimally observe a network. As part of the study, a computational method for reconstructing time series from partial observations is presented and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of unstable blowup in a quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the work Cho et al. [Jpn. J. Ind. Appl. Math. 33 (2016): 145-166] the authors conjecture that the quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) $i u_t = u_{xx} + u^2 $ for $ x \in \mathbb{T}$ is globally well-posed for real initial data. We identify initial data whose numerical solution blows up in contradiction of this conjecture. The solution exhibits self-similar blowup and potentially nontrivial self-similar dynamics, however the proper scaling ansatz remains elusive.
  Furthermore, the set of real initial data which blows up under the NLS dynamics appears to occur on a codimension-1 manifold, and we conjecture that it is precisely the stable manifold of the zero equilibrium for the nonlinear heat equation $u_t = u_{xx} + u^2 $. We apply the parameterization method to study the internal dynamics of this manifold, offering a heuristic argument in support of our conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the existence of centered co-circular central configurations in the general power-law potential n-body problem. We prove the nonexistence of such configurations when the system consists of n-3 equal masses and three arbitrary masses, under the condition that the three special masses are distinct or, if two of them are equal, not arranged in a specific manner.</description>

      <title>Smoothing countable group actions on metrizable spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every topological action of a countable group on a metrizable space can be realized as a bi-Lipschitz action with respect to some compatible metric. This extends a result due to U. Hamenst\"{a}dt regarding finitely generated groups, and our proof is based upon her idea. This also gives a simple proof of a theorem due to Deroin, Kleptsyn and Navas regarding one-manifolds. We also establish an analogous result for closed subgroups of locally compact groups.</description>
