      <title>Complex Network Modelling with Power-law Activating Patterns and Its Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex network theory provides a unifying framework for the study of structured dynamic systems. The current literature emphasizes a widely reported phenomenon of intermittent interaction among network vertices. In this paper, we introduce a complex network model that considers the stochastic switching of individuals between activated and quiescent states at power-law rates and the corresponding evolutionary dynamics. By using the Markov chain and renewal theory, we discover a homogeneous stationary distribution of activated sizes in the network with power-law activating patterns and infer some statistical characteristics. To better understand the effect of power-law activating patterns, we study the two-person-two-strategy evolutionary game dynamics, demonstrate the absorbability of strategies, and obtain the critical cooperation conditions for prisoner's dilemmas in homogeneous networks without mutation. The evolutionary dynamics in real networks are also discussed. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze and understand social physics in time-evolving network systems.</description>

      <title>Prioritized Ranking Experimental Design Using Recommender Systems in Two-Sided Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interdependencies between units in online two-sided marketplaces complicate estimating causal effects in experimental settings. We propose a novel experimental design to mitigate the interference bias in estimating the total average treatment effect (TATE) of item-side interventions in online two-sided marketplaces. Our Two-Sided Prioritized Ranking (TSPR) design uses the recommender system as an instrument for experimentation. TSPR strategically prioritizes items based on their treatment status in the listings displayed to users. We designed TSPR to provide users with a coherent platform experience by ensuring access to all items and a consistent realization of their treatment by all users. We evaluate our experimental design through simulations using a search impression dataset from an online travel agency. Our methodology closely estimates the true simulated TATE, while a baseline item-side estimator significantly overestimates TATE.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Early Warnings using Machine Learning in an Online Game-experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stemming from physics and later applied to other fields such as ecology, the theory of critical transitions suggests that some regime shifts are preceded by statistical early warning signals. Reddit's r/place experiment, a large-scale social game, provides a unique opportunity to test these signals consistently across thousands of subsystems undergoing critical transitions. In r/place, millions of users collaboratively created compositions, or pixel-art drawings, in which transitions occur when one composition rapidly replaces another. We develop a machine-learning-based early warning system that combines the predictive power of multiple system-specific time series via gradient-boosted decision trees with memory-retaining features. Our method significantly outperforms standard early warning indicators. Trained on the 2022 r/place data, our algorithm detects half of the transitions occurring within 20 minutes at a false positive rate of just 3.7%. Its performance remains robust when tested on the 2023 r/place event, demonstrating generalizability across different contexts. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the predictions, we investigate the underlying drivers of warnings, which could be relevant to other complex systems, especially online social systems. We reveal an interplay of patterns preceding transitions, such as critical slowing down or speeding up, a lack of innovation or coordination, turbulent histories, and a lack of image complexity. These findings show the potential of machine learning indicators in socio-ecological systems for predicting regime shifts and understanding their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Pangraphs as models of higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs depict pairwise relationships between objects within a system. Higher-order interactions (HOIs), which involve more than two objects simultaneously, are common in nature. Such interactions can change the stability of a complex system. Hypergraphs can represent an HOI as an arbitrary subset of vertices. However, they fail to capture the specific roles of the vertices involved, which can be highly asymmetric, particularly in the case of interaction modifications.
  We introduce pangraphs, a robust and quantitative generalisation of graphs that accurately captures arbitrarily complex higher-order interactions. We demonstrate that several higher-order representations proposed in the literature are specific instances of pangraphs. Additionally, we introduce an incidence multilayer digraph representation of a pangraph, referred to as Levi digraph. We adapt degree and Katz centrality measures to the pangraph framework and show that a consistent generalisation of recursive graph measures cannot be simplified to a Levi digraph of a pangraph.
  We construct a pangraph for a real-world coffee agroecosystem and compare Katz centrality between its dihypergraph and pangraph representations, both analytically and numerically. The choice of representation significantly affects centrality values and alters vertex ranks. Additionally, we emphasise the use of real-valued incidence matrices to quantify interaction strengths and the roles of vertices within the system.</description>

      <title>Improved Community Detection using Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection approaches resolve complex networks into smaller groups (communities) that are expected to be relatively edge-dense and well-connected. The stochastic block model (SBM) is one of several approaches used to uncover community structure in graphs. In this study, we demonstrate that SBM software applied to various real-world and synthetic networks produces poorly-connected to disconnected clusters. We present simple modifications to improve the connectivity of SBM clusters, and show that the modifications improve accuracy using simulated networks.</description>

      <title>Improved Community Detection using Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying edge-dense communities that are also well-connected is an important aspect of understanding community structure. Prior work has shown that community detection methods can produce poorly connected communities, and some can even produce internally disconnected communities. In this study we evaluate the connectivity of communities obtained using Stochastic Block Models. We find that SBMs produce internally disconnected communities from real-world networks. We present a simple technique, Well-Connected Clusters (WCC), which repeatedly removes small edge cuts until the communities meet a user-specified threshold for well-connectivity. Our study using a large collection of synthetic networks based on clustered real-world networks shows that using WCC as a post-processing tool with SBM community detection typically improves clustering accuracy. WCC is fast enough to use on networks with millions of nodes and is freely available in open source form.</description>

      <title>Delving into LLM-assisted writing in biomedical publications through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate and revise text with human-level performance. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how wide-spread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this question for the field of biomedical research, we present an unbiased, large-scale approach: we study vocabulary changes in over 15 million biomedical abstracts from 2010--2024 indexed by PubMed, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This excess word analysis suggests that at least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, reaching 40% for some subcorpora. We show that LLMs have had an unprecedented impact on scientific writing in biomedical research, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>

      <title>PropaInsight: Toward Deeper Understanding of Propaganda in Terms of Techniques, Appeals, and Intent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propaganda plays a critical role in shaping public opinion and fueling disinformation. While existing research primarily focuses on identifying propaganda techniques, it lacks the ability to capture the broader motives and the impacts of such content. To address these challenges, we introduce propainsight, a conceptual framework grounded in foundational social science research, which systematically dissects propaganda into techniques, arousal appeals, and underlying intent. propainsight offers a more granular understanding of how propaganda operates across different contexts. Additionally, we present propagaze, a novel dataset that combines human-annotated data with high-quality synthetic data generated through a meticulously designed pipeline. Our experiments show that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle with propaganda analysis, but training with propagaze significantly improves performance. Fine-tuned Llama-7B-Chat achieves 203.4% higher text span IoU in technique identification and 66.2% higher BertScore in appeal analysis compared to 1-shot GPT-4-Turbo. Moreover, propagaze complements limited human-annotated data in data-sparse and cross-domain scenarios, showing its potential for comprehensive and generalizable propaganda analysis.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Non-Submodularity: Towards Constant Approximation for Network Immunization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a network with an ongoing epidemic, the network immunization problem seeks to identify a fixed number of nodes to immunize in order to maximize the number of infections prevented. A fundamental computational challenge in network immunization is that the objective function is generally neither submodular nor supermodular. Consequently, no efficient algorithm is known to consistently achieve a constant-factor approximation. Traditionally, this problem is partially addressed using proxy objectives that offer better approximation properties, but these indirect optimizations often introduce losses in effectiveness due to gaps between the proxy and natural objectives.
  In this paper, we overcome these fundamental barriers by leveraging the underlying stochastic structure of the diffusion process. Similar to the traditional influence objective, the immunization objective is an expectation expressed as a sum over deterministic instances. However, unlike the former, some of these terms are not submodular. Our key step is to prove that this sum has a bounded deviation from submodularity, enabling the classic greedy algorithm to achieve a constant-factor approximation for any sparse cascading network. We demonstrate that this approximation holds across various immunization settings and spread models.</description>

      <title>ChorusCVR: Chorus Supervision for Entire Space Post-Click Conversion Rate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimation is a vital task in many recommender systems of revenue businesses, e.g., e-commerce and advertising. In a perspective of sample, a typical CVR positive sample usually goes through a funnel of exposure to click to conversion. For lack of post-event labels for un-clicked samples, CVR learning task commonly only utilizes clicked samples, rather than all exposed samples as for click-through rate (CTR) learning task. However, during online inference, CVR and CTR are estimated on the same assumed exposure space, which leads to a inconsistency of sample space between training and inference, i.e., sample selection bias (SSB). To alleviate SSB, previous wisdom proposes to design novel auxiliary tasks to enable the CVR learning on un-click training samples, such as CTCVR and counterfactual CVR, etc. Although alleviating SSB to some extent, none of them pay attention to the discrimination between ambiguous negative samples (un-clicked) and factual negative samples (clicked but un-converted) during modelling, which makes CVR model lacks robustness. To full this gap, we propose a novel ChorusCVR model to realize debiased CVR learning in entire-space.</description>
