      <title>Unification in the description logic $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Description Logics are a formalism used in the knowledge representation, where the knowledge is captured in the form of concepts constructed in a controlled way from a restricted vocabulary. This allows one to test effectively for consistency of and the subsumption between the concepts. Unification of concepts may likewise become a useful tool in analysing the relations between concepts. The unification problem has been solved for the description logics $\mathcal{FL}_0$ and $\mathcal{EL}$. These small logics do not provide any means to express negation. Here we show an algorithm solving unification in $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$, the logic that extends $\mathcal{FL}_0$ with the bottom concept. Bottom allows one to express that two concepts are disjoint. Our algorithm runs in exponential time, with respect to the size of the problem.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic complexity of computing Gr\"obner bases of comaximal determinantal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n\times n$ matrix of homogeneous linear forms over a field $\Bbbk$. If the ideal $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ generated by minors of size $n-1$ is Cohen-Macaulay, then the Gulliksen-Neg{\aa}rd complex is a free resolution of $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$. It has recently been shown that by taking into account the syzygy modules for $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ which can be obtained from this complex, one can derive a refined signature-based Gr\"obner basis algorithm DetGB which avoids reductions to zero when computing a grevlex Gr\"obner basis for $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$. In this paper, we establish sharp complexity bounds on DetGB. To accomplish this, we prove several results on the sizes of reduced grevlex Gr\"obner bases of reverse lexicographic ideals, thanks to which we obtain two main complexity results which rely on conjectures similar to that of Fr\"oberg. The first one states that, in the zero-dimensional case, the size of the reduced grevlex Gr\"obner basis of $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ is bounded from below by $n^{6}$ asymptotically. The second, also in the zero-dimensional case, states that the complexity of DetGB is bounded from above by $n^{2\omega+3}$ asymptotically, where $2\le\omega\le 3$ is any complexity exponent for matrix multiplication over $\Bbbk$.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating Solution Paths of Polynomial Homotopies towards Singularities with PHCpack and phcpy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PHCpack is a software package for polynomial homotopy continuation, which provides a robust path tracker [Telen, Van Barel, Verschelde, SISC 2020]. This tracker computes the radius of convergence of Newton's method, estimates the distance to the nearest path, and then applies Pad\'{e} approximants to predict the next point on the path. A priori step size control is less sensitive to finely tuned tolerances than a posteriori step size control, and is therefore robust. The Python interface phcpy is extended with a new step-by-step tracker and is applied to experiment with extrapolation methods to accurately locate the singular points at the end of solution paths.</description>
