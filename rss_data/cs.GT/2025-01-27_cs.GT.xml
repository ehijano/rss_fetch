      <title>From signaling to interviews in random matching markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many two-sided labor markets, interviews are conducted before matches are formed. An increase in the number of interviews in the market for medical residencies raised the demand for signaling mechanisms, in which applicants can send a limited number of signals to communicate interest. We study the role of signaling mechanisms in reducing the number of interviews in centralized random matching markets with post-interview shocks. For the market to clear we focus on interim stability, which extends the notion of stability to ensure that agents do not regret not interviewing with each other. A matching is almost interim stable if it is interim stable after removing a vanishingly small fraction of agents.
  We first study signaling mechanisms in random matching markets when agents on the short side, long side, or both sides signal their top~$d$ preferred partners. Interviews graphs are formed by including all pairs where at least one party has signaled the other. We show that when $d = \omega(1)$, short-side signaling leads to almost interim stable matchings. Long-side signaling is only effective when the market is almost balanced. Conversely, when the interview shocks are negligible and $d = o(\log n)$, both-side signaling fails to achieve almost interim stability. For larger $d \ge \Omega(\log^2 n)$, short-side signaling achieves perfect interim stability, while long-side signaling fails in imbalanced markets. We build on our findings to propose a signaling mechanism for multi-tiered random markets. Our analysis identifies conditions under which signaling mechanisms are incentive compatible. A technical contribution is the analysis of a message-passing algorithm that efficiently determines interim stability and matching outcomes by leveraging local neighborhood structures.</description>

      <title>The Pseudo-Dimension of Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic contract design studies scenarios where a principal incentivizes an agent to exert effort on her behalf. In this work, we focus on settings where the agent's type is drawn from an unknown distribution, and formalize an offline learning framework for learning near-optimal contracts from sample agent types. A central tool in our analysis is the notion of pseudo-dimension from statistical learning theory. Beyond its role in establishing upper bounds on the sample complexity, pseudo-dimension measures the intrinsic complexity of a class of contracts, offering a new perspective on the tradeoffs between simplicity and optimality in contract design. Our main results provide essentially optimal tradeoffs between pseudo-dimension and representation error (defined as the loss in principal's utility) with respect to linear and bounded contracts. Using these tradeoffs, we derive sample- and time-efficient learning algorithms, and demonstrate their near-optimality by providing almost matching lower bounds on the sample complexity. Conversely, for unbounded contracts, we prove an impossibility result showing that no learning algorithm exists.
  Finally, we extend our techniques in three important ways. First, we provide refined pseudo-dimension and sample complexity guarantees for the combinatorial actions model, revealing a novel connection between the number of critical values and sample complexity. Second, we extend our results to menus of contracts, showing that their pseudo-dimension scales linearly with the menu size. Third, we adapt our algorithms to the online learning setting, where we show that, a polynomial number of type samples suffice to learn near-optimal bounded contracts. Combined with prior work, this establishes a formal separation between expert advice and bandit feedback for this setting.</description>

      <title>Fair Division Beyond Monotone Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of fairly dividing resources -- a cake or indivisible items -- amongst a set of agents with heterogeneous preferences. This problem has been extensively studied in the literature, however, a majority of the existing work has focused on settings wherein the agents' preferenes are monotone, i.e., increasing the quantity of resource doesn't decrease an agent's value for it. Despite this, the study of non-monotone preferences is as motivated as the study of monotone preferences. We focus on fair division beyond monotone valuations.
  We prove the existence of fair allocations, develop efficient algorithms to compute them, and prove lower bounds on the number of such fair allocations. For the case of indivisible items, we show that EF3 and EQ3 allocations always exist as long as the valuations of all agents are nonnegative. While nonnegativity suffices, we show that it's not required: EF3 allocations exist even if the valuations are (possibly negative) subadditive functions that satisfy a mild condition. In route to obtaining these results, we establish the existence of envy-free cake divisions for burnt cakes when the valuations are subadditive and the entire cake has a nonnegative value. This is in stark contrast to the well-known nonexistence of envy-free allocations for burnt cakes.
  In addition to the existence results, we develop an FPTAS for computing equitable cake divisions for nonnegative valuations. For indivisible items, we give an efficient algorithm to compute nearly equitable allocations which works when the valuations are nonnegative, or when they are subadditive subject to a mild condition. This result has implications beyond fair division, e.g., in facility, graph partitioning, among others. Finally, we show that such fair allocations are plenty in number, and increase exponentially (polynomially) in the number of agents (items).</description>

      <title>Accelerated Preference Elicitation with LLM-Based Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bidders in combinatorial auctions face significant challenges when describing their preferences to an auctioneer. Classical work on preference elicitation focuses on query-based techniques inspired from proper learning--often via proxies that interface between bidders and an auction mechanism--to incrementally learn bidder preferences as needed to compute efficient allocations. Although such elicitation mechanisms enjoy theoretical query efficiency, the amount of communication required may still be too cognitively taxing in practice.
  We propose a family of efficient LLM-based proxy designs for eliciting preferences from bidders using natural language. Our proposed mechanism combines LLM pipelines and DNF-proper-learning techniques to quickly approximate preferences when communication is limited. To validate our approach, we create a testing sandbox for elicitation mechanisms that communicate in natural language. In our experiments, our most promising LLM proxy design reaches approximately efficient outcomes with five times fewer queries than classical proper learning based elicitation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Thunderdome: Timelock-Free Rationally-Secure Virtual Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14418v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) offer a promising solution to address the limited transaction throughput of deployed blockchains. However, several attacks have recently been proposed that stress the vulnerability of PCNs to timelock and censoring attacks. To address such attacks, we introduce Thunderdome, the first timelock-free PCN. Instead, Thunderdome leverages the design rationale of virtual channels to extend a timelock-free payment channel primitive, thereby enabling multi-hop transactions without timelocks. Previous works either utilize timelocks or do not accommodate transactions between parties that do not share a channel.
  At its core, Thunderdome relies on a committee of non-trusted watchtowers, known as wardens, who ensure that no honest party loses funds, even when offline, during the channel closure process. We introduce tailored incentive mechanisms to ensure that all participants follow the protocol's correct execution. Besides a traditional security proof that assumes an honest majority of the committee, we conduct a formal game-theoretic analysis to demonstrate the security of Thunderdome when all participants, including wardens, act rationally. We implement a proof of concept of Thunderdome on Ethereum to validate its feasibility and evaluate its costs. Our evaluation shows that deploying Thunderdome, including opening the underlying payment channel, costs approximately \$15 (0.0089 ETH), while the worst-case cost for closing a channel is about \$7 (0.004 ETH).</description>

      <title>Designing Exploration Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a natural application of contract design in the context of sequential exploration problems. In our principal-agent setting, a search task is delegated to an agent. The agent performs a sequential exploration of $n$ boxes, suffers the exploration cost for each inspected box, and selects the content (called the prize) of one inspected box as outcome. Agent and principal obtain an individual value based on the selected prize. To influence the search, the principal a-priori designs a contract with a non-negative payment to the agent for each potential prize. The goal of the principal is to maximize her expected reward, i.e., value minus payment. Interestingly, this natural contract scenario shares close relations with the Pandora's Box problem.
  We show how to compute optimal contracts for the principal in several scenarios. A popular and important subclass is that of linear contracts, and we show how to compute optimal linear contracts in polynomial time. For general contracts, we obtain optimal contracts under the standard assumption that the agent suffers cost but obtains value only from the transfers by the principal. More generally, for general contracts with non-zero agent values for outcomes we show how to compute an optimal contract in two cases: (1) when each box has only one prize with non-zero value for principal and agent, (2) for i.i.d. boxes with a single prize with positive value for the principal.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Machines and Incomplete Information</title>

Abstract: The distribution of efficient individuals in the economy and the efforts that they will put in if they are hired, there are two important concerns for a technologically advanced firm. wants to open a new branch. The firm does not have information about the exact level of efficiency of an individual when she is hired. We call this situation incomplete information. The standard principal agent models assume that employees know their efficiency levels. Hence these models design incentive-compatible mechanisms. An incentive-compatible mechanism ensures that a participant does not have the incentive to misreport her efficiency level. This paper does not assume that employees know how efficient they are. This paper assumes that the production technology of the firm is intelligent, that is, the output of the machine reveals the efficiency levels of employees. Employees marginal contributions to the total output of the intelligent machine, the probability distribution of the levels of efficiency and employees costs of efforts together define a game of incomplete information. A characterization of ex-ante Nash Equilibrium is established. The results of the characterization formalize the relationship between the distribution of efficiency levels and the distribution of output.</description>

      <title>Discrete Single-Parameter Optimal Auction Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classic single-item auction setting of Myerson, but under the assumption that the buyers' values for the item are distributed over finite supports. Using strong LP duality and polyhedral theory, we rederive various key results regarding the revenue-maximizing auction, including the characterization through virtual welfare maximization and the optimality of deterministic mechanisms, as well as a novel, generic equivalence between dominant-strategy and Bayesian incentive compatibility.
  Inspired by this, we abstract our approach to handle more general auction settings, where the feasibility space can be given by arbitrary convex constraints, and the objective is a convex combination of revenue and social welfare. We characterize the optimal auctions of such systems as generalized virtual welfare maximizers, by making use of their KKT conditions, and we present an analogue of Myerson's payment formula for general discrete single-parameter auction settings. Additionally, we prove that total unimodularity of the feasibility space is a sufficient condition to guarantee the optimality of auctions with integral allocation rules.
  Finally, we demonstrate this KKT approach by applying it to a setting where bidders are interested in buying feasible flows on trees with capacity constraints, and provide a combinatorial description of the (randomized, in general) optimal auction.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Sum: Unlocking AI Agents Potential Through Market Forces</title>

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models has fundamentally transformed the capabilities of AI agents, enabling a new class of autonomous agents capable of interacting with their environment through dynamic code generation and execution. These agents possess the theoretical capacity to operate as independent economic actors within digital markets, offering unprecedented potential for value creation through their distinct advantages in operational continuity, perfect replication, and distributed learning capabilities. However, contemporary digital infrastructure, architected primarily for human interaction, presents significant barriers to their participation.
  This work presents a systematic analysis of the infrastructure requirements necessary for AI agents to function as autonomous participants in digital markets. We examine four key areas - identity and authorization, service discovery, interfaces, and payment systems - to show how existing infrastructure actively impedes agent participation. We argue that addressing these infrastructure challenges represents more than a technical imperative; it constitutes a fundamental step toward enabling new forms of economic organization. Much as traditional markets enable human intelligence to coordinate complex activities beyond individual capability, markets incorporating AI agents could dramatically enhance economic efficiency through continuous operation, perfect information sharing, and rapid adaptation to changing conditions. The infrastructure challenges identified in this work represent key barriers to realizing this potential.</description>
