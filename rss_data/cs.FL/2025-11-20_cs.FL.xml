      <title>Computing Sound and Accurate Upper and Lower Bounds on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Value Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.</description>

      <title>Behavior Trees vs Executable Ontologies: a Comparative Analysis of Robot Control Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper compares two distinct approaches to modeling robotic behavior: imperative Behavior Trees (BTs) and declarative Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework. BTs structure behavior hierarchically using control-flow, whereas EO represents the domain as a temporal, event-based semantic graph driven by dataflow rules. We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control. EO supports runtime model modification, full temporal traceability, and a unified representation of data, logic, and interface - features that are difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve with BTs, although BTs excel in established, predictable scenarios. The comparison is grounded in a practical mobile manipulation task. This comparison highlights the respective operational strengths of each approach in dynamic, evolving robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in Lean4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive formalization in the Lean4 theorem prover of the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, which characterizes regular local rings as those Noetherian local rings with finite global dimension. Rather than following the well-known proof that computes the projective dimension of the residue field via quotient by regular sequences and uses the Koszul complex to bound the cotangent space dimension by the global dimension, our approach is built systematically on the formalization of depth defined via the vanishing of Ext functors. We establish key homological results including Rees' theorem, the Auslander--Buchsbaum formula, and Ischebeck's theorem, and further develop the theories of Cohen--Macaulay modules and rings, including a complete formalization of the unmixedness theorem for Cohen--Macaulay rings. To prove the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, we show that maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over regular local rings are free and establish a weakened form of the Ferrand--Vasconcelos theorem specific for the unique maximal ideal. As corollaries, we deduce that regularity can be checked at maximal ideals and formalize Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem. This work demonstrates how homological algebra can be effectively employed in the formalization of commutative algebra, providing extensive infrastructure for future developments in the field.</description>
