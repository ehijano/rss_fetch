      <title>Advancing Exchange Rate Forecasting: Leveraging Machine Learning and AI for Enhanced Accuracy in Global Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of foreign exchange rates, such as the US Dollar (USD) to Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), plays a pivotal role in global financial markets, influencing trade, investments, and economic stability. This study leverages historical USD/BDT exchange rate data from 2018 to 2023, sourced from Yahoo Finance, to develop advanced machine learning models for accurate forecasting. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed, achieving an exceptional accuracy of 99.449%, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9858, and a test loss of 0.8523, significantly outperforming traditional methods like ARIMA (RMSE 1.342). Additionally, a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is applied for directional prediction, with backtesting on a $10,000 initial capital revealing a 40.82% profitable trade rate, though resulting in a net loss of $20,653.25 over 49 trades. The study analyzes historical trends, showing a decline in BDT/USD rates from 0.012 to 0.009, and incorporates normalized daily returns to capture volatility. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning in forex forecasting, offering traders and policymakers robust tools to mitigate risks. Future work could integrate sentiment analysis and real-time economic indicators to further enhance model adaptability in volatile markets.</description>

      <title>Financial sentiment analysis using FinBERT with application in predicting stock movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we integrate sentiment analysis within a financial framework by leveraging FinBERT, a fine-tuned BERT model specialized for financial text, to construct an advanced deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our objective is to forecast financial market trends with greater accuracy. To evaluate our model's predictive capabilities, we apply it to a comprehensive dataset of stock market news and perform a comparative analysis against standard BERT, standalone LSTM, and the traditional ARIMA models. Our findings indicate that incorporating sentiment analysis significantly enhances the model's ability to anticipate market fluctuations. Furthermore, we propose a suite of optimization techniques aimed at refining the model's performance, paving the way for more robust and reliable market prediction tools in the field of AI-driven finance.</description>

      <title>The Subtle Interplay between Square-root Impact, Order Imbalance &amp; Volatility: A Unifying Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to reconcile several apparently contradictory observations in market microstructure: is the famous ''square-root law'' of metaorder impact that decays with time compatible with the random-walk nature of prices and the linear impact of order imbalances? Can one entirely explain the volatility of prices as resulting from the flow of uninformed metaorders that mechanically impact prices? We introduce a new theoretical framework to describe metaorders with different signs, sizes and durations, which all impact prices as a square-root of volume but with a subsequent time decay. We show that, as in the original propagator model, price diffusion is ensured by the long memory of cross-correlations between metaorders. In order to account for the effect of strongly fluctuating volumes $q$ of individual trades, we further introduce two $q$-dependent exponents, which allows us to account for the way the moments of generalized volume imbalance and the correlation between price changes and generalized order flow imbalance scales with $T$. We predict in particular that the corresponding power-laws depend in a non-monotonic fashion on a parameter $a$ that allows one to put the same weight on all child orders or overweight large orders, a behaviour clearly borne out by empirical data. We also predict that the correlation between price changes and volume imbalances should display a maximum as a function of $a$, which again matches observations. Such noteworthy agreement between theory and data suggests that our framework correctly captures the basic mechanism at the heart of price formation, namely the average impact of metaorders. We argue that our results support the ''Order-Driven'' theory of excess volatility, and are at odds with the idea that a ''Fundamental'' component accounts for a large share of the volatility of financial markets.</description>
