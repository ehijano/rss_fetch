      <title>Molecular adhesion assay for biopolymer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19981v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular adhesion plays a central role in many biological systems, yet existing methods to quantify adhesive strength often struggle to bridge the gap between single-molecule resolution and biologically relevant environments. Here, we present a scalable micromagnetic bead-based adhesion assay capable of quantifying detachment forces under physiologically meaningful conditions. Designed to probe mucoadhesion in the context of mucociliary clearance, our system applies controlled magnetic forces to ligand-coated beads adhered to functionalized substrates and tracks detachment events using high-speed microscopy and calibrated z-displacement mapping. The platform combines substrate- and bead-side surface chemistry control with high-throughput imaging and in situ force calibration via Stokes drag. We demonstrate the ability to distinguish sub-nanonewton to nanonewton force regimes across a range of bead-substrate pairings, including COOH-COOH, PEG-PEG, and cell culture-derived human bronchial epithelial (HBE) mucus interactions. Surface functionalization was validated via fluorescence imaging and zeta potential measurements, while detachment forces were used to estimate binding energy and infer dissociation constants. This assay enables detailed characterization of multivalent, force-sensitive adhesive interactions and offers a powerful new approach for studying bioadhesive systems, including mucus-pathogen interactions and drug delivery materials.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive characterization of nonlinear viscoelastic properties of arterial tissues using guided-wave optical coherence elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of arterial walls are critical for maintaining vascular function under pulsatile pressure and are closely linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Despite advances in imaging and elastography, comprehensive characterization of the complex mechanical behavior of arterial tissues remains challenging. Here, we present a broadband guided-wave optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique, grounded in viscoelasto-acoustic theory, for quantifying the nonlinear viscoelastic, anisotropic, and layer-specific properties of arterial walls with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our results reveal a strong stretch dependence of arterial viscoelasticity, with increasing prestress leading to a reduction in tissue viscosity. Under mechanical loading, the adventitia becomes significantly stiffer than the media, attributable to engagement of collagen fibers. Chemical degradation of collagen fibers highlighted their role in nonlinear viscoelasticity. This study demonstrates the potential of OCE as a powerful tool for detailed profiling of vascular biomechanics, with applications in basic research and future clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Atom probe tomography of hydrated biomacromolecules: preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The folding and structure of biomacromolecules depend on the 3D distributions of their constituents, which ultimately controls their functionalities and interactions with other biomacromolecules. Atom probe tomography (APT) with its unparalleled compositional sensitivity at nanoscale spatial resolution, could provide complementary information to cryo-electron microscopy, yet routine APT analysis of biomacromolecules in their native state remains challenging. Here, a ferritin solution was used as a model system. Following plunge freezing in liquid nitrogen, cryogenic lift-out and cryo-APT analysis were performed. Elements from the ferritin core and shell are detected yet particles seem destroyed. We hence demonstrate the feasibility of preparing and analyzing bulk hydrated biological samples using APT, however, the cooling was too slow to vitrify the solution. This caused irrecoverable damage to the protein shell surrounding the ferritin particles due to ice crystal formation. We report on preliminary data from high-pressure frozen (HPF) deionized (DI) water, demonstrating a proof-ofprinciple experiments that intact biomacromolecules could be analyzed through a similar workflow in the future. We report on many trials (and errors) on the use of different materials for substrates and different substrate geometries, and provide a perspective on the challenges we faced to facilitate future studies across the community.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent transport coefficients in two-dimensional cellular aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale collective behavior of biological systems can be characterized by macroscopic transport, which arises from the non-equilibrium microscopic interactions among individual constituents. A prominent example is the formation of dynamic aggregates by motile eukaryotic cells or bacteria mediated by active contractile forces. In this work, we develop the two-dimensional fluctuating hydrodynamics theory based on the microscopic dynamics of a model system of aggregation by \textit{Neisseria gonorrhoeae} bacteria. The derivation of two macroscopic transport coefficients of bulk diffusivity and conductivity which determine hydrodynamic current of cells is the central result of this work. By showing how transport coefficients depend on cell density and microscopic parameters of the system we predict transport slowdown during the colony formation process. This study provides valuable analytical tools for quantifying hydrodynamic transport in experimental systems involving cellular aggregation occurring due to intermittent contractile dipole forces.</description>

      <title>Two fluctuating interfaces with sticking interactions: Invariant measures and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a non-equilibrium stochastic model of two fluctuating interfaces which interact through short-range attractive interactions at their points of contact. Beginning from an entangled state, the system exhibits diverse dynamics -- ranging from fast transients with small lifetimes to ultraslow evolution through quasi-stationary states -- and reaches stuck, entangled, or detached steady states. Near the stuck-detached transition, two distinct dynamical modes of evolution co-occur. When the two surfaces evolve through similar dynamics (both Edwards-Wilkinson or both Kardar-Parisi-Zhang), the invariant measure is determined and found to have an inhomogeneous product form. This exact steady state is shown to be the measure of the equilibrium Poland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation.</description>

      <title>Physical Constraints on the Rhythmicity of the Biological Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circadian rhythms in living organisms are temporal orders emerging from biochemical circuits driven out of equilibrium. Here, we study how the rhythmicity of a biochemical clock is shaped using the KaiABC system. A phase diagram constructed as a function of KaiC and KaiA concentrations reveals a sharply bounded limit-cycle region, which naturally explains arrhythmia upon protein over-expression. Beyond the Hopf bifurcation, intrinsic noise enables regular oscillation via coherence resonance. Within the limit-cycle region, greater rhythmic precision incurs a higher energetic cost, following the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The cost-minimizing period of the KaiABC clock ($\sim$21-hr) is close enough to entrain to 24-hr cycle of environment. Our study substantiates universal physical constraints on the robustness, precision, and efficiency of noisy biological clocks.</description>

      <title>Local stabilizability implies global controllability in catalytic reaction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling complex reaction networks is a fundamental challenge in the fields of physics, biology, and systems engineering. Here, we prove a general principle for catalytic reaction systems with kinetics where the reaction order and the stoichiometric coefficient match: the local stabilizability of a given state implies global controllability within its stoichiometric compatibility class. In other words, if a target state can be maintained against small perturbations, the system can be controlled from any initial condition to that state. This result highlights a tight link between the local and global dynamics of nonlinear chemical reaction systems, providing a mathematical criterion for global reachability that is often elusive in high-dimensional systems. The finding illuminate the robustness of biochemical systems and offers a way to control catalytic reaction systems in a generic framework.</description>

      <title>How Easy Is It to Learn Motion Models from Widefield Fluorescence Single Particle Tracks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion models (i.e., transition probability densities) are often deduced from fluorescence widefield tracking experiments by analyzing single-particle trajectories post-processed from data. This analysis immediately raises the question: To what degree is our ability to learn motion models impacted by analyzing post-processed trajectories versus raw measurements? To answer this question, we mathematically formulate a data likelihood for diffraction-limited fluorescence widefield tracking experiments. In particular, we make the likelihood's dependence on the motion model versus the emission (or measurement) model explicit. The emission model describes how photons emitted by biomolecules are distributed in space according to the optical point spread function, with intensities subsequently integrated over a pixel, and convoluted with camera noise. Logic dictates that if the likelihood is primarily informed by the motion model, it should be straightforward to learn the motion model from the post-processed trajectory. Contrarily, if the majority of the likelihood is dominated by the emission model, the post-processed trajectory inferred from data is primarily informed by the emission model, and very little information on the motion model permeates into the post-processed trajectories analyzed downstream to learn motion models. Indeed, we find that for typical diffraction-limited fluorescence experiments, the emission model often robustly contributes approximately 99% to the likelihood, leaving motion models to explain a meager 1% of the data. This result immediately casts doubt on our ability to reliably learn motion models from post-processed data, raising further questions on the significance of motion models learned thus far from post-processed single-particle trajectories from single-molecule widefield fluorescence tracking experiments.</description>

      <title>Estimating the potential of ionizing radiation-induced radiolysis for microbial metabolism on terrestrial planets and satellites with rarefied atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation is known to have a destructive effect on biology by causing damage to the DNA, cells, and production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), among other things. While direct exposure to high radiation dose is indeed not favorable for biological activity, ionizing radiation can, and in some cases is known to produce a number of biologically useful products. One such mechanism is the production of biologically useful products via charged particle-induced radiolysis. Some of the byproducts are impossible to produce with lower-energy radiation (such as sunlight), opening up new avenues for life to utilize them. The main objective of the manuscript is to explore the concept of a Radiolytic Habitable Zone (RHZ), where the chemistry of GCR-induced radiolysis can be potentially utilized for metabolic activity. We first calculate the energy deposition and the electron production rate using the GEANT4 numerical model, then estimate the current production and possible chemical pathways which could be useful for supporting biological activity on Mars, Europa and Enceladus. The concept of RHZ provides a novel framework for understanding the potential for life in high-radiation environments. By combining energy deposition calculations with the energy requirements of microbial cells, we have defined the RHZ for Mars, Europa, and Enceladus. These zones represent the regions where radiolysis-driven energy production is sufficient to sustain microbial metabolism. We find that bacterial cell density is highest in Enceladus, followed by Mars and Europa. We discuss the implications of these mechanisms for the habitability of such objects in the Solar system and beyond.</description>

      <title>Stability of co-annular active and passive confined fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The translation and shape deformations of a passive viscous Newtonian droplet immersed in an active nematic liquid crystal under circular confinement are analyzed using a linear stability analysis. We focus on the case of a sharply aligned active nematic in the limit of strong elastic relaxation in two dimensions. Using an active liquid crystal model, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to study the growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active and elastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile and contractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presented in terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillary stresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. We also extend our theory to analyze the inverse scenario, namely, the stability of an active nematic droplet surrounded by a passive viscous layer. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of capillary, active, elastic, and viscous stresses in governing droplet stability. The instabilities uncovered here may be relevant to a plethora of biological active systems, from the dynamics of passive droplets in bacterial suspensions to the organization of subcellular compartments inside the cell and cell nucleus.</description>
