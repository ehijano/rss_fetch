      <title>Anomalous Thickness Dependence of the Vortex Pearl Length in Few-Layer NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of multiple types of orders is a common thread in condensed matter physics and unconventional superconductors. The nature of superconducting orders may be unveiled by analyzing local perturbations such as vortices. For thin films, the vortex magnetic profile is characterized by the Pearl-length {\Lambda}, which is inversely proportional to the 2D superfluid density; hence, normally, also inversely proportional to the film thickness, d. Here we employ the scanning SQUID-on-tip microscopy to measure {\Lambda} in NbSe2 flakes with thicknesses ranging from N=3 to 53 layers. For N&gt;10, we find the expected dependence {\Lambda}{\varpropto}1/d. However, six-layer films show a sharp increase of {\Lambda} deviating by a factor of three from the expected value. This value remains fixed for N=3 to 6. This unexpected behavior suggests the competition between two orders; one residing only on the first and last layers of the film while the other prevails in all layers.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a dark matter particle.</description>

      <title>Engineering nonequilibrium superconducting phases in a voltage-driven superconductor under an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate nonequilibrium properties of a normal metal-superconductor-normal metal (NSN) junction under an external magnetic field. When a bias voltage is applied between the normal-metal leads, the confined superconductor is driven out of equilibrium, resulting in a nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution function having a two-step structure. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function technique, we determine a comprehensive phase diagram of the nonequilibrium superconductor. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between Zeeman-split energy bands and the nonequilibrium distribution function gives rise to a rich phase structure. Notably, we find that superconductivity destroyed by a strong external magnetic field revives by applying the bias voltage. This reentrant phenomenon is shown to originate from four effective "Fermi surfaces" that result from the combination of Zeeman-split energy bands and the two-step structure in the nonequilibrium distribution function. Our results demonstrate the possibility of controlling quantum states of matter through the combined engineering of energy band structures and distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Observation of collective charge excitations in a cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent symmetry breakings in condensed matter systems are often intimately linked to collective excitations. For example, the intertwined spin-charge stripe order in cuprate superconductors is associated with spin and charge excitations. While the collective behavior of spin excitations is well established, the nature of charge excitations remains to be understood. Here we present a high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge excitations in the stripe-ordered cuprate La$_{1.675}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$. The RIXS spectra consist of both charge and phonon excitations around the charge ordering wave vector. By modeling the momentum-dependent phonon intensity, the charge-excitation spectral weight is extracted for a wide range of energy. As such, we reveal the highly dispersive nature of the charge excitations, with an energy scale comparable to the spin excitations. Since charge order and superconductivity in cuprates are possibly driven by the same electronic correlations, determining the interaction strength underlying charge order is essential to establishing a comprehensive microscopic model of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Robust High-Temperature Superconductivity in Li3IrH9 at Moderate Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides has sparked intensive efforts to find superconducting hydrides that are stable at low pressure or even ambient pressure. Herein, we present the ternary hydride Li3IrH9 as an exceptional candidate, which exhibits thermodynamic stability above 100 GPa and dynamic stability down to 8 GPa, exhibiting a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of up to 113 K. In this structure, the broadening and overlapping between the electronic bands of the Ir-H antibonding states and the neighboring H ions result in the intrinsic metallicity of the hydrogen sublattice and drive the emergence of hydrogen-dominated significant electronic states at the Fermi level. Within this specific mechanism, the softened optical modes generated by hydrogen atoms encapsulated in the center of the Li octahedron play a critical role in strengthening electron-phonon coupling, an effect that remains robust even under high-pressures. Through high-throughput computational screening, we further identified a new family of superconductors derived from this prototype, including Li3RhH9 (Tc = 124 K at 20 GPa) and Li3CoH9 (Tc = 80 K at 10 GPa). This work provides original theoretical insights to accelerate the discovery of emerging hydride superconductor families that exhibit robust high-temperature superconductivity under moderate-pressures, along with promising potential for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Identical Suppression of Spin and Charge Density Wave Transitions in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ by Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in nickelate systems is a key focus of condensed matter research. Microscopic insights into magnetism, which emerges near superconductivity, require a synergistic approach that combines complementary techniques with controlled parameter tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), resistivity, and specific heat measurements. At ambient pressure, two incommensurate spin density wave (SDW) transitions were identified at $T_{\rm SDW} \simeq 132$ K and $T^\ast \simeq 90$ K. NPD experiments revealed that the magnetic wave vector $(0, 0.574, 0)$ remains unchanged below 130 K, indicating that the transition at $T^\ast$ corresponds to a reorientation of the Ni magnetic moments within a similar magnetic structure. Comparison of the observed internal magnetic fields with dipole-field calculations reveals a magnetic structure consistent with an antiferromagnetically coupled SDW on the outer two Ni layers, with smaller moments on the inner Ni layer. The internal fields at muon stopping sites appeared abruptly at $T_{\rm SDW}$, suggesting a first-order-like nature of the SDW transition, which is closely linked to the charge density wave (CDW) order occurring at the same temperature ($T_{\rm SDW} = T_{\rm CDW}$). Under applied pressure, all transition temperatures, including $T_{\rm SDW}$, $T^\ast$, and $T_{\rm CDW}$, were suppressed at a nearly uniform rate of $\simeq -13$ K/GPa. This behavior contrasts with the double-layer RP nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where pressure enhances the separation of the density wave transitions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electron-phonon interactions in Migdal-Eliashberg theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting systems based on attractive electron-phonon interactions are the ones which are best understood at a fundamental level. They are well described using Eliashberg theory, which, unlike BCS theory, explicitly takes into account phonon dynamics. It is most often assumed that only linear electron-phonon interactions are relevant. However, for some superconductors like MgB$_2$ or hydride based superconductors, nonlinear electron-phonon interactions are known to contribute significantly, which is not taken into account in conventional Eliashberg theory. We provide a modification to Eliashberg theory by introducing nonlinear electron-phonon interactions. We show that the Eliashberg equations remain unchanged apart from a nonlinear extension of the Eliashberg spectral function. This extended spectral function can be used as a baseline for future ab initio calculations. We use it to construct an analytical toy model and show that the nonlinear electron-phonon coupling affects the superconducting gap function on the imaginary and real axis and causes an increase in the superconducting critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconducting correlations in the Emery model and its connections to strange metallic transport and normal state coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped two-dimensional three-band Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear transport behavior, the three-band model shows a low temperature resistivity curvature indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. Evidence has also been found in thermodynamic and superconducting measurements, which suggests that some degree of coherence in transport might be necessary for the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, further implying a possible connection between superconducting and transport behaviors.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric fluctuations of interfering Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium states produced by electric and thermal voltages ($V$, $V_T$) provide a straightforward insight into underlying degrees of freedom of composite nanostructures and are of particular interest to probe Majorana bound states. Here we explore fluctuations of thermoelectric currents at finite frequencies $\omega$ in a quantum dot coupled to two interfering Majorana bound states. At small $V$ we find that in the emission spectra the differential thermoelectric quantum noise $\partial S^&gt;/\partial V_T$ shows an antiresonance whereas in the absorption spectra Majorana interference induces an antiresonance-resonance pair. At large $V$ this pair is preserved whereas the emission antiresonance turns into an antiresonance-resonance pair identical to the absorption one making $\partial S^&gt;/\partial V_T$ antisymmetric in the frequency $\omega$. This antisymmetry distinguishes Majorana behavior from the one induced by Andreev bound states and does not break at higher temperatures making it attractive for experiments on Majorana interference via thermoelectric fluctuation response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term, and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced strong zero modes in short quantum dot chains with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the emergence of strong zero modes in a two-site chain consisting of two quantum dots coupled due to a central dot that mediates electron hopping and singlet superconducting pairing. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry, the on-site Coulomb interaction leads to a three-fold ground-state degeneracy when tuning the system to a sweet spot as a function of the inter-dot couplings. This degeneracy is protected against changes of the dot energies in the same way as "poor man's'' Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains. In the limit of strong interactions, this protection is maximal and the entire spectrum becomes triply degenerate, indicating the emergence of a ''poor man's'' version of a strong zero mode. We explain the degeneracy and protection by constructing corresponding Majorana Kramers-pair operators and $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermion operators. The strong zero modes share many properties of Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains, including the stability of zero-bias peaks in the conductance and the behavior upon coupling to an additional quantum dot. However, they can be distinguished through finite-bias spectroscopy and the exhibit a different behavior when scaling to longer chains.</description>
