      <title>Cross-polarized and Stable Second Harmonic Generation from Monocrystalline Copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a powerful surface-specific probe for centrosymmetric materials, with broad relevance to energy and biological interfaces. Plasmonic nanomaterials have been extensively utilized to amplify this nonlinear response. Yet, material instability has constrained most studies to gold, despite the significance of plasmonic metals such as copper for catalysis. Here, we demonstrate stable and anisotropic SHG from monocrystalline copper, overcoming long-standing challenges associated with surface degradation. By leveraging an on-substrate synthesis approach that yields atomically flat and oxidation-resistant Cu microflakes, we enable reliable SHG measurements and reveal a strong cross-polarized response with C3v surface symmetry. The SHG signal remains stable over several minutes of continuous femtosecond excitation, highlighting the optical robustness of the Cu microflakes. These results reinforce the viability of monocrystalline Cu as a robust platform for nonlinear nanophotonics and surface-sensitive spectroscopy, expanding the range of copper-based optical applications.</description>

      <title>The next dimension: Digital holography for 3D interferometric scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide detailed experimental guidelines for implementing digital holography in the context of high-sensitivity interferometric scattering (iSCAT) based nanosizing applications. Our approach relies on interferometry via the highly versatile off-axis implementation of digital holography, which offers key advantages over more traditional strategies. After a brief theoretical discussion of off-axis holography and its differences and similarities with iSCAT, typical experimental implementations and digital data-processing steps are presented. Key experimental parameters and strategies to achieve optimal performance are also highlighted. Following these experimental aspects, we focus on digital post-processing routines that enable digital refocussing and 3D particle tracking as well as pupil function aberration correction. We then conclude with a few examples highlighting the broad applicability of digital holography for nanosizing and particle characterisation applications as well as an outlook for future applications.</description>

      <title>Free Extension of Topological States via Double-zero-index Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological states, known for their robustness against disorder, offer promising avenues for disorder-resistant devices. However, their intrinsic spatial confinement at interfaces imposes geometric constraints that limit the scalability of topological functionalities. Here, we propose a strategy to overcome this limitation by using double-zero-index media to expand topological interfaces. Although occupying finite space, these media are optically equivalent to infinitesimal points, effectively altering the geometry of topological interfaces and breaking conventional bulk-edge correspondence. This strategy enables the spatial expansion of uniform topological states beyond their native interface, offering new possibilities for topological photonic devices. We have verified this behavior through numerical simulations and microwave experiments in a two-dimensional photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice. Our findings offer a universal framework to overcome the inherent dimensional limitations of topological states, with implications extending to general wave systems such as acoustic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Octave Spanning Visible to SWIR Integrated Coil-Stabilized Brillouin Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow linewidth stabilized lasers are central to precision applications that operate across the visible to short-wave infrared wavelengths, including optical clocks, quantum sensing and computing, ultra-low noise microwave generation, and fiber sensing. Today, these spectrally pure sources are realized using multiple external cavity tabletop lasers locked to bulk-optic free-space reference cavities. Integration of this technology will enable portable precision applications with improved reliability and robustness. Here, we report wavelength-flexible design and operation, over more than an octave span, of an integrated coil-resonator-stabilized Brillouin laser architecture. Leveraging a versatile two-stage noise reduction approach, we achieve low linewidths and high stability with chip-scale laser designs based on the ultra-low-loss, CMOS-compatible silicon nitride platform. We report operation at 674 and 698 nm for applications to strontium neutral and trapped-ion clocks, quantum sensing and computing, and at 1550 nm for applications to fiber sensing and ultra-low phase noise microwave generation. Over this range we demonstrate frequency noise reduction from 1 Hz to 10 MHz resulting in 1.0 Hz -17 Hz fundamental and 181 Hz - 630 Hz integral linewidths and an Allan deviation of 6.5 x 10-13 at 1 ms for 674 nm, 6.0 x 10-13 at 15 ms for 698 nm, and 2.6 x10-13 at 15 ms for 1550 nm. This represents the lowest achieved linewidths and highest stability for integrated stabilized Brillouin lasers over an order of magnitude improvement in operating wavelength range. These results unlock the potential of integrated, ultra-low-phase-noise stabilized lasers for precision applications and further integration in systems-on-chip solutions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous photonic and phononic bandgaps in a hexagonal lattice geometry with gradually transforming circular-to-triangular air gap holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of photonic and phononic bandgaps within a single scalable architecture promises transformative advances in optomechanical and acousto-optic devices. Here, we design and simulate a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice in silicon with air-gap holes that transition smoothly from circular to triangular via tuneable geometrical parameters R and l. This transformation enables suppression of both electromagnetic and elastic wave modes through Bragg scattering and symmetry modulation. We demonstrate that systematic variation of R and l allows tuning of photonic and phononic bandgaps by 18% and 21% respectively. This possibility of geometrical tuning of bandgaps provide strong foundations for applications in Bragg filters, sensors etc. without the need for complex defects and exotic materials.</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision Photonic Computing with 3D Electronic-Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose advancing photonic in-memory computing through three-dimensional photonic-electronic integrated circuits using phase-change materials (PCM) and AlGaAs-CMOS technology. These circuits offer high precision (greater than 12 bits), scalability (greater than 1024 by 1024), and massive parallelism (greater than 1 million operations) across the wavelength, spatial, and temporal domains at ultra-low power (less than 1 watt per PetaOPS). Monolithically integrated hybrid PCM-AlGaAs memory resonators handle coarse-precision iterations (greater than 5-bit most significant bit precision) through reversible PCM phase transitions. Electro-optic memristive tuning enables fine-precision updates (greater than 8-bit least significant bit precision), resulting in over 12-bit precision for in-memory computing. The use of low-loss PCM (less than 0.01 dB per cm) and electro-optical tuning yields memristive optical resonators with high Q-factors (greater than 1 million), low insertion loss, and low tuning power. A W by W photonic tensor core composed of PCM-AlGaAs memresonators performs general matrix multiplication (GEMM) across W wavelengths from optical frequency combs, with minimal crosstalk and loss. Hierarchical scaling in the wavelength domain (K) and spatial domain (L) enables this system to address high-dimensional (N) scientific partial differential equation (PDE) problems in a single constant-time operation, compared to the conventional quadratic-time (N squared) computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Reflectionless Mode Exceptional Degeneracies via Emergent Local Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new kind of physically realizable exceptional point degeneracies (EPDs) corresponding to synthetic reflectionless modes (SRM). These are solutions of an auxiliary wave operator that is defined in synthetic frequency dimensions and describe incoming reflectionless waves onto a Floquet-driven cavity. The SRM-EPD emerges as a consequence of a spontaneous local PT-symmetry imposed on the auxiliary operator via appropriate Floquet driving. Its presence signifies the possibility to design wavefronts and time-modulated schemes with up/down targeted frequency conversion and flat transmission spectra. The theory is validated via simulations with driven RF resonators.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Frequency Noise Cancellation in Nanomechanical Resonators using Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and minimizing the sources of frequency noise in nanomechanical resonators is crucial for many sensing applications. In this work, we report an ultracoherent perimeter-mode nanomechanical resonator co-integrated with an on-chip optical cavity. This device combines low thermomechanical force noise and low detector noise, allowing us to study its intrinsic frequency fluctuations in detail. We find that the fluctuations of two mechanical modes are strongly correlated. Moreover, we demonstrate the generation of a signal at the frequency difference between the two modes directly on chip via nonlinear optomechanical transduction. This `difference signal' has vastly reduced intrinsic frequency fluctuations and can be used for frequency tracking with high precision, as we establish in a proof-of-principle experiment.</description>

      <title>Topological invariants and topological charges in photonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology in photonics comes in two distinct flavors: global and local. Global topology considers invariants that are obtained by integrating over the energy band, whereas local topology considers defects, typically vortices, in the far-field emission. These topologies are described by a wide range of models built in both real and momentum space, which are connected only by computationally expensive numerical methods that lack physical intuition. Here we propose a general framework based on a real-space Hamiltonian capable of describing electric field as a vector in both near- and far fields, allowing us to bridge between topological defects in the far-field and global topological invariants. The proposed Hamiltonian is constructed from the symmetry-representations of the lattice, is deformable to both atomic localized-mode (tight-binding) and photonic delocalized-mode (long-range) limits, and allows for independent control over the energies of eigenmodes of different symmetries at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. This symmetry-based approach enables the design of structures with almost arbitrary topological properties and is not limited to photonic systems, but could apply to any system with engineered real-space couplings.</description>

      <title>All Photonic Isolator using Atomically Thin (2D) Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that two-dimensional (2D) Bi2Te3 exhibits strong light-matter interaction, enabling a broadband Kerr nonlinear optical response. This characteristic is advantageous for nonreciprocal light propagation in passive photonic isolators. Using Spatial Self-Phase Modulation (SSPM) spectroscopy, self-induced diffraction patterns in the far field were observed at excitation wavelengths of 650 nm, 532 nm, and 405 nm to calculate the nonlinear refractive index (n2) and the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (chi^(3)) of the synthesized 2D Bi2Te3.
  The results show that 2D Bi2Te3 possesses a significantly higher nonlinear refractive index than graphene. The laser-induced hole coherence effect is responsible for the large magnitude of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility. Surface engineering techniques were also employed to enhance the response speed of the photonic system.
  Complementary ab initio simulations were performed to gain further insight into the observed nonlinear behavior. Leveraging the strong Kerr nonlinearity of 2D Bi2Te3, a nonlinear photonic isolator that breaks time-reversal symmetry and enables unidirectional light propagation was demonstrated. This work establishes Bi2Te3 as a novel 2D material for nonlinear photonics, expanding its potential applications in detectors, modulators, and optical switches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of ultraviolet radiation (275 nm) on the Raman spectra of amino acid microcrystals: alanine, glycine, tryptophan was studied. The position of some lines in the spectra after irradiation has slightly shifted towards high energies. The main effect: observation of changes in the relative intensities of the components of the Raman spectra after irradiation of microcrystals. It has been suggested that this change is due to the reorientation of some molecules under the influence of radiation</description>

      <title>Polarisation multiplexing ring-cavity fibre laser for dual-comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis presents the development and characterisation of a polarisation-multiplexing ring-cavity fibre laser for dual-comb generation. It explores the underlying physics, implementation, and potential uses of this innovative laser system, especially in LIDAR technology. Conventional dual-frequency comb systems for metrology use two optical frequency combs synchronised via complex feedback loops, which suffer from phase-locking issues and raise system cost and fragility. In contrast, single-cavity dual comb systems generate two combs with slightly different repetition rates in the same cavity, ensuring mutual coherence and noise cancellation. However, these systems often display unstable regimes and are typically demonstrated only in laboratories. This thesis aims to design, build, characterise, and optimise a single-cavity polarisation multiplexed fibre laser that produces dual optical frequency combs with enough stability and precision for dual-comb LIDAR. The system simplifies generation while enhancing applicability. Secondary goals include analysing the laser intensity dynamics and collaborating with a company to address commercial needs and challenges in LIDAR, particularly under harsh conditions. Results show stable dual-comb generation with minimal drift (1 Hz per hour) and operation over 250 hours. The system achieves sub-millimetre precision in 5-metre ambiguity ranges with a fundamental frep of 39.25 MHz and Delta frep of 869 Hz. The findings confirm the regime's robustness for high-precision ranging while exposing some limits. The thesis also analyses build-up and propagation dynamics in a single cavity, showing a two-stage process and how initial spike energy evolution affects successful separation. Finally, it offers mitigation strategies for LIDAR systems in harsh environments.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Dynamic Full-Field Optical Coherence Microscopy: Illuminating Intracellular Activity in Deep Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic full-field optical coherence microscopy (d-FF-OCM) is a label-free imaging technique that captures intrinsic subcellular motions to generate functional contrast. This dynamic approach yields images with fluorescence-like contrast, highlighting active structures without the need for fluorescent labels. However, current d-FF-OCM implementations struggle to image deep within highly scattering tissues at high resolution. Here, we present a new high-resolution d-FF-OCM system that overcomes these limitations, enabling much deeper high-resolution imaging in such tissues. The setup uses 100x oil-immersion objectives (NA = 1.25) and a high-brightness, laser-pumped incoherent white light source to achieve nanometer-scale resolution at depths up to approximately 100 micrometers in highly scattering samples. We also incorporate real-time reference arm adjustment to maintain signal strength and contrast as the focus moves deeper into the sample. Using this system, we imaged fresh ex vivo mouse liver and small intestine with unprecedented depth and detail. In these tissues, the dynamic contrast clearly revealed fine structures not visible with conventional OCT-for example, the sinusoidal microvasculature and organized cell layers in the liver, as well as neural plexuses and crypts in the intestine-all visualized label-free. By bridging the gap between high-resolution and deep imaging in highly scattering tissue, this advance provides a powerful new tool for biological microscopy, with potential applications from fundamental research to rapid intraoperative pathology.</description>

Abstract: By measuring a small circularly polarized component in the scattered light, we report the first observation of Rayleigh optical activity (RayOA) for typical chiral molecules, namely the two enantiomers of $\alpha$-pinene. Our work validates fundamental theoretical predictions made over fifty years ago and expands the chiroptical toolkit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Altermagnetic Magnons Probed by Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons with momentum-dependent chirality are a key signature of altermagnets. We identify bicircular light as a smoking-gun optical probe for chiral altermagnetic magnons, selectively targeting their quantum geometry induced by an alteration of magnonic chirality. We show that in $d$-wave altermagnets, under a canting magnetic field, the altermagnetic magnons realize a nontrivial quantum geometry, resulting in an enhancement of the nonlinear second-order light-magnon interactions. We find that the scattering of bicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the magnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman response as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons. As such, we propose a universal experimental protocol to distinguish altermagnets from antiferromagnets by detecting their magnon chirality patterns with light, independently of the underlying magnon topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous variable Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state is a resource for secure quantum communication and distributed quantum sensing. Here we present a technique for coherent control of the two-color EPR state generated by a frequency nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator. The scheme allows for robust control of the homodyne detection of each of the two EPR quantum fields separated by 200 nanometers. We apply our control scheme to stabilize and characterize a strong entangled state of two-color light displaying 9 dB of two-mode squeezing in the acoustic frequency range, making it a valuable tool for quantum networking and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a laser filament-induced plasma in air at 10 kHz using optical emission spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of high-power Yb-based ultrafast laser-amplifier systems has opened the possibility of air filamentation at high repetition rates &gt;1 kHz. In this new regime, accumulation effects cannot be ruled out, therefore, characterizing the plasma parameters and afterglow plasma-chemical kinetics becomes increasingly relevant. In this work, we use optical emission spectroscopy to measure nanosecond dynamics of gas temperature and electron temperature, species-specific decay times, and electron density of an atmospheric air laser filament produced by high average power femtosecond laser at a high repetition rate of 10 kHz. The molecular excitation mechanisms behind the nitrogen photoemissions are derived from vibrational distributions and temporal behavior of the studied emission bands. The presented diagnostic technique offers a complementary but more holistic measurement approach to optical probe schemes to characterize the laser-filament-induced plasma wake for high repetition rate filaments.</description>

Abstract: We present a scheme for generating stable and tunable entanglement between two localized Bloch domain walls in nanomagnetic strips kept inside a chiral optical cavity. The entanglement is mediated by the effective optomechanical interaction between the cavity photons and the two macroscopic, collective modes of the pinned domain walls. By controlling the pinning potential and optical driving frequency, the robust, steady-state entanglement between the two macroscopic domain walls can survive beyond the typical milli-Kelvin temperature range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable silicon phases have attracted extensive attention these years, due to their fundamentally distinct photoelectric properties compared to the conventional diamond cubic (I) counterpart. Certain metastable phases, prepared via thermal heating method, can exhibit direct bandgap characteristics, significantly enhancing their light absorbance and quantum efficiency. Herein, we tentatively demonstrate an all-silicon photodetector working from near- to mid-infrared bands through precisely selective laser annealing strategy. We systematically investigated the optical properties and optoelectronic response of III/XII mixture, IV phase, and III/XII-I homojunctions. The obtained results reveal that III/XII composite and IV phase exhibit negative and positive photoconductivity, respectively. Furthermore, the established laser heating approach facilitates us to fabricate all-silicon homostructures with tunable photoconductive properties, such as III/XII-I and IV-I junctions. These findings can expand the potential applications of metastable semiconducting materials in optoelectronics and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Normal Mode Splitting and Force Sensing in Cavity Magnomechanical System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of system composed of a single cavity consisting of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and a YIG sphere influenced by a bias magnetic field. This bias field leads to magnetostrictive effects on magnon modes that induces phonons. We investigate the position fluctuation spectrum and the output field spectrum, finding that at G =0, the system displays a single peak, indicative of weak coupling between the optical and phononic modes. As G increases (e.g., G =0.1 kappa_a, 0.2 kappa_a, 0.4 kappa_a, we observe a transition to double peak, which reflects stronger coupling in the vicinity of cavity along with phonon modes that leads to normal mode splitting (NMS) in cavity magnomechanic system. Furthermore, we examine that the OPA amplifies the Y quadrature while squeezing the X quadrature of the output field spectrum. This sensitive behavior results in a more pronounced splitting in the Y quadrature spectra compared to the X quadrature. Our findings emphasize the essential role of the OPA in adjusting the interaction strength between the optical and phononic modes as well as underscore the importance of quadrature analysis in characterizing the system's response. NMS mechanism open avenues for advanced applications in quantum sensing and information processing, highlighting the potential for tunable devices in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided hierarchical neural networks for Maxwell's equations in plasmonic metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) has found multiple applications in photonics, traditional "black box" ML models typically require prohibitively large training data sets. Generation of such data, as well as the training processes themselves, consume significant resources, often limiting practical applications of ML. Here we demonstrate that embedding Maxwell's equations into ML design and training significantly reduces the required amount of data and improves the physics-consistency and generalizability of ML models, opening the road to practical ML tools that do not need extremely large training sets. The proposed physics-guided machine learning (PGML) approach is illustrated on the example of predicting complex field distributions within hyperbolic metamaterial photonic funnels, based on multilayered plasmonic-dielectric composites. The hierarchical network design used in this study enables knowledge transfer and points to the emergence of effective medium theories within neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Optical computing systems deliver unrivalled processing speeds for scalar operations. Yet, integrated implementations have been constrained to low-dimensional tensor operations that fall short of the vector dimensions required for modern artificial intelligence. We demonstrate an all-optical neuromorphic computing system based on time division multiplexing, capable of processing input vectors exceeding 250,000 elements within a unified framework. The platform harnesses optically driven thermo-optic modulation in standing wave optical fields, with titanium nano-antennas functioning as wavelength-selective absorbers. Counterintuitively, the thermal time dynamics of the system enable simultaneous time integration of ultra-fast (50GHz) signals and the application of programmable, non-linear activation functions, entirely within the optical domain. This unified framework constitutes a leap towards large-scale photonic computing that satisfies the dimensional requirements of AI workloads.</description>

Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures enable efficient light-to-energy conversion by concentrating optical energy into nanoscale volumes. A key mechanism in this process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules. In this study, we investigate the relationship between CID and adsorbate-induced changes in DC electrical resistivity for four molecular adsorbates-adenine, 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), biphenyl thiol (BPT), and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID regimes. BPT causes CID via direct electronic transitions to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is centered at approx. 2 eV above the Fermi level and can be resonantly excited by the plasmon. This mechanism is dependent on plasmon energy. In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon damping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface. This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not involve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states. This same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity, suggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic energy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two effects. These findings provide new insights into the microscopic origins of plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Light Coupling Control in Ultrathin Photonic Nanomembranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic layer materials have emerged as essential building blocks for next generation quantum and semiconductor technologies, where atomic scale control over light matter interactions is critical. However, their inherently small optical interaction volume poses fundamental challenges for efficient integration into quantum and nanophotonic devices. Addressing this limitation requires the development of photonic platforms that can effectively enhance atomic-scale optical coupling. To this end, air suspended nanomembranes with extreme thinness and minimal radiative loss offer an ideal framework for integrating atomic layer materials into photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate an ultrathin freestanding photonic nanomembrane with a thickness down to 29 nm comparable to that of atomic layer materials enabling atomic scale control of light coupling. This architecture supports strong field confinement at the surface and significantly enhances light matter interaction. Through the integration of atomic layer material, we achieve angstrom level thickness modulation, where a single atomic-layer-deposition cycle corresponding to a thickness increment of 0.65 angstrom results in a 0.09 nm shift in the high Q resonance. High-resolution spatial mapping further confirms uniform and deterministic resonance tuning across the nanomembrane surface. This approach provides a scalable and versatile route for atomic-scale light coupling, effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional photonics and enabling progress in quantum photonics, 2D optoelectronics, and advanced semiconductor technologies.</description>

Abstract: Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong excitonic responses, direct bandgaps, and remarkable nonlinear optical properties, making them highly attractive for integrated photonic, optoelectronic, and quantum applications. Here, we present a large area freestanding membrane photonic platform that achieves exceptional enhancement of light matter interactions in monolayer WSe2 via quasi bound states in the continuum. The freestanding architecture effectively suppresses radiative losses and supports high Q optical resonances, leading to enhanced light matter interactions. This results in significant photoluminescence emission and second harmonic generation enhancement factors of 1158 and 378, respectively, with spatial uniformity sustained across a 450 times 450 um2 area. This uniform SHG enhancement further enables polarization resolved mapping of crystal orientation and grain boundaries, offering a practical method for large area structural characterization of 2D materials. Moreover, femtosecond pumped SHG spectra reveal multiple narrowband peaks originating from distinct quasi BIC modes providing direct spectral evidence of resonantly enhanced nonlinear coupling. The combined attributes of strong optical enhancement, spectral selectivity, and wafer scale compatibility establish this platform as a scalable interface for 2D semiconductor integration in next generation optoelectronic, nonlinear, and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

Abstract: We present a study of second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) in lithium triborate (LBO) crystals using a high-energy, 10-J-class, 10 Hz Yb:YAG laser system. We achieved high conversion efficiencies of 75% for SHG and 56% for THG for Gaussian-like temporal pulse shapes and top-hat-like beam profiles. The angular and temperature dependence of the LBO crystals were measured and validated through numerical simulations. The SHG process exhibited an angular acceptance bandwidth of 1.33 mrad and a temperature acceptance bandwidth of 2.61 K, while the THG process showed 1.19 mrad and 1.35 K, respectively. Additionally, long term stability measurements revealed RMS energy stabilities of 1.3% for SHG and 1.24% for THG. These results showcase the reliability of LBO crystals for high-energy, high-average-power harmonic generation. The developed system offers automated switching between harmonics provided at the system output. The system can be easily adapted to Nd:YAG based pump lasers as well.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>

Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image, underpinning diverse functionalities across all scales of matter-from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover two universal geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. These mechanisms operate effectively even in amorphous chiral media under isotropic illumination and persist at weak spin-orbit coupling, underscoring fundamental aspects of spin-chirality interplay. We further identify an unreported phenomenon central to CISS: locking of photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. Our findings provide a unified geometric framework with broad implications, extending from CISS and asymmetric catalysis to spin textures in chiral crystals and chiral quantum materials such as Weyl semimetals.</description>
