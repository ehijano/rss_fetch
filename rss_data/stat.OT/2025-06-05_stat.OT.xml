      <title>Pivoting the paradigm: the role of spreadsheets in K-12 data science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spreadsheet tools are widely accessible to and commonly used by K-12 students and teachers. They have an important role in data collection and organization. Beyond data organization, spreadsheets also make data visible and easy to interact with, facilitating student engagement in data exploration and analysis. Though not suitable for all circumstances, spreadsheets can and do help foster data and computing skills for K-12 students. This paper 1) reviews prior frameworks on K-12 data tools; 2) proposes data-driven learning outcomes that can be accomplished by incorporating spreadsheets into the curriculum; and 3) discusses how spreadsheets can help develop data acumen and computational fluency. We provide example class activities, identify challenges and barriers to adoption, suggest pedagogical approaches to ease the learning curve for instructors and students, and discuss the need for professional development to facilitate deeper use of spreadsheets for data science and STEM disciplines.</description>

      <title>Win Probabilities, Hand Sizes, and Game Duration Analysis in the Bhikar-Sawkar Card Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo simulation study of the Bhikar-Sawkar card game, a non-deterministic game structurally similar to the classic Beggar-My-Neighbour, which is fully deterministic. Although both games share a common setup, key differences in their rules, particularly the reshuffling of cards after each won hand in Bhikar-Sawkar, introduce stochasticity and significantly increase the space of possible game evolutions. This inherent randomness raises a range of interesting statistical questions regarding the duration of the game, the hand-winner distributions, and the probability of winning the game for a given player. These questions are systematically investigated through large-scale simulations across multiple game configurations.</description>
