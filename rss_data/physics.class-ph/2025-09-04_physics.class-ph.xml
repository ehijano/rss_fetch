      <title>Analysis of Three-Particle Elastic Collisions Using Newtonian Mechanics and Vector Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional elastic collisions of three point masses on a line under vacuum, with no triple collisions. We express momentum conservation in matrix form and analyze the composite map $D=D_{BC}D_{AB}$ and its powers $D^k$, which yield the velocities after any prescribed number of collisions for arbitrary mass ratios and initial data.
  After that, using vector $u$ on a plane $s^\perp$, the total number of collisions is \[ n\;=\;1+\Big\lfloor\tfrac{\Omega-\phi_{BC}}{\theta}\Big\rfloor+\Big\lceil\tfrac{\Omega-\phi_{BC}}{\theta}\Big\rceil, \] Through this concept, $D$ is recognised as giving $u$ a rotation with angle $\theta$ which is determined by only mass ratios. And, we calculated energy transfer through collisions. With the work, we find that the change of energy is proportional to total momentum of two particles and average velocity of particles based on initial average velocity of A and B before collision.</description>

      <title>Reply to "Comments on work of Yang and Nevels 'Direct, analytic solution for the electromagnetic vector potential in any gauge' (arXiv:2507.02104)" by Onoochin (arXiv:2507.08042)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of a difference between his and our results for the Coulomb-gauge vector potential, Onoochin (arXiv:2507.08042) suspected that we might have used some (so far unidentified) mathematically illegal operations in our paper (arXiv:2507.02104). In this note, we present four methods to prove the validity of our results in dispute. Onoochin's method for calculating his Coulomb-gauge vector potential is among our four methods used in the proofs.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of the classical Maxwell's equations in free space from the perspective of the correspondence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the advent of Quantum Mechanics' 100th anniversary, we wrote this review paper in order to present a discussion that addresses the foundations of this theory. And since the creation of this Mechanics and other quantum theories was guided by correspondence principles that needed to be identified between them and other well-established physical theories, this paper will be devoted to discussing the correspondence between these quantum theories and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. More precisely, what we will do throughout this paper is discuss how the Maxwell's electromagnetic theory in free space and the stronger formulation of the correspondence principle already pointed, together, to the basis of a Quantum Mechanics that was only be formulated half a century later. And, in order to make this very clear, we will show that the quantum-mechanical description of a photon can already be identified, simply, by manipulating Maxwell's equations in free space with mathematical resources that, for instance, were already well known before the advent of Quantum Mechanics.</description>
