      <title>Wall-crossing for zero-dimensional sheaves and Hilbert schemes of points on Calabi-Yau 4-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.01056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gross-Joyce-Tanaka arXiv:2005.05637 proposed a wall-crossing conjecture for Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Assuming it, we prove the conjecture of Cao-Kool arXiv:1712.07347 for 0-dimensional sheaf-counting invariants on projective Calabi-Yau 4-folds. From it, we extract the full topological information contained in the virtual fundamental classes of Hilbert schemes of points which turns out to be equivalent to the data of all descendent integrals. As a consequence, we can express many generating series of invariants in terms of explicit universal power series.
  i) On $\mathbb{C}^4$, Nekrasov proposed invariants with a conjectured closed form arXiv:1712.08128. We show that an analog of his formula holds for compact Calabi-Yau 4-folds satisfying the wall-crossing conjecture.
  ii) We notice a relationship to corresponding generating series for Quot schemes on elliptic surfaces which are also governed by a wall-crossing formula. This leads to a Segre-Verlinde correspondence for Calabi-Yau fourfolds.</description>

      <title>The definable content of homological invariants II: \v{C}ech cohomology and homotopy classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second installment in a series of papers applying descriptive set theoretic techniques to both analyze and enrich classical functors from homological algebra and algebraic topology. In it, we show that the \v{C}ech cohomology functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n$ on the category of locally compact separable metric spaces each factor into (i) what we term their definable version, a functor $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ taking values in the category $\mathsf{GPC}$ of groups with a Polish cover (a category first introduced in this work's predecessor), followed by (ii) a forgetful functor from $\mathsf{GPC}$ to the category of groups. These definable cohomology functors powerfully refine their classical counterparts: we show that they are complete invariants, for example, of the homotopy types of mapping telescopes of $d$-spheres or $d$-tori for any $d\geq 1$, and, in contrast, that there exist uncountable families of pairwise homotopy inequivalent mapping telescopes of either sort on which the classical cohomology functors are constant. We then apply the functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ to show that a seminal problem in the development of algebraic topology, namely Borsuk and Eilenberg's 1936 problem of classifying, up to homotopy, the maps from a solenoid complement $S^3\backslash\Sigma$ to the $2$-sphere, is essentially hyperfinite but not smooth.
  In the course of this work, we record Borel definable versions of a number of classical results bearing on both the combinatorial and homotopical formulations of \v{C}ech cohomology; in aggregate, this work may be regarded as laying foundations for the descriptive set theoretic study of the homotopy relation on the space of maps from a locally compact Polish space to a polyhedron, a relation which embodies a substantial variety of classification problems arising throughout mathematics.</description>
