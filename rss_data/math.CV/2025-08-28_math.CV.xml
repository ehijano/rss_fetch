      <title>K$\ddot{\operatorname{a}}$hlerity of invariant metrics on pseudoconvex domain of dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a two dimensional bounded pseudoconvex domain of finite type, we prove uniformization theorems via K$\ddot{\operatorname{a}}$hler-Kobayashi metric or K$\ddot{\operatorname{a}}$hler-Carath$\acute{\operatorname{e}}$odory metric with quasi-finite geometry of order three. In particular, a pseudoconvex Reinhardt domain of finite type is the unit ball if and only if the Bergman metric is a scalar multiple of the Kobayashi metric or Carath$\acute{\operatorname{e}}$odory metric. Moreover, we establish a rigidity theorem concerning holomorphic sectional curvature of Bergman metric and Lu constant.</description>

      <title>The Corona Problem for Slice Hyperholomorphic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Corona problem for slice hyperholomorphic functions for a single quaternionic variable. While the Corona problem is well-understood in the context of one complex variable, it remains highly challenging in the case of several complex variables. The extension of the theory of one complex variable to several complex variables is not the only possible extension to multi-dimensional complex analysis. Instead of functions holomorphic in each variable separately, in this paper we will consider functions in some hypercomplex algebras, in particular in the algebra of quaternions. Previously, the Corona problem had not been studied within the hypercomplex framework because of challenges posed by pointwise multiplication, which is not closed for hypercomplex-valued analytic functions. Alternative notions of multiplication that are closed often compromise other desirable properties, further complicating the analysis. In this work, we resolve the Corona problem within the quaternionic slice hyperholomorphic setting. Our approach involves reformulating the quaternionic Bezout equation with respect to the appropriate multiplication into a new system of Bezout equations on the unit disc. We solve this system by adapting Wolff's proof of the Corona theorem for bounded analytic functions. As the number of generators increases, the associated algebra grows increasingly intricate.</description>

      <title>Whitney Approximation: domains and bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate properties of holomorphic extensions in the one-variable case of Whitney's Approximation Theorem on intervals. Improving a result of Gauthier-Kienzle, we construct tangentially approximating functions which extend holomorphically to domains of optimal size. For approximands on unbounded closed intervals, we also bound the growth of holomorphic extensions, in the spirit of Arakelyan, Bernstein, Keldych, and Kober.</description>

      <title>On embedding theorems in analytic and harmonic function spaces of several variables in some domains in $C^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey we collect some recent advances concerning embedding theorems in analytic and harmonic function spaces of several variables in various domains in $C^n.$ Some sharp embedding results presented in this survey paper extend sharp embeddings in analytic function spaces obtained in higher dimension previously by J. Ortega, J. Fabrega, J. Cima, D. Luecking, M. Abate and many others in recent decades in the unit ball and bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains with the smooth boundary for onefunctional case to similar type analytic multyfunctional Bergman type function spaces. Same type multifunctional sharp extensions of some recent embedding results of one functional analytic function spaces of B. Sehba and D. Bekolle will be provided by us in this survey for unbounded domains namely for tubular domains over symmetric cones.In this paper we collect many new sharp embeddings in higher dimension obtained recently by first author though some one dimensional new sharp embeddings will be also mentioned shortly at the end of paper. Our results can be seen as direct sharp extensions of various sharp embedding theorems in analytic spaces in the unit disk obtained many years ago by L. Carleson, P. Duren, I. Verbitsky, D. Luecking and many others. Nice properties of so called $r$-lattices in various domains in $C^n$ are very important in all proofs of theorems of this paper.</description>

      <title>Equivariant scaling asymptotics for Poisson and Szeg\H{o} kernels on Grauert tube boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,\kappa)$ be a closed and connected real-analytic Riemannian manifold, acted upon by a compact Lie group of isometries $G$. We consider the following two kinds of equivariant asymptotics along a fixed Grauer tube boundary $X^\tau$ of $(M,\kappa)$.
  1): Given the induced unitary representation of $G$ on the eigenspaces of the Laplacian of $(M,\kappa)$, these split over the irreducible representations of $G$. On the other hand, the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian of $(M,\kappa)$ admit a simultaneous complexification to some Grauert tube. We study the asymptotic concentration along $X^\tau$ of the complexified eigenfunctions pertaining to a fixed isotypical component.
  2): There are furthermore an induced action of $G$ as a group of CR and contact automorphisms on $X^\tau$, and a corresponding unitary representation on the Hardy space $H(X^\tau)$. The action of $G$ on $X^\tau$ commutes with the homogeneous \lq geogesic flow\rq\, and the representation on the Hardy space commutes with the elliptic self-adjoint Toeplitz operator induced by the generator of the goedesic flow. Hence each eigenspace of the latter also splits over the irreducible representations of $G$. We study the asymptotic concentration of the eigenfunctions in a given isotypical component.
  We also give some applications of these asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On The Geometry and Topology of Cayley Condition in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the differential-geometric and topological properties of the Cayley condition in Poncelet porism for triangles, defined as the locus of pairs of non-degenerate conics that admit a Poncelet triangle. While the algebraic condition for this porism, established by Cayley, is classical, the geometric nature of the set of solutions has remained largely unexplored. We demonstrate that this Cayley set is a smooth, connected, 9-dimensional complex manifold. This is proven by showing it is an open subset of a smooth algebraic variety endowed with a trivial fiber bundle structure over the space of non-degenerate conics.
  To further analyze its structure, we construct the moduli space of transversely intersecting conic pairs under the action of $\mathbb{P}GL_3(\mathbb{C})$ and identify it with an open subset of $\mathbb{CP}^2/S_3$. We compute the fundamental group of a generic orbit.
  The elliptic j-invariant is then introduced as a holomorphic map on this space of conics, which factors through this moduli space. We analyze the subset of the Cayley set where this map is a submersion - its regular part - which corresponds to excluding points whose j-invariant is one of the critical values $0$ or $1728$. We prove that this regular part is the total space of a fiber bundle over $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0,1728\}$. This structure allows for the computation of the fundamental group via the long exact sequence of homotopy.
  Finally, we provide a principal bundle formulation for the Poncelet correspondence itself over orbits of conic pairs.</description>

      <title>Perfect t-embeddings of doubly periodic Aztec diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-scale geometry of t-surfaces -- pairs of perfect t-embeddings and their associated origami maps -- arising from dimer models on Aztec diamonds with periodic edge weights. We prove that these t-surfaces converge to space-like maximal surfaces in the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$. We observe that the frozen and gas regions influence the geometry of the limiting surface in striking ways: all frozen regions collapse to four boundary points, regardless of the number of frozen regions, while each gas region collapses to a distinct light-like cusp in the interior of the surface. In the absence of gas regions, the limiting surface lies entirely within $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$; in the general case, however, this is no longer true.
  The limiting surface is sensitive to the detailed structure of the model: both the positions of the cusps, and the placement of the boundary vertices, depend on the precise way the edge weights are distributed on the Aztec diamond. Nevertheless, we show that the global conformal structure remains robust and coincides with the Kenyon-Okounkov conformal structure. We further conjecture that the cusp locations encode the shift in the discrete Gaussian component that appears in the global fluctuations of the dimer model.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the deformations of compact K\"ahler hyperbolic manifolds. We propose slightly modified versions of K\"ahler hyperbolicity as a tool to provide a first step towards investigating the deformation openness of Gromov's classical notion of K\"ahler hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>On Banach subalgebras of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ consisting of lacunary Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ be the set of all Dirichlet series $f=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn^{-s}$ (where $a_n\in\mathbb{C}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\cdots\}$) that converge at each $s$ in $\mathbb{C}_0=\{s\in \mathbb{C}:\text{Re}(s)&gt;0\}$, such that $\|f\|_{\infty}=\sup_{s\in\mathbb{C}_0}|f(s)|&lt;\infty$. Then $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ is a Banach algebra with pointwise operations and the supremum norm $\|\cdot\|_\infty$, and has been studied in earlier works. The article introduces a new family of Banach subalgebras $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$. For $S\subset\mathbb{N}$, let $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ be the set of all elements $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn^{-s}\in \mathscr{H}^\infty$ such that for all $n\in \mathbb{N}\setminus S$, we have $a_n=0$. Then $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is a unital Banach subalgebra of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ with the supremum norm if and only if $S$ is a multiplicative subsemigroup of $\mathbb{N}$ containing $1$. It is shown that for such $S$, $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is the multiplier algebra of $\mathscr{H}^2_S$, where $\mathscr{H}^2_S$ is the Hilbert space of all Dirichlet series $f=\sum_{n\in S} a_nn^{-s}$ such that $\|f\|_2:=(\sum_{n\in S} |a_n|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;\infty$. A characterisation of the group of units in $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is also given, by showing an analogue of the Wiener $1/f$ theorem for $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$. If $S$ has a set of generators allowing a unique representation of each element of $S$, then it is shown that the Bass stable rank of $\mathscr{H}^\infty_S$ is infinite.</description>
