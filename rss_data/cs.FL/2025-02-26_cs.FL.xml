      <title>The Lottery LLM Hypothesis, Rethinking What Abilities Should LLM Compression Preserve?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model compression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from researchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Unstructured Data Quality via Updatable Extracted Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving data quality in unstructured documents is a long-standing challenge. Unstructured data, especially in textual form, inherently lacks defined semantics, which poses significant challenges for effective processing and for ensuring data quality. We propose leveraging information extraction algorithms to design, apply, and explain data cleaning processes for documents. Specifically, for a simple document update model, we identify and verify a set of sufficient conditions for rule-based extraction programs to qualify for inclusion in our document cleaning framework. Through experiments conducted on medical records, we demonstrate that our approach provides an effective framework for identifying and correcting data quality problems, thereby highlighting its practical value in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Mixing Any Cocktail with Limited Ingredients: On the Structure of Payoff Sets in Multi-Objective MDPs and its Impact on Randomised Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-dimensional payoff functions in Markov decision processes, and ask whether a given expected payoff vector can be achieved or not. In general, pure strategies (i.e., not resorting to randomisation) do not suffice for this problem.
  We study the structure of the set of expected payoff vectors of all strategies given a multi-dimensional payoff function and its consequences regarding randomisation requirements for strategies. In particular, we prove that for any payoff for which the expectation is well-defined under all strategies, it is sufficient to mix (i.e., randomly select a pure strategy at the start of a play and committing to it for the rest of the play) finitely many pure strategies to approximate any expected payoff vector up to any precision. Furthermore, for any payoff for which the expected payoff is finite under all strategies, any expected payoff can be obtained exactly by mixing finitely many strategies.</description>

      <title>Membership problems in nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study both the Submonoid Membership problem and the Rational Subset Membership problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups. We give two reductions with important applications. First, Submonoid Membership in any nilpotent group can be reduced to Rational Subset Membership in smaller groups. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a group with decidable Submonoid Membership and undecidable Rational Subset Membership, confirming a conjecture of Lohrey and Steinberg. Second, the Rational Subset Membership problem in $H_3(\mathbb Z)$ can be reduced to the Knapsack problem in the same group, and is therefore decidable. Combining both results, we deduce that the filiform $3$-step nilpotent group has decidable Submonoid Membership.</description>
