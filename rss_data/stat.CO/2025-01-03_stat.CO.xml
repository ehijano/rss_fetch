      <title>Polynomial time sampling from log-smooth distributions in fixed dimension under semi-log-concavity of the forward diffusion with application to strongly dissipative distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we provide a stochastic sampling algorithm with polynomial complexity in fixed dimension that leverages the recent advances on diffusion models where it is shown that under mild conditions, sampling can be achieved via an accurate estimation of intermediate scores across the marginals $(p_t)_{t\ge 0}$ of the standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process started at the density we wish to sample from. The heart of our method consists into approaching these scores via a computationally cheap estimator and relating the variance of this estimator to the smoothness properties of the forward process. Under the assumption that the density to sample from is $L$-log-smooth and that the forward process is semi-log-concave: $-\nabla^2 \log(p_t) \succeq -\beta I_d$ for some $\beta \geq 0$, we prove that our algorithm achieves an expected $\epsilon$ error in $\text{KL}$ divergence in $O(d^7L^{d+2}\epsilon^{-2(d+3)} (L+\beta)^2d^{2(d+1)})$ time. In particular, our result allows to fully transfer the problem of sampling from a log-smooth distribution into a regularity estimate problem. As an application, we derive an exponential complexity improvement for the problem of sampling from a $L$-log-smooth distribution that is $\alpha$-strongly log-concave distribution outside some ball of radius $R$: after proving that such distributions verify the semi-log-concavity assumption, a result which might be of independent interest, we recover a $poly(R,L,\alpha^{-1}, \epsilon^{-1})$ complexity in fixed dimension which exponentially improves upon the previously known $poly(e^{RL^2}, L,\alpha^{-1}, \log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ complexity in the low precision regime.</description>

      <title>Sampling the Bayesian Elastic Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bayesian elastic net regression model is characterized by the regression coefficient prior distribution, the negative log density of which corresponds to the elastic net penalty function. While Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods exist for sampling from the posterior of the regression coefficients given the penalty parameters, full Bayesian inference that incorporates uncertainty about the penalty parameters remains a challenge due to an intractable integrable in the posterior density function. Though sampling methods have been proposed that avoid computing this integral, all correctly-specified methods for full Bayesian inference that have appeared in the literature involve at least one "Metropolis-within-Gibbs" update, requiring tuning of proposal distributions. The computational landscape is complicated by the fact that two forms of the Bayesian elastic net prior have been introduced, and two representations (with and without data augmentation) of the prior suggest different MCMC algorithms. We review the forms and representations of the prior, discuss all combinations of these different treatments for the first time, and introduce one combination of form and representation that has yet to appear in the literature. We introduce MCMC algorithms for full Bayesian inference for all treatments of the prior. The algorithms allow for direct sampling of all parameters without any "Metropolis-within-Gibbs" steps. The key to the new approach is a careful transformation of the parameter space and an analysis of the resulting full conditional density functions that allows for efficient rejection sampling. We make empirical comparisons between our approaches and existing MCMC samplers for different data structures.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Outlier Detection Algorithm for Data Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of modern data is increasingly real-time, making outlier detection crucial in any data-related field, such as finance for fraud detection and healthcare for monitoring patient vitals. Traditional outlier detection methods, such as the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm, struggle with real-time data due to the need for extensive recalculations with each new data point, limiting their application in real-time environments. While the Incremental LOF (ILOF) algorithm has been developed to tackle the challenges of online anomaly detection, it remains computationally expensive when processing large streams of data points, and its detection performance may degrade after a certain threshold of points have streamed in. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of LOF algorithms for online anomaly detection, named the Efficient Incremental LOF (EILOF) algorithm. The EILOF algorithm only computes the LOF scores of new points without altering the LOF scores of existing data points. Although exact LOF scores have not yet been computed for the existing points in the new algorithm, datasets often contain noise, and minor deviations in LOF score calculations do not necessarily degrade detection performance. In fact, such deviations can sometimes enhance outlier detection. We systematically tested this approach on both simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating that EILOF outperforms ILOF as the volume of streaming data increases across various scenarios. The EILOF algorithm not only significantly reduces computational costs, but also systematically improves detection accuracy when the number of additional points increases compared to the ILOF algorithm.</description>

      <title>Adaptive posterior distributions for uncertainty analysis of covariance matrices in Bayesian inversion problems for multioutput signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of performing Bayesian inference for the parameters of a nonlinear multi-output model and the covariance matrix of the different output signals. We propose an adaptive importance sampling (AIS) scheme for multivariate Bayesian inversion problems, which is based in two main ideas: the variables of interest are split in two blocks and the inference takes advantage of known analytical optimization formulas. We estimate both the unknown parameters of the multivariate non-linear model and the covariance matrix of the noise. In the first part of the proposed inference scheme, a novel AIS technique called adaptive target adaptive importance sampling (ATAIS) is designed, which alternates iteratively between an IS technique over the parameters of the non-linear model and a frequentist approach for the covariance matrix of the noise. In the second part of the proposed inference scheme, a prior density over the covariance matrix is considered and the cloud of samples obtained by ATAIS are recycled and re-weighted to obtain a complete Bayesian study over the model parameters and covariance matrix. ATAIS is the main contribution of the work. Additionally, the inverted layered importance sampling (ILIS) is presented as a possible compelling algorithm (but based on a conceptually simpler idea). Different numerical examples show the benefits of the proposed approaches</description>

      <title>Fast data inversion for high-dimensional dynamical systems from noisy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a scalable approach for a flexible latent factor model for high-dimensional dynamical systems. Each latent factor process has its own correlation and variance parameters, and the orthogonal factor loading matrix can be either fixed or estimated. We utilize an orthogonal factor loading matrix that avoids computing the inversion of the posterior covariance matrix at each time of the Kalman filter, and derive closed-form expressions in an expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation, which substantially reduces the computational complexity without approximation. Our study is motivated by inversely estimating slow slip events from geodetic data, such as continuous GPS measurements. Extensive simulated studies illustrate higher accuracy and scalability of our approach compared to alternatives. By applying our method to geodetic measurements in the Cascadia region, our estimated slip better agrees with independently measured seismic data of tremor events. The substantial acceleration from our method enables the use of massive noisy data for geological hazard quantification and other applications.</description>

      <title>Deep P-Spline: Theory, Fast Tuning, and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied to solve real-world regression problems. However, selecting optimal network structures remains a significant challenge. This study addresses this issue by linking neuron selection in DNNs to knot placement in basis expansion techniques. We introduce a difference penalty that automates knot selection, thereby simplifying the complexities of neuron selection. We name this method Deep P-Spline (DPS). This approach extends the class of models considered in conventional DNN modeling and forms the basis for a latent variable modeling framework using the Expectation-Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm for efficient network structure tuning with theoretical guarantees. From a nonparametric regression perspective, DPS is proven to overcome the curse of dimensionality, enabling the effective handling of datasets with a large number of input variable, a scenario where conventional nonparametric regression methods typically underperform. This capability motivates the application of the proposed methodology to computer experiments and image data analyses, where the associated regression problems involving numerous inputs are common. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the model, underscoring its potential for advanced nonlinear regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Sampling Using Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Pseudo)random sampling, a costly yet widely used method in (probabilistic) machine learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, remains unfeasible on a truly large scale due to unmet computational requirements. We introduce an energy-efficient algorithm for uniform Float16 sampling, utilizing a room-temperature stochastic magnetic tunnel junction device to generate truly random floating-point numbers. By avoiding expensive symbolic computation and mapping physical phenomena directly to the statistical properties of the floating-point format and uniform distribution, our approach achieves a higher level of energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art Mersenne-Twister algorithm by a minimum factor of 9721 and an improvement factor of 5649 compared to the more energy-efficient PCG algorithm. Building on this sampling technique and hardware framework, we decompose arbitrary distributions into many non-overlapping approximative uniform distributions along with convolution and prior-likelihood operations, which allows us to sample from any 1D distribution without closed-form solutions. We provide measurements of the potential accumulated approximation errors, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Error estimation for quasi-Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling can attain far better accuracy than plain Monte Carlo sampling. However, with plain Monte Carlo sampling it is much easier to estimate the attained accuracy. This article describes methods old and new to quantify the error in quasi-Monte Carlo estimates. An important challenge in this setting is that the goal of getting accuracy conflicts with that of estimating the attained accuracy. A related challenge is that rigorous uncertainty quantifications can be extremely conservative. A recent surprise is that some RQMC estimates have nearly symmetric distributions and that has the potential to allow confidence intervals that do not require either a central limit theorem or a consistent variance estimate.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Metropolis-Hastings Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach for integrating score-based models with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. While traditional score-based diffusion models excel in accurately learning the score function from data points, they lack an energy function, making the Metropolis-Hastings adjustment step inaccessible. Consequently, the unadjusted Langevin algorithm is often used for sampling using estimated score functions. The lack of an energy function then prevents the application of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and other Metropolis-Hastings methods, limiting the wealth of other algorithms developed that use acceptance functions. We address this limitation by introducing a new loss function based on the \emph{detailed balance condition}, allowing the estimation of the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities given a learned score function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for various scenarios, including sampling from heavy-tail distributions.</description>

      <title>Improving Policy-Oriented Agent-Based Modeling with History Matching: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in computing power and data availability have led to growing sophistication in mechanistic mathematical models of social dynamics. Increasingly these models are used to inform real-world policy decision-making, often with significant time sensitivity. One such modeling approach is agent-based modeling, which offers particular strengths for capturing spatial and behavioral realism, and for in-silico experiments (varying input parameters and assumptions to explore their downstream impact on key outcomes). To be useful in the real world, these models must be able to qualitatively or quantitatively capture observed empirical phenomena, forming the starting point for subsequent experimentation. Computational constraints often form a significant hurdle to timely calibration and policy analysis in high resolution agent-based models. In this paper, we present a technical solution to address this bottleneck, substantially increasing efficiency and thus widening the range of utility for policy models. We illustrate our approach with a case study using a previously published and widely used epidemiological model.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov GAM Networks are all you need!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov GAM (K-GAM) networks are shown to be an efficient architecture for training and inference. They are an additive model with an embedding that is independent of the function of interest. They provide an alternative to the transformer architecture. They are the machine learning version of Kolmogorov's Superposition Theorem (KST) which provides an efficient representations of a multivariate function. Such representations have use in machine learning for encoding dictionaries (a.k.a. "look-up" tables). KST theory also provides a representation based on translates of the K\"oppen function. The goal of our paper is to interpret this representation in a machine learning context for applications in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our architecture is equivalent to a topological embedding which is independent of the function together with an additive layer that uses a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). This provides a class of learning procedures with far fewer parameters than current deep learning algorithms. Implementation can be parallelizable which makes our algorithms computationally attractive. To illustrate our methodology, we use the Iris data from statistical learning. We also show that our additive model with non-linear embedding provides an alternative to transformer architectures which from a statistical viewpoint are kernel smoothers. Additive KAN models therefore provide a natural alternative to transformers. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Fiducial inference for partially identified parameters with applications to instrumental variable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, there has been a fast-growing literature on fiducial inference since it was first proposed by R. A. Fisher in the 1930s. However, most of the fiducial inference based methods and related approaches have been developed for point-identified models, i.e., statistical models where the parameters of interest are uniquely determined by the observed data and the model's assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel fiducial approach for partially identified statistical models. As a leading example, we consider the instrumental variable model with a variety of causal assumptions and estimands. The proposed methods are illustrated through extensive simulations and a data analysis evaluating the effect of consuming Vitamin A supplementation on reducing mortality rates.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sampling for Generalized Linear Model under Measurement Constraint with Surrogate Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-constrained datasets, often encountered in semi-supervised learning, arise when data labeling is costly, time-intensive, or hindered by confidentiality or ethical concerns, resulting in a scarcity of labeled data. In certain cases, surrogate variables are accessible across the entire dataset and can serve as approximations to the true response variable; however, these surrogates often contain measurement errors and thus cannot be directly used for accurate prediction. We propose an optimal sampling strategy that effectively harnesses the available information from surrogate variables. This approach provides consistent estimators under the assumption of a generalized linear model, achieving theoretically lower asymptotic variance than existing optimal sampling algorithms that do not leverage surrogate data. By employing the A-optimality criterion from optimal experimental design, our strategy maximizes statistical efficiency. Numerical studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing optimal sampling methods, exhibiting reduced empirical mean squared error and enhanced robustness in algorithmic performance. These findings highlight the practical advantages of our strategy in scenarios where measurement constraints exist and surrogates are available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized estimating equation (GEE) method is a popular tool for longitudinal data analysis. However, GEE produces biased estimates when the outcome of interest is associated with cluster size, a phenomenon known as informative cluster size (ICS). In this study, we address this issue by formulating the impact of ICS and proposing an integrated approach to mitigate its effects. Our method combines the concept of within-cluster resampling with a penalized quasi-likelihood framework applied to each resampled dataset, ensuring consistency in model selection and estimation. To aggregate the estimators from the resampled datasets, we introduce a penalized mean regression technique, resulting in a final estimator that improves true positive discovery rates while reducing false positives. Simulation studies and an application to yeast cell-cycle gene expression data demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed penalized quasi-likelihood method via within-cluster resampling.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy sampling from constrained spaces with the Metropolis-adjusted Preconditioned Langevin Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a first-order sampling method called the Metropolis-adjusted Preconditioned Langevin Algorithm for approximate sampling from a target distribution whose support is a proper convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Our proposed method is the result of applying a Metropolis-Hastings filter to the Markov chain formed by a single step of the preconditioned Langevin algorithm with a metric $\mathscr{G}$, and is motivated by the natural gradient descent algorithm for optimisation. We derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the mixing time of this method for sampling from target distributions whose potentials are bounded relative to $\mathscr{G}$, and for exponential distributions restricted to the support. Our analysis suggests that if $\mathscr{G}$ satisfies stronger notions of self-concordance introduced in Kook and Vempala (2024), then these mixing time upper bounds have a strictly better dependence on the dimension than when is merely self-concordant. We also provide numerical experiments that demonstrates the practicality of our proposed method. Our method is a high-accuracy sampler due to the polylogarithmic dependence on the error tolerance in our mixing time upper bounds.</description>

      <title>A survey of Monte Carlo methods for noisy and costly densities with application to reinforcement learning and ABC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey gives an overview of Monte Carlo methodologies using surrogate models, for dealing with densities which are intractable, costly, and/or noisy. This type of problem can be found in numerous real-world scenarios, including stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning, where each evaluation of a density function may incur some computationally-expensive or even physical (real-world activity) cost, likely to give different results each time. The surrogate model does not incur this cost, but there are important trade-offs and considerations involved in the choice and design of such methodologies. We classify the different methodologies into three main classes and describe specific instances of algorithms under a unified notation. A modular scheme which encompasses the considered methods is also presented. A range of application scenarios is discussed, with special attention to the likelihood-free setting and reinforcement learning. Several numerical comparisons are also provided.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Long-Range Dependent Models with Missing Data: to Impute or not to Impute?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the most important models for long-range dependent time series is the class of ARFIMA$(p,d,q)$ (Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average) models. Estimating the long-range dependence parameter $d$ in ARFIMA models is a well-studied problem, but the literature regarding the estimation of $d$ in the presence of missing data is very sparse. There are two basic approaches to dealing with the problem: missing data can be imputed using some plausible method, and then the estimation can proceed as if no data were missing, or we can use a specially tailored methodology to estimate $d$ in the presence of missing data. In this work, we review some of the methods available for both approaches and compare them through a Monte Carlo simulation study. We present a comparison among 35 different setups to estimate $d$, under tenths of different scenarios, considering percentages of missing data ranging from as few as 10\% up to 70\% and several levels of dependence.</description>

      <title>Node classification in networks via simplicial interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the node classification task, it is natural to presume that densely connected nodes tend to exhibit similar attributes. Given this, it is crucial to first define what constitutes a dense connection and to develop a reliable mathematical tool for assessing node cohesiveness. In this paper, we propose a probability-based objective function for semi-supervised node classification that takes advantage of higher-order networks' capabilities. The proposed function reflects the philosophy aligned with the intuition behind classifying within higher order networks, as it is designed to reduce the likelihood of nodes interconnected through higher-order networks bearing different labels. Additionally, we propose the Stochastic Block Tensor Model (SBTM) as a graph generation model designed specifically to address a significant limitation of the traditional stochastic block model, which does not adequately represent the distribution of higher-order structures in real networks. We evaluate the objective function using networks generated by the SBTM, which include both balanced and imbalanced scenarios. Furthermore, we present an approach that integrates the objective function with graph neural network (GNN)-based semi-supervised node classification methodologies, aiming for additional performance gains. Our results demonstrate that in challenging classification scenarios--characterized by a low probability of homo-connections, a high probability of hetero-connections, and limited prior node information--models based on the higher-order network outperform pairwise interaction-based models. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that integrating our proposed objective function with existing GNN-based node classification approaches enhances classification performance by efficiently learning higher-order structures distributed in the network.</description>

      <title>Variational Pseudo Marginal Methods for Jet Reconstruction in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing jets, which provide vital insights into the properties and histories of subatomic particles produced in high-energy collisions, is a main problem in data analyses in collider physics. This intricate task deals with estimating the latent structure of a jet (binary tree) and involves parameters such as particle energy, momentum, and types. While Bayesian methods offer a natural approach for handling uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge, they face significant challenges due to the super-exponential growth of potential jet topologies as the number of observed particles increases. To address this, we introduce a Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo approach for inferring jet latent structures. As a second contribution, we leverage the resulting estimator to develop a variational inference algorithm for parameter learning. Building on this, we introduce a variational family using a pseudo-marginal framework for a fully Bayesian treatment of all variables, unifying the generative model with the inference process. We illustrate our method's effectiveness through experiments using data generated with a collider physics generative model, highlighting superior speed and accuracy across a range of tasks.</description>

      <title>Effects of the entropy source on Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how different sources of random numbers influence the outcomes of Monte Carlo simulations. We compare industry-standard pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to a quantum random number generator (QRNG) and show, using examples of Monte Carlo simulations with exact solutions, that the QRNG yields statistically significantly better approximations than the PRNGs. Our results demonstrate that higher accuracy can be achieved in the commonly known Monte Carlo method for approximating $\pi$. For Buffon's needle experiment, we further quantify a potential reduction in approximation errors by up to $1.89\times$ for optimal parameter choices when using a QRNG and a reduction of the sample size by $\sim 8\times$ for sub-optimal parameter choices. We attribute the observed higher accuracy to the underlying differences in the random sampling, where a uniformity analysis reveals a tendency of the QRNG to sample the solution space more homogeneously.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoders with latent high-dimensional steady geometric flows for dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10137v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which the latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our choosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture, frequently reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) error between 15% to 35% on select datasets. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times. We provide empirical justification towards how we can improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.</description>

      <title>Summarizing Bayesian Nonparametric Mixture Posterior -- Sliced Optimal Transport Metrics for Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods to summarize posterior inference for mixture models focus on identifying a point estimate of the implied random partition for clustering, with density estimation as a secondary goal (Wade and Ghahramani, 2018; Dahl et al., 2022). We propose a novel approach for summarizing posterior inference in nonparametric Bayesian mixture models, prioritizing density estimation of the mixing measure (or mixture) as an inference target. One of the key features is the model-agnostic nature of the approach, which remains valid under arbitrarily complex dependence structures in the underlying sampling model. Using a decision-theoretic framework, our method identifies a point estimate by minimizing posterior expected loss. A loss function is defined as a discrepancy between mixing measures. Estimating the mixing measure implies inference on the mixture density and the random partition. Exploiting the discrete nature of the mixing measure, we use a version of sliced Wasserstein distance. We introduce two specific variants for Gaussian mixtures. The first, mixed sliced Wasserstein, applies generalized geodesic projections on the product of the Euclidean space and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. The second, sliced mixture Wasserstein, leverages the linearity of Gaussian mixture measures for efficient projection.</description>
