      <title>Energy-ordered resource stratification as an agnostic signature of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life hinges on identifying biosignatures, often focusing on gaseous metabolic byproducts as indicators. However, most such biosignatures require assuming specific metabolic processes. It is widely recognized that life on other planets may not resemble that of Earth, but identifying biosignatures ``agnostic'' to such assumptions has remained a challenge. Here, we propose a novel approach by considering the generic outcome of life: the formation of competing ecosystems. We use a minimal model to argue that the presence of ecosystem-level dynamics, characterized by ecological interactions and resource competition, may yield biosignatures independent of specific metabolic activities. Specifically, we propose the emergent stratification of chemical resources in order of decreasing energy content as a candidate new biosignature. While likely inaccessible to remote sensing, this signature could be relevant for sample return missions, or for detection of ancient signatures of life on Earth itself.</description>

      <title>Predicting species occurrence patterns from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the interlinked biodiversity and climate crises, we need an understanding of where species occur and how these patterns are changing. However, observational data on most species remains very limited, and the amount of data available varies greatly between taxonomic groups. We introduce the problem of predicting species occurrence patterns given (a) satellite imagery, and (b) known information on the occurrence of other species. To evaluate algorithms on this task, we introduce SatButterfly, a dataset of satellite images, environmental data and observational data for butterflies, which is designed to pair with the existing SatBird dataset of bird observational data. To address this task, we propose a general model, R-Tran, for predicting species occurrence patterns that enables the use of partial observational data wherever found. We find that R-Tran outperforms other methods in predicting species encounter rates with partial information both within a taxon (birds) and across taxa (birds and butterflies). Our approach opens new perspectives to leveraging insights from species with abundant data to other species with scarce data, by modelling the ecosystems in which they co-occur.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Treatment of Animal Movement Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional track of an animal on a landscape has progressed over the past three decades from hourly to second-by-second recordings of locations. Track segmentation methods for analyzing the behavioral information in such relocation data has lagged somewhat behind, with scales of analysis currently at the sub-hourly to minute level. A new approach is needed to bring segmentation analysis down to a second-by-second level. Here, such an approach is presented that rests heavily on concepts from Shannon's Information Theory. In this paper, we first briefly review and update concepts relating to movement path segmentation. We then discuss how cluster analysis can be used to organize the smallest viable statistical movement elements (StaMEs), which are $\mu$ steps long, and to code the next level of movement elements called ``words'' that are $m \mu$ steps long. Centroids of these word clusters are identified as canonical activity modes (CAMs). Unlike current segmentation schemes, the approach presented here allows us to provide entropy measures for movement paths, compute the coding efficiencies of derived StaMEs and CAMs, and assess error rates in the allocation of strings of $m$ StaMEs to CAM types. In addition our approach allows us to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure to assess and compare the best choices for the various parameters (number of steps in a StaME, number of StaME types, number of StaMEs in a word, number of CAM types), as well as the best clustering methods for generating segments that can then be used to interpret and predict sequences of higher order segments. The theory presented here provides another tool in our toolbox for dealing with the effects of global change on the movement and redistribution of animals across altered landscapes</description>
