      <title>Predator and Prey: A Minimum Recipe for the Transition from Steady to Oscillating Precipitation in Hothouse Climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present tropical atmosphere, precipitation typically exhibits noisy, small-amplitude fluctuations about an average. However, recent cloud-resolving simulations show that in a hothouse climate, precipitation can shift to a regime characterized by nonlinear oscillations. In this regime, intense precipitation events are separated by several dry days. This raises questions about what triggers the shift from a quasi-equilibrium state of precipitation to nonlinear precipitation oscillations and what factors determine the characteristics of these oscillations. To address these questions, we present a low-order model that includes two nonlinear ordinary differential equations, one for precipitation and the other for convective inhibition (CIN). Three processes govern the development of precipitation: a convective trigger that enhances precipitation, a self-limiting mechanism that reduces intense precipitation, and the effect of CIN in suppressing precipitation. On the other hand, CIN increases due to compensating subsidence from convection and decays exponentially over time due to radiation. A critical parameter in our model is the time-mean CIN (CIN*). As CIN* gradually increases, precipitation transitions from a quasi-equilibrium state to a nonlinear oscillation via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. In the high CIN* limit, our model reduces to predator-prey dynamics, with CIN as the predator and precipitation as the prey. Here, the nonlinear oscillation's amplitude (maximum precipitation) grows with CIN*, and its period increases with the oscillation amplitude. A suite of cloud-resolving simulations corroborates these predictions from our low-order model, highlighting the effect of convective triggering and inhibition in regulating precipitation variability.</description>

      <title>Impact of changing the wet deposition schemes in ldx on 137-cs atmosperic deposits after the fukushima accident</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fukushima-Daiichi release of radioactivity is a relevant event to study the atmospheric dispersion modelling of radionuclides. Actually, the atmospheric deposition onto the ground may be studied through the map of measured Cs-137 established consecutively to the accident. The limits of detection were low enough to make the measurements possible as far as 250km from the nuclear power plant. This large scale deposition has been modelled with the Eulerian model ldX. However, several weeks of emissions in multiple weather conditions make it a real challenge. Besides, these measurements are accumulated deposition of Cs-137 over the whole period and do not inform of deposition mechanisms involved: in-cloud, below-cloud, dry deposition. In a previous study (Qu{\'e}rel et al., 2016), a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed in order to understand wet deposition mechanisms. It has been shown that the choice of the wet deposition scheme has a strong impact on assessment of deposition patterns. Nevertheless, a ``best'' scheme could not be highlighted as it depends on the selected criteria: the ranking differs according to the statistical indicators considered (correlation, figure of merit in space and factor 2). A possibility to explain the difficulty to discriminate between several schemes was the uncertainties in the modelling, resulting from the meteorological data for instance. Since the move of the plume is not properly modelled, the deposition processes are applied with an inaccurate activity concentration in the air. In the framework of the SAKURA project, an MRI-IRSN collaboration, new meteorological fields at higher resolution (Sekiyama et al., 2013) were provided and allow to reconsider the previous study. An update including these new meteorology data is presented. In addition, the focus is put on the deposition schemes commonly used in nuclear emergency context.</description>

      <title>Changes in anthropogenic aerosols during the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns in the context of long-term historical trends at 51 AERONET stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-consensus has steadily formed in the scientific literature on the fact that the prevention measures implemented by most countries to curb the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to significant reductions in pollution levels around the world, especially in urban environments. Fewer studies have looked at the how these reductions at ground level translate into variations in the whole atmosphere. In this study, we examine the columnar values of aerosols at 51 mainland European stations of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). We show that when considered in the context of the long-term trend over the last decade, the columnar aerosol levels for 2020, at the regional level, do not appear exceptional. Both the yearly means and the number of episodes with extreme values for this period are within the one standard deviation of the long-term trends. We conclude that the spatially and temporally very localized reductions do not add up to statistically significant reductions in the global levels of aerosols. Furthermore, considering that pandemic lockdowns can be thought of as a simulation of a climate change mitigation scenario, we conclude that such lifestyle-based changes present a very low potential as a global climate change mitigation strategy.</description>

      <title>Rapid Statistical-Physical Adversarial Downscaling Reveals Bangladesh's Rising Rainfall Risk in a Warming Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bangladesh, a nation vulnerable to climate change, accurately quantifying the risk of extreme weather events is crucial for planning effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. Downscaling coarse climate model projections to finer resolutions is key in improving risk and uncertainty assessments. This work develops a new approach to rainfall downscaling by integrating statistics, physics, and machine learning and applies it to assess Bangladesh's extreme rainfall risk. Our method successfully captures the observed spatial pattern and risks associated with extreme rainfall in the present climate. It also produces uncertainty estimates by rapidly downscaling multiple models in a future climate scenario(s). Our analysis reveals that the risk of extreme rainfall is projected to increase throughout Bangladesh mid-century, with the highest risk in the northeast. The daily maximum rainfall at a 100-year return period is expected to rise by approximately 50 mm per day. However, using multiple climate models also indicates considerable uncertainty in the projected risk.</description>

      <title>DABench: A Benchmark Dataset for Data-Driven Weather Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have led to the development of several Large Weather Models (LWMs) that rival state-of-the-art (SOTA) numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Up to now, these models still rely on traditional NWP-generated analysis fields as input and are far from being an autonomous system. While researchers are exploring data-driven data assimilation (DA) models to generate accurate initial fields for LWMs, the lack of a standard benchmark impedes the fair evaluation among different data-driven DA algorithms. Here, we introduce DABench, a benchmark dataset utilizing ERA5 data as ground truth to guide the development of end-to-end data-driven weather prediction systems. DABench contributes four standard features: (1) sparse and noisy simulated observations under the guidance of the observing system simulation experiment method; (2) a skillful pre-trained weather prediction model to generate background fields while fairly evaluating the impact of assimilation outcomes on predictions; (3) standardized evaluation metrics for model comparison; (4) a strong baseline called the DA Transformer (DaT). DaT integrates the four-dimensional variational DA prior knowledge into the Transformer model and outperforms the SOTA in physical state reconstruction, named 4DVarNet. Furthermore, we exemplify the development of an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system by integrating DaT with the prediction model. Researchers can leverage DABench to develop their models and compare performance against established baselines, which will benefit the future advancements of data-driven weather prediction systems. The code is available on this Github repository and the dataset is available at the Baidu Drive.</description>
