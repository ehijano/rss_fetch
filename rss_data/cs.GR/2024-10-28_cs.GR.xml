      <title>Progressive Glimmer: Expanding Dimensionality in Multidimensional Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progressive dimensionality reduction algorithms allow for visually investigating intermediate results, especially for large data sets. While different algorithms exist that progressively increase the number of data points, we propose an algorithm that allows for increasing the number of dimensions. Especially in spatio-temporal data, where each spatial location can be seen as one data point and each time step as one dimension, the data is often stored in a format that supports quick access to the individual dimensions of all points. Therefore, we propose Progressive Glimmer, a progressive multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm. We adapt the Glimmer algorithm to support progressive updates for changes in the data's dimensionality. We evaluate Progressive Glimmer's embedding quality and runtime. We observe that the algorithm provides more stable results, leading to visually consistent results for progressive rendering and making the approach applicable to streaming data. We show the applicability of our approach to spatio-temporal simulation ensemble data where we add the individual ensemble members progressively.</description>

      <title>Practical High-Contrast Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic displays are a promising technology for immersive visual experiences, and their potential for compact form factor makes them a strong candidate for head-mounted displays. However, at the short propagation distances needed for a compact, head-mounted architecture, image contrast is low when using a traditional phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM). Although a complex SLM could restore contrast, these modulators require bulky lenses to optically co-locate the amplitude and phase components, making them poorly suited for a compact head-mounted design. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture to improve contrast: by adding a low resolution amplitude SLM a short distance away from the phase modulator, we demonstrate peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement up to 31 dB in simulation compared to phase-only, even when the amplitude modulator is 60$\times$ lower resolution than its phase counterpart. We analyze the relationship between diffraction angle and amplitude modulator pixel size, and validate the concept with a benchtop experimental prototype. By showing that low resolution modulation is sufficient to improve contrast, we pave the way towards practical high-contrast holography in a compact form factor.</description>

      <title>Block and Detail: Scaffolding Sketch-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel sketch-to-image tool that aligns with the iterative refinement process of artists. Our tool lets users sketch blocking strokes to coarsely represent the placement and form of objects and detail strokes to refine their shape and silhouettes. We develop a two-pass algorithm for generating high-fidelity images from such sketches at any point in the iterative process. In the first pass we use a ControlNet to generate an image that strictly follows all the strokes (blocking and detail) and in the second pass we add variation by renoising regions surrounding blocking strokes. We also present a dataset generation scheme that, when used to train a ControlNet architecture, allows regions that do not contain strokes to be interpreted as not-yet-specified regions rather than empty space. We show that this partial-sketch-aware ControlNet can generate coherent elements from partial sketches that only contain a small number of strokes. The high-fidelity images produced by our approach serve as scaffolds that can help the user adjust the shape and proportions of objects or add additional elements to the composition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a variety of examples and evaluative comparisons. Quantitatively, evaluative user feedback indicates that novice viewers prefer the quality of images from our algorithm over a baseline Scribble ControlNet for 84% of the pairs and found our images had less distortion in 81% of the pairs.</description>

      <title>Jump Restore Light Transport</title>

Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms come to rescue when sampling from a complex, high-dimensional distribution by a conventional method is intractable. Even though MCMC is a powerful tool, it is also hard to control and tune in practice. Simultaneously achieving both local exploration of the state space and global discovery of the target distribution is a challenging task. In this work, we present a MCMC formulation that subsumes all existing MCMC samplers employed in rendering. We then present a novel framework for adjusting an arbitrary Markov chain, making it exhibit invariance with respect to a specified target distribution. To showcase the potential of the proposed framework, we focus on a first simple application in light transport simulation. As a by-product, we introduce continuous-time MCMC sampling to the computer graphics community. We show how any existing MCMC-based light transport algorithm can be embedded into our framework. We empirically and theoretically prove that this embedding is superior to running the standalone algorithm. In fact, our approach will convert any existing algorithm into a highly parallelizable variant with shorter running time, smaller error and less variance.</description>

      <title>Edge-preserving noise for diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that is a generalization of denoising diffusion probablistic models (DDPM). In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results showing consistent improvements (FID score) of up to 30% for both tasks.
