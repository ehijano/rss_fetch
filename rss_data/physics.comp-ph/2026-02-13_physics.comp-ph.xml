      <title>Stochastic Point Kinetics Model of Circulating-Fuel Reactors under Perfect Mixing Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stochastic framework for low-population dynamics in circulating-fuel reactors (CFRs) that captures delayed-neutron precursor (DNP) transport without delay terms. Starting from a modified point-kinetics model with two perfectly-mixed volumes, we derive equivalent discrete-event dynamics and an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. Two solvers are implemented: an analog Monte Carlo (AMC) engine and a semi-implicit Milstein SDE solver. Transient benchmarks demonstrate perfect agreement of AMC/SDE means with deterministic solutions, while revealing that the SDE approach underestimates DNP variances in selected regimes, potentially due to the neglect of DNP noise. We further recast reactivity loss due to precursor drift in this stochastic setting and show that its estimator is negatively biased. Overall, the developed framework provides a minimal yet representative model for CFR low-population kinetics. Future work will re-derive and test SDE noise terms and apply the framework to selected transient applications such as start-up analyses of CFRs.</description>

      <title>Addressing the ground state of the deuteron by physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have proven to be effective in addressing the structure of atomic nuclei. Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a promising machine learning technique suitable for solving integro-differential problems such as the many-body Schr\"odinger problem. So far, there has been no demonstration of extracting nuclear eigenstates using such method. Here, we tackle realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction in momentum space, including models with strong high-momentum correlations, and demonstrate highly accurate results for the deuteron. We further provide additional benchmarks in coordinate space. We introduce an expression for the variational energy that enters the loss function, which can be evaluated efficiently within the PINNs framework. Results are in excellent agreement with proven numerical methods, with a relative error between the value of the predicted binding energy by the PINN and the numerical benchmark of the order of $10^{-6}$. Our approach paves the way for the exploitation of PINNs to solve more complex atomic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Fast 3D Porous Media Generation: a GPU- Accelerated List-Indexed Explicit Time-Stepping QSGS Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient generation of high-resolution synthetic microstructures is essential in digital rock physics, yet classical Quartet Structure Generation Set (QSGS) algorithms become prohibitively expensive on large three-dimensional grids. We develop a list-indexed explicit time-stepping (LIETS) formulation of QSGS that restricts stochastic growth operations to an explicit active front instead of the entire voxel grid. The method is implemented in Python using NumPy on CPUs and CuPy on GPUs, and incorporates seed-spacing control via diamond dilation together with a volume-fraction-dependent directional growth probability. For a 400^3 domain, LIETS reduces generation time from tens of minutes for a serial CPU implementation and several minutes for vectorized CPU and GPU QSGS to about 24 s on a consumer-grade RTX 4060, achieving peak throughputs up to 2.7x10^7 nodes/s. A Fontainebleau sandstone benchmark at 500^3 resolution shows that LIETS reproduces the dependence of pore and grain size distributions on seed spacing (optimal s=30 voxels) and yields permeability-porosity trends within the experimental envelope and consistent with previously published Fast-QSGS results.</description>

      <title>On Capturing Laminar/Turbulent Regions Over a Wing Using WMLES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is performed for flow over a wing with a focus on documenting grid resolution requirements to predict both the laminar and turbulent regions accurately. Flow over a spanwise extruded NACA0012 airfoil at 0-degree angle of attack and freestream chord-based Reynolds numbers of 3 million is simulated using an unstructured-grid finite-volume solver. An equilibrium wall function with the first off-wall grid point as the exchange location is used. Two scenarios are simulated wherein either the entire airfoil surface, or only a portion of it, is assumed turbulent based on linear stability calculations. For the latter scenario, the regular no-slip wall boundary condition is imposed in laminar regions. Using the same grid that was employed in the fully turbulent case, WMLES captured the skin friction in the turbulent region close to the RANS results. However, the skin friction is not well captured in the laminar region, due to far few grid points inside the boundary layer. When the near-wall grid was refined in the wall normal direction, the laminar region was captured accurately, but the turbulent region was not resolved well because the first off-wall point moved below the buffer-layer. To reconcile differing resolution requirements in the laminar and turbulent regions, a grid was generated based on the varying boundary layer thickness estimated from a precursor RANS simulation with a specified transition location. This grid produced improved results in the laminar region but resulted in a delayed transition location. Unsteady disturbances with the most amplified frequencies were introduced upstream of the neutral point. The transition process in the laminar region and the skin friction in the turbulent region were then captured satisfactorily.</description>

      <title>Toward Adaptive Non-Intrusive Reduced-Order Models: Design and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are often deployed as static surrogates, which limits their practical utility once a system leaves the training manifold. We formalize and study adaptive non-intrusive ROMs that update both the latent subspace and the reduced dynamics online. Building on ideas from static non-intrusive ROMs, specifically, Operator Inference (OpInf) and the recently-introduced Non-intrusive Trajectory-based optimization of Reduced-Order Models (NiTROM), we propose three formulations: Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and a hybrid that initializes NiTROM with an OpInf update. We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries. This work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as the dynamics evolve well beyond the initial manifold.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Thermal Equilibrium Stages in Molecular Dynamics Simulations of two Bodies in Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third one, then they are also in equilibrium with each other. This study explores not only the final state of thermal equilibrium between ideal gases separated by heat-conducting walls, but also the intermediate stages leading up to equilibrium, using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Two- and three-region models with argon atoms are analyzed. Fluctuations, correlations, and temperature distributions are observed, highlighting how heat conduction between regions influences the time to reach equilibrium. This work is distinguished by its detailed analysis of the intermediate stages that occur until the system reaches thermal equilibrium, in accordance with the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>ArGEnT: Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer for Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries and parametric physical settings is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. In many-query regimes such as design optimization, control and inverse problems, surrogate modeling must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations. In this work, we propose Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT), a geometry-aware attention-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains. ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features. By integrating ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, we develop a surrogate modeling framework capable of learning operator mappings that depend on both geometric and non-geometric inputs without the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input. Evaluation on benchmark problems spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electrochemical systems, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared with the standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware saurrogates. In particular, the cross-attention transformer variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions. By combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems.</description>

      <title>A critical assessment of bonding descriptors for predicting materials properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most machine learning models for materials science rely on descriptors based on materials compositions and structures, even though the chemical bond has been proven to be a valuable concept for predicting materials properties. Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials. The results demonstrate that incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors not only improves predictive performance but also helps identify intuitive expressions for properties such as the projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer for Multi-Domain Phase Retrieval in Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes rapidly difficult in the strong-phase regime, where a crystal contains distortions beyond half a lattice spacing. An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\pm \pi/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\mathrm{Ca}_x\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($\chi^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $\chi^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$\chi^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline.</description>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve physical systems by incorporating governing partial differential equations directly into neural network training. In electromagnetism, where well-established methodologies such as FDTD and FEM already exist, new methodologies are expected to provide clear advantages to be accepted. Despite their mesh-free nature and applicability to inverse problems, PINNs can exhibit deficiencies in accuracy and energy metrics compared to FDTD. This study demonstrates that hybrid training strategies can bring PINNs closer to FDTD-level accuracy and energy consistency. A hybrid methodology addressing common challenges in wave propagation is presented. Causality collapse in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. To mitigate discontinuities introduced by time marching, a two stage interface continuity loss is applied. To suppress cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer is developed. In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09% NRMSE and 1.01% $L^2$ error over time. Energy conservation is achieved with only a 0.02% relative energy mismatch in the 2D PEC cavity scenario. Training is performed without labeled field data, using only physics-based residual losses; FDTD is used solely for post-training evaluation. The results demonstrate that PINNs can achieve competitive results with FDTD in canonical electromagnetic examples and are a viable alternative.</description>

      <title>Edge-of-chaos enhanced quantum-inspired algorithm for combinatorial optimization</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility for physics-inspired approaches to combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>DRIFT-Net: A Spectral--Coupled Neural Operator for PDEs Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers. In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in Poseidon serving as a representative example. However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose DRIFT-Net. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of this design. The code is available at https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/DRIFT-Net.</description>

      <title>An open-source computational framework for immersed fluid-structure interaction modeling using FEBio and MFEM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation of biological systems presents significant computational challenges, particularly for applications involving large structural deformations and contact mechanics, such as heart valve dynamics. Traditional ALE methods encounter fundamental difficulties with such problems due to mesh distortion, motivating immersed techniques. This work presents a novel open-source immersed FSI framework that strategically couples two mature finite element libraries: MFEM, a GPU-ready and scalable library with state-of-the-art parallel performance developed at LLNL, and FEBio, a nonlinear finite element solver with sophisticated solid mechanics capabilities designed for biomechanics applications developed at the University of Utah and Columbia University. This coupling creates a unique synergy wherein the fluid solver leverages MFEM's distributed-memory parallelization and pathway to GPU acceleration, while the immersed solid exploits FEBio's comprehensive suite of hyperelastic and viscoelastic constitutive models and advanced solid mechanics modeling targeted for biomechanics applications. FSI coupling is achieved using a fictitious domain methodology with variational multiscale stabilization for enhanced accuracy on under-resolved grids expected with unfitted meshes used in immersed FSI. A fully implicit, monolithic scheme provides robust coupling for strongly coupled FSI characteristic of cardiovascular applications. The framework's modular architecture facilitates straightforward extension to additional physics and element technologies. Several test problems are considered to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, including a 3D semilunar heart valve simulation. This platform addresses a critical need for open-source immersed FSI software combining advanced biomechanics modeling with high-performance computing infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: Modal methods are a long-standing approach to physical modelling synthesis. Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, leading to coupled nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such systems. On the other hand, neural ordinary differential equations have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of the system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture. Compared to our previous work that used multilayer perceptrons to parametrise nonlinear dynamics, we employ gradient networks that allow an interpretation in terms of a closed-form and non-negative potential required by scalar auxiliary variable techniques. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for the nonlinear transverse vibration of a string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.</description>
