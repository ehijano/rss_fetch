      <title>Policy, Risk, and Norms Shape Collective Behaviors Worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Societal responses to environmental change vary widely, even under comparable shocks, reflecting differences in both policy measures and public reactions shaped by cultural and socioeconomic contexts. We examine mask-wearing dynamics across 47 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic using a process-based, utility-driven model of individual behavior with three evolving drivers: policy stringency, disease risk, and social norms to understand emergent collective behavior. Calibrated with daily data on mask usage, COVID-19 deaths, and policy mandates, the model reproduces diverse national trajectories with minimal complexity. Differences in the decision weights assigned to policy and norms are critical for explaining variation, while risk and policy weights correlate with cultural and socioeconomic indicators. Norm weights, by contrast, are distributed more evenly across contexts. Our findings demonstrate how mechanistic models can uncover the processes shaping collective behavior, enabling policymakers to anticipate the magnitude and timing of behavioral change and design more effective, context-sensitive interventions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven pattern formation in an opinion dynamical network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial organization of individuals and their interactions in communities are important factors known to preserve diversity in many complex systems. Inspired by metapopulation models from ecology, we study opinion formation using a network-based approach in which nodes represent communities of interacting agents holding one of two competing opinions, and links represent avenues of migration. Agents adapt to the dominant opinion within a community or migrate toward communities with similar views. Using a master stability function approach, we analytically derive conditions for diffusion-driven pattern formation and identify structural features of the community network that sustain opinion diversity. Our model shows that even under minimal opinion rules, the interaction between local dynamics and community structure generates spatial patterns that allow minority opinions to persist by gaining local dominance.</description>

      <title>Higher-order network adaptivity: co-evolution of higher-order structure and spreading dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The co-evolution of structure and dynamics, known as adaptivity, is a fundamental property in various systems and drives diverse emergent behaviors. However, the adaptivity in previous works is primarily stemmed from pairwise situations, while is insufficient to capture ubiquitous higher-order characteristics of real systems. Here, we introduce higher-order network adaptivity to model the co-evolution of higher-order structure and spreading dynamics, and theoretically analyze the thresholds and spreading sizes. Results demonstrate that both pairwise-like and higher-order adaptivity consistently increase spreading thresholds, but surprisingly produce completely opposing qualitative effects. Specifically, contrary to pairwise-like adaptivity, higher-order adaptivity not only reduces or even eliminates the bistable region, but also leads to shifts of phase transitions from discontinuous to continuous. These findings are validated on both synthetic and real hypergraphs. Our work introduces an idea of higher-order adaptivity and highlights its fundamental differences from pairwise-like adaptivity, advancing further researches of adaptive higher-order systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial Super-Infection and Co-Infection Dynamics in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interactions between the spread of multiple pathogens during an epidemic is crucial to assessing the severity of infections in human communities. In this paper, we introduce two new Multiplex Bi-Virus Reaction-Diffusion models (MBRD) on multiplex metapopulation networks: the super-infection model (MBRD-SI) and the co-infection model (MBRD-CI). These frameworks capture two-pathogen dynamics with spatial diffusion and cross-diffusion, allowing the prediction of infection clustering and large-scale spatial distributions. We establish conditions for Turing and Turing-Hopf instabilities in both models and provide experimental evidence of epidemic pattern formation. Beyond epidemiology, we discuss applications of the MBRD framework to information propagation, malware diffusion, and urban transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Graph topology estimation of power grids using pairwise mutual information of time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</description>

      <title>Ordering-disordering dynamics of the $q$-voter model under random external bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a variant of the two-state $q$-voter model in which agents update their states under a random external field (which points upward with probability $s$ and downward with probability $1-s$) with probability $p$ or adopt the unanimous opinion of $q$ randomly selected neighbors with probability $ 1-p$. Using mean-field analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we identify an order-disorder transition at $p_c$ when $s=\tfrac{1}{2}$. Notably, in the regime of $p&gt;p_c$, we estimate the time for systems to reach disordered state from consensus state and find the logarithmic scaling $T_{\text{dis}} \sim \mathcal{B}\ln N$, with $\mathcal{B} = 1/(2p)$ for $q = 1$, while for $q &gt; 1$, $\mathcal{B}$ depends on both $p &gt; p_c$ and $q$. We observe that disordering dynamics slow down significantly for nonlinear strengths $q$ between $2$ and $3$, independent of the probability $p$. On the other hand, when $s=0$ or $s=1$, the system is bound to reach consensus, with the consensus time scaling logarithmically with system size as $T_{\text{con}} \sim \mathcal{B}\ln N$, where $\mathcal{B} = 1/p$ for $q = 1$ and $\mathcal{B} = 1$ for $q &gt; 1$. Furthermore, in the limit of $p = 0$, we derive a closed-form exit probability valid for arbitrary values of $q$ and demonstrate a finite-size scaling collapse. These results clarify how external cues and peer conformity jointly control ordering and disordering in binary opinion dynamics.</description>
