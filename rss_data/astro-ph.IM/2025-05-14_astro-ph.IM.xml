      <title>Commissioning of a Commercial CMOS Camera for the Application of Lucky Image Technique on the Lulin One-meter Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lucky image (LI) is a technique to achieve near diffraction-limit high-angular resolution images for meter-class optical telescopes. In this work, by observing the core of globular cluster M15, we demonstrated the LI technique can be applied to a 1-meter telescope, the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT), together with a commercial-grade CMOS camera. We have also developed a method to sort the quality of the LI frames by measuring the mean intensity per pixel on the selected reference stars. For a LI-reconstructed image based on the best 10\%-selected frames, we achieved a $1.7\times$ improvement on the full-width at half-maximum over the conventional long-exposure image. When cross-matched the detected sources on the LI-reconstructed image to the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog, we obtained a mean difference of $-0.04\pm0.09$" and $-0.02\pm0.09$" on the right ascension and declination, respectively, as well as reaching to a $5\sigma$ depth of $\sim 17.9$ mag in the Gaia $G$-band.</description>

      <title>A numerically stable comoving frame solver for line radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative transfer is essential in astronomy, both for interpreting observations and simulating various astrophysical phenomena. However, self-consistent line radiative transfer is computationally expensive, especially in 3D. To reduce the computational cost when utilizing a discrete angular discretization, we use a comoving frame interpretation of the radiative transfer equation. The main innovation of this paper lies in the novel stabilization method for the resulting numerical discretization. The stabilization method is able to reduce spurious oscillatory behavior in the computed intensities, at the expense of extra boundary conditions which need to be enforced. We also implement an adaptive angular discretization for the ray-tracing implementation, in order to efficiently and accurately calculate the radiation field. Finally, we apply this new numerical method to compute NLTE line radiative transfer on a hydrodynamics model, showcasing its potential improvement in computation efficiency.</description>

      <title>viper: High-precision radial velocities from the optical to the infrared (Reaching 3 m/s in the K band of CRIRES+ with telluric modelling)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a number of new instruments and data reduction pipelines have been developed to obtain high-precision radial velocities (RVs). In particular in the optical, considerable progress has been made and RV precision below 50 cm/s has been reached. Yet, the RV precision in the near-infrared (NIR) is trailing behind. This is due to a number of factors, such as imprinted atmospheric absorption lines, lower stellar information content, different types of detectors, and usable calibration lamps. However, observations in the NIR are important for the search and study of exoplanets around cool low-mass stars that are faint at optical wavelengths. Not only are M dwarfs brightest in the NIR, the signal of stellar activity is also reduced at longer wavelengths. In this paper we introduce the RV pipeline viper (Velocity and IP EstimatoR). The philosophy of viper is to offer a publicly available and user-friendly code that is able to process data from various spectrographs. Originally designed to handle data from optical instruments, the code now has been extended to enable the processing of NIR data. viper uses a least-square fitting to model the stellar RV as well as the temporal and spatial variable IP. We have improved upon this method by adding a term for the telluric spectrum that enables the forward modelling of molecules present in the Earth's atmosphere. In this paper we use CRIRES+ observations in the K band to demonstrate viper's ability to handle data in the NIR. We show that it is possible to achieve an RV accuracy of 3 m/s over a period of 2.5 years with the use of a gas cell. Additionally, we present a study of the stability of atmospheric lines in the NIR. With viper it is possible to handle data taken with or without a gas cell, and we show that a long-term RV precision of around 10 m/s can be achieved when using only telluric lines for the wavelength calibration.</description>

      <title>GRIP: a generic data reduction package for nulling interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nulling interferometry is a powerful observing technique to study exoplanets and circumstellar dust at separations too small for direct imaging with single-dish telescopes. With recent photonics developments and the near-future ground-based instrumental projects, it bears the potential to detect young giant planets near the snow lines of their host stars. The observable quantity of a nulling interferometer is called the null depth, its precise measurement and calibration remain challenging against instrument and atmospheric noise. Null self-calibration is a method aiming to model the statistical distribution of the nulled signal. It has proven to be more sensitive and accurate than average-based data reduction methods in nulling interferometry. The variety of existing and upcoming of nullers raises the issue of consistency of the calibration process, structure of the data and the ability to reduce archived data on the long term. It has also led to many different implementations of the Null self-calibration method. In this article, we introduce GRIP: the first open-source toolbox to reduce nulling data with enhanced statistical self-calibration methods from any nulling interferometric instrument within a single and consistent framework. Astrophysical results show good consistency with two published GLINT and LBTI datasets and confirm nulling precision down to a few 10$^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>CHEOPS Ground Segment: Systems and Automation for Mission and Science Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CHEOPS, the first ESA small-class mission, has been performing photometric astronomical observations with a particular emphasis on exoplanetary science for the past five years. A distinctive feature of CHEOPS is that the responsibility for all operational aspects of the mission lies with the consortium rather than ESA. As a result, all subsystems, their architecture, and operational processes have been independently developed and tailored specifically to CHEOPS. This paper offers an overview of the CHEOPS operational subsystems, the design, and the automation framework that compose the two main components of the CHEOPS ground segment: the MOC and the SOC. This comprehensive description of the CHEOPS workflow aims to serve as a reference and potential source of inspiration for future small and/or independent space missions.</description>

      <title>L-BASS: a project to produce an absolutely calibrated 1.4 GHz sky map, I -- Scientific rationale and system overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L-BASS is an instrument designed to produce an absolutely calibrated map of the sky at a wavelength of 21 cm (L-band) with a radiometric accuracy of less than or equal to 0.1 K and with an angular resolution of 23 degrees. The prime motivations are to improve the temperature calibration of higher resolution maps and to investigate the steep spectrum radio background proposed by the ARCADE 2 team. The instrument consists of a pair of conical horn antennas which can scan independently in elevation; each antenna produces a circularly polarized output. The difference in signals from the antennas is measured with a continuous-comparison receiver connected to a digital spectrometer sampling the signal from 1400 MHz to 1425 MHz within the protected radio astronomy band. We describe the astrophysical motivation for the project, the design requirements and how these will be attained.</description>

      <title>Map-level baryonification: unified treatment of weak lensing two-point and higher-order statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision cosmology benefits from extracting maximal information from cosmic structures, motivating the use of higher-order statistics (HOS) at small spatial scales. However, predicting how baryonic processes modify matter statistics at these scales has been challenging. The baryonic correction model (BCM) addresses this by modifying dark-matter-only simulations to mimic baryonic effects, providing a flexible, simulation-based framework for predicting both two-point and HOS. We show that a 3-parameter version of the BCM can jointly fit weak lensing maps' two-point statistics, wavelet phase harmonics coefficients, scattering coefficients, and the third and fourth moments to within 2% accuracy across all scales $\ell &lt; 2000$ and tomographic bins for a DES-Y3-like redshift distribution ($z \lesssim 2$), using the FLAMINGO simulations. These results demonstrate the viability of BCM-assisted, simulation-based weak lensing inference of two-point and HOS, paving the way for robust cosmological constraints that fully exploit non-Gaussian information on small spatial scales.</description>

      <title>$\tau$HK: a modular housekeeping system for cryostats and balloon payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\tau$HK is a versatile experiment housekeeping (HK) system designed to perform cryogenic temperature readout and heater control on the upcoming Taurus balloon experiment. $\tau$HK, more broadly, is also suitable for ambient-temperature applications and general-purpose experiment input and output. It is built around an IEEE Eurocard subrack capable of housing up to 16 interchangeable daughter cards, allowing a fully populated system to support as many as 256 independent channels while drawing under 7.5\,W. This modular architecture allows experiments to expand on the existing daughter cards with ones tailored to their specific needs. There are currently three flavors of daughter cards: Resistive Temperature Device (RTD) readout, general purpose thermometer bias and readout, and load driver. The RTD board consists of a low noise lock-in amplifier that is limited only by device sensitivity over all temperature ranges. The general-purpose bias and readout board with chopping capability is primarily designed for thermometer diodes, but flexible enough to accommodate room temperature thermistors, Wheatstone bridges, optical encoders, and other devices. Finally, the load driver card can output an analog voltage for precise cryogenic heaters or it can be used to pulse width modulate high power loads. $\tau$HK is a power efficient solution for experimental housekeeping needs that is suited for the the harsh environment of stratospheric ballooning.</description>

      <title>Assessment of normalizing flows for parameter estimation on time-frequency representations of gravitational-wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The speed-up of parameter estimation is an active field of research in gravitational-wave data analysis. In this paper we present GP12, a deep-learning method that merges residual networks and normalising flows into a general-purpose, image-based estimator of binary black hole (BBH) parameters. Building on our early work we map BBH spectrograms from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors to colour channels in an RGB image amenable to be processed with residual networks. GP12 is trained on simulated data for BBH mergers obtained with the $\texttt{IMRPhenomPXHM}$ waveform approximant and tested for all three-detector events from the GWTC-3 and GWTC-2.1 catalogs reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration. Overall, our model yields good agreement with the LVK results over most parameters, with the worst performances found in the estimation of the luminosity distance and of the chirp mass. Our simple and fast-trainable model can produce large amounts of posterior samples in a few seconds, complementing existing approaches with normalising flows based on time or frequency representation of gravitational-wave data. We also discuss current shortcomings of our model and possible improvements for future extensions (e.g. including noise conditioning from the detectors' PSD or augmenting the number of trainable parameters to enhance expressivity).</description>

      <title>Improving the detection significance of gravitational wave transient searches with CNN models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) transient searches rely on signal-noise discriminators to distinguish astrophysical signals from noise artefacts. These discriminators are typically tuned towards expected signal morphologies, which may limit their effectiveness as detector sensitivity improves and more complex signals, such as from core collapse supernovae or compact binary mergers featuring precession, higher-order harmonics, or eccentricity, become detectable. In this work, we use a Convolutional Neural Network-based approach to classify noise transients from astrophysical transients, aiming to enhance the sensitivity of existing searches. We evaluate our method on two matched filter based searches, PyCBC-IMBH and PyCBC-HM tuned for Intermediate Mass Black Hole (IMBH) binary systems. Our approach improves the sensitive volume-time reach of these searches by approximately 30% at a false alarm rate of once per 100 years. Finally, we apply our method to the first four chunks of the first half of the third observation run and demonstrate a marked improvement in significance. In particular, we significantly improve the first IMBH binary GW event GW190521 with an IFAR exceeding 42000 years.</description>

      <title>Imagination and Understanding through Astrophysical Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific articles, for instance in the field of astrophysics, are often filled with a variety of images. In philosophical studies, these images are usually analyzed in terms of their function within the scientific argument presented in the article. However, not all images that can be found in astrophysical articles are relevant to the scientific argument, which prompts the question of why they are included in the first place. Using the example of the so-called Stellar Graveyard plot, I argue that the work of Letitia Meynell provides a valuable description of this kind of imagery. That is, there are images used in astrophysical literature that may not be necessary for the scientific argument, but function as an aide for the visual imagination of the reader. These kinds of aides can help with mentally visualizing certain spatial configurations and the causal relationships within them, ultimately furthering understanding of the discussed astrophysical concepts or models.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Antikythera Mechanism s Central Front dial parts Division and Placement of the Zodiac Dial ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze, discuss and present the design of the Antikythera Mechanism s central front parts. Based on the aligned and of same scale visual images of Fragment C front/back face and the X-ray CT scacs, we designed and reconstructed in bronze, the four independent parts comprising the central front dial. We then correlated the zodiac dial ring with 365 equal subdivisions-days and we investigated the number of days per astronomical season and per zodiac month. Then, we adopted a specific number of equal subdivisions/days per each zodiac month and we engraved these on the bronze zodiac month ring. The different number of days per zodiac month created 12 unequal epicenter angles on the zodiac dial ring and therefore the solar anomaly and the unequal time span of the astronomical seasons were well represented on the Antikythera Mechanism. In this way, the functionality of the central front dial of the Mechanism was achieved by adopting the minimum number of hypotheses.</description>

      <title>PoET: the Paranal solar ESPRESSO Telescope</title>

Abstract: The detection and characterisation of other "Earths", orbiting other suns, is a bold objective of present-day astrophysics. However, this quest is severely challenged by astrophysical "noise" from the host stars, whose signatures distort the observed spectra. Motivated by this problem, we are building a dedicated facility, the Paranal solar ESPRESSO Telescope (PoET). PoET will collect solar light and channel it into the ESPRESSO spectrograph, allowing us to use the Sun as a proxy to unambiguously identify and understand the sources of relevant variability in solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Tangent point position and atmosphere composition in limb scanning instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the forward model for limb-scanning instruments, ray tracing must be accounted for because variations in air refractivity cause the lines of sight to bend from straight paths into curves. The tangent point of a line of sight is defined as the minimum height point. The lines of sight can be adjusted by varying the nadir angles of the instrument, which must be calibrated to account for Earth's ellipticity and the actual atmospheric conditions sampled by these paths. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the nadir angles, atmospheric properties, and tangent point positions, using a configuration relevant to the CAIRT instrument. Atmospheric data from reanalysis databases are utilized, and the lines of sight are determined by numerically solving the Eikonal equation. Our findings are compared to those of a previous study conducted for the MIPAS instrument, highlighting key differences.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15-year Gravitational-Wave Background Methods</title>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) use an array of millisecond pulsars to search for gravitational waves in the nanohertz regime in pulse time of arrival data. This paper presents rigorous tests of PTA methods, examining their consistency across the relevant parameter space. We discuss updates to the 15-year isotropic gravitational-wave background analyses and their corresponding code representations. Descriptions of the internal structure of the flagship algorithms Enterprise and PTMCMCSampler are given to facilitate understanding of the PTA likelihood structure, how models are built, and what methods are currently used in sampling the high-dimensional PTA parameter space. We introduce a novel version of the PTA likelihood that uses a two-step marginalization procedure that performs much faster in gravitational wave searches, reducing the required resources facilitating the computation of Bayes factors via thermodynamic integration and sampling a large number of realizations for computing Bayesian false-alarm probabilities. We perform stringent tests of consistency and correctness of the Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods. For the Bayesian analysis, we test prior recovery, simulation recovery, and Bayes factors. For the frequentist analysis, we test that the optimal statistic, when modified to account for a non-negligible gravitational-wave background, accurately recovers the amplitude of the background. We also summarize recent advances and tests performed on the optimal statistic in the literature from both GWB detection and parameter estimation perspectives. The tests presented here validate current analyses of PTA data.</description>

      <title>Super-Jeans fragmentation in massive star-forming regions revealed by triangulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the fragmentation of the gas cloud and the formation of massive stars remains one of the most challenging questions of modern astrophysical research. Either the gas fragments in a Jeans-like fashion, after which the fragments grow through accretion, or the fragmentation length is larger than the Jeans length from the start. Despite significant observational efforts, a consensus has not been reached. The key is to infer the initial density distribution upon which gravitational fragmentation occurs. Since cores are the products of the fragmentation process, the distances between adjacent cores serve as a scale indicator. Based on this observation, we propose a Delaunay triangulation-based approach to infer the density structure before the fragmentation and establish the link between density distribution and gas fragmentation length. We find that at low density, the fragmentation is Jeans-like, and at high densities, the core separations are larger than the prediction of the Jeans fragmentation. This super-Jeans fragmentation is a key step toward the formation of massive stars.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Analytic Empirical Model of the Gaia Data Release 3 Astrometric Orbit Catalog Selection Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In June 2022, the Gaia mission released a catalog of astrometric orbital solutions for 168,065 binary systems, by far the largest such catalog to date. The catalog's selection function is difficult to characterize because of choices made in its construction. Understanding the catalog's selection function is required to model and interpret its contents. We use a combination of analytic and empirical prescriptions to construct a function that computes the probability that a binary with a given set of properties would have been published in the Gaia Data Release 3 astrometric orbit catalog. This is a complementary approach to the more accurate but significantly more computationally expensive approach of El-Badry et al. (2024). We also construct a binary population synthesis model to validate our characterization of the selection function, finding good agreement with the actual Gaia NSS catalog, with the exception of the orbital eccentricity distribution. The NSS catalog suggests high-eccentricity orbits are relatively uncommon at intermediate periods $100 \lesssim P_{orb} \lesssim 1000$ days. As an example application of the selection function, we estimate the Gaia DR3 detection probabilities of the star + BH binaries Gaia BH1 and BH2, and find them to be 0.38 and 0.27, respectively. Compared to the values obtained by detailed modeling in El-Badry et al. (2024), the probabilities are identical for BH1, and within a factor of 2 for BH2. We also estimate the population of Sun-like star + BH binaries in the Galaxy to be $\sim 3000$ for $100 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 400$ day, $&lt; 800$ for $400 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1000$ day, and $&lt; 12,000$ for $1000 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1500$ day.</description>

      <title>Shock-capturing particle hydrodynamics with reproducing kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and explore a new shock-capturing particle hydrodynamics approach. Our starting point is a commonly used discretization of smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We enhance this discretization with Roe's approximate Riemann solver, we identify its dissipative terms, and in these terms, we use slope-limited linear reconstruction. All gradients needed for our method are calculated with linearly reproducing kernels that are constructed to enforce the two lowest-order consistency relations. We scrutinize our reproducing kernel implementation carefully on a "glass-like" particle distribution, and we find that constant and linear functions are recovered to machine precision. We probe our method in a series of challenging 3D benchmark problems ranging from shocks over instabilities to Schulz-Rinne-type vorticity-creating shocks. All of our simulations show excellent agreement with analytic/reference solutions.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Coalescence Gravitational Wave Signals Counting and Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatories approach unprecedented sensitivities, the need for robust methods to analyze increasingly complex, overlapping signals becomes ever more pressing. Existing matched-filtering approaches and deep-learning techniques can typically handle only one or two concurrent signals, offering limited adaptability to more varied and intricate superimposed waveforms. To overcome these constraints, we present the UnMixFormer, an attention-based architecture that not only identifies the unknown number of concurrent compact binary coalescence GW events but also disentangles their individual waveforms through a multi-decoder architecture, even when confronted with five overlapping signals. Our UnMixFormer is capable of capturing both short- and long-range dependencies by modeling them in a dual-path manner, while also enhancing periodic feature representation by incorporating Fourier Analysis Networks. Our approach adeptly processes binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole systems over extended time series data (16,384 samples). When evaluating on synthetic data with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 10 to 50, our method achieves 99.89% counting accuracy, a mean overlap of 0.9831 between separated waveforms and templates, and robust generalization ability to waveforms with spin precession, orbital eccentricity, and higher modes, marking a substantial advance in the precision and versatility of GW data analysis.</description>
