      <title>Phase-Locking Parametric Instability Coupling Longitudinal and Transverse Waves on Rivulets in a Hele-Shaw Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an instability exhibited by a fluid system when coupling two distinct types of waves, both linearly damped. While none of them is unstable on its own, they amplify one another, resulting in a previously unreported convective instability. An external excitation is used to induce a parametric cross-coupling between longitudinal and transverse deformations of a liquid bridge between two vertical glass plates. Coherent amplification results in waves satisfying a synchronization condition, which selects a precise wavelength. We derive a model for this instability using depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, showing the physical origin of the coamplification, and confirm its relevance experimentally. Our findings open new perspectives in the study of parametrically controlled pattern formation, and invites the search for analogous parametric cross-coupling instabilities in other systems exhibiting distinct wave types, from plasma to elastic media.</description>

      <title>Orientation selection in alloy dendritic evolution during melt-pool solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigations of directionally solidifying melt pools during metal additive manufacturing (AM) reveal that the resulting subgrain cellular structures often grow along crystalline orientations different from the temperature gradient direction, some of which are not even along preferred crystallographic directions. It is well-known that dendrite orientation results from the growth competition between the heat flow direction and preferred crystallographic orientation. Specifically, the competition between interfacial anisotropy and process anisotropy (thermal gradient and growth velocity) during directional solidification leads to rich morphological diversity of the resulting dendritic structures, including tilted dendrites and seaweed patterns. The orientation selection mechanisms of such patterns remain unexplored at high velocity in the frame of AM. This study examines the tilted growth of cellular-dendritic arrays as a function of the misorientation angle ($\theta_R$) between the thermal gradient and crystal lattice directions and other relevant control parameters. We use a phase-field model to explore dendritic evolution in a binary alloy during high-velocity solidification in 2D. We find marked effects of thermal gradient, growth velocity, alloy composition, and anisotropy parameters on the possible growth directions and the primary arm spacing, constitutional undercooling, microsegregation, and secondary phases that arise during dendritic solidification. Our work provides a detailed yet concise presentation on the tilted growth and morphological transition for a broad range of thermal conditions in the high-velocity regime and the full range of $\theta_R$ for establishing orientation selection maps. These results should have qualitative relevance for controlling the subgrain structure, chemical segregation, and texture randomization in commercial dendrite materials relevant to AM.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Propagation in Water-Sorbing Carbon Xerogel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adsorption of water vapor in nanoporous carbons is rather complex due to an interplay between the pore structure and surface chemistry of these materials. Deciphering the mechanism of adsorption requires the knowledge of the spatial distribution and the filling fraction of the adsorbed water. Characteristics of ultrasonic wave propagation through a nanoporous sample provides a wealth of information such as properties of fluids confined in the pores and spatial distribution of adsorbate in the pores. Here we studied water vapor adsorption on carbon xerogel, with a bimodal pore size distribution consisting of micropores (1 nm) and mesopores (8 nm) and overall porosity 68%. The relative humidity was increased in steps and the amount of water adsorbed by the sample was measured gravimetrically at each step, producing a type V isotherm, characteristic of water adsorption to weakly interacting carbon nanopores. Concurrently, we recorded the waveforms for longitudinal and transverse ultrasonic waves that passed through the sample at each saturation step. These measurements provided the wave amplitudes and speeds as a function of relative humidity, and these data were used to calculate the elastic moduli and ultrasonic attenuation of the xerogel-water composite. Analysis of the elastic moduli evolution suggested that confined water shows nearly bulk-like properties in mesopores, while in micropores its modulus noticeably differs from that of bulk water, consistent with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the observed increase in ultrasonic attenuation during micropore filling indicated the spatial heterogeneity of the water-filled pore space within the overall sample volume. Overall, this study demonstrates the successful utilization of nondestructive ultrasonic testing to probe the fluid adsorption mechanism in a nanoporous medium and the properties of adsorbed phase.</description>

      <title>Theory of the Photomolecular Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that water in both liquid and vapor phases exhibits exceptionally weak absorption of light in the visible range. Recent experiments, however, have demonstrated that at the liquid-air interface, absorption in the visible range is drastically increased. This increased absorption results in a rate of evaporation that exceeds the theoretical thermal limit by between two and five times. Curiously, the evaporation rate peaks at green wavelengths of light, while no corresponding absorptance peak has been observed. Experiments suggest that photons can cleave off clusters of water molecules at the surface, but no clear theoretical model has yet been proposed to explain how this is possible. This paper aims to present such a model and explain this surprising and important phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Finite Disorder Critical Point in the Brittle-to-Ductile Transition of Amorphous Solids in the Presence of Particle Pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical yielding of amorphous solids under external loading can be broadly classified into ductile and brittle types, depending on whether their macroscopic stress response is smooth or abrupt, respectively. Recently, it has been shown that these two regimes, obtained by tuning the degree of annealing of the system, are separated by a critical point at a finite inherent disorder strength. Here, we demonstrate a transition from brittle yielding to ductile yielding by introducing quenched disorder in the form of randomly pinned particles. The well-annealed samples, which exhibit brittle yielding, undergo a transition to increasingly ductile yielding with increasing pinning concentrations while exhibiting an enhanced stress overshoot. Extensive finite size analysis is performed to demonstrate the critical nature of the transition at a finite pinning concentration and the various scaling exponents obtained are found to be in good agreement with the reported values. Finally, we show a direct correspondence with the shear band width and the critical pining concentration to establish a possible connection between inherent disorder strength and quenched disorder strength due to particle pinning.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this book chapter we describe recent applications of artificial intelligence and in particular machine learning to active matter systems. Active matter is composed of agents, or particles, that are capable of propelling themselves. While biological agents like bacteria, fish or birds naturally possess a certain degree of "intelligence", synthetic active particles like colloidal microswimmers and electronic robots can be equipped with different levels of artificial intelligence, either internally (as for robots) or via a dynamic external control system. This book chapter briefly discusses existing approaches to make synthetic particles increasingly "intelligent" and then focuses on the usage of machine learning to approach navigation and communication problems of active particles. Basic questions are how to steer a single active agent through a complex environment to reach or discover a target in an optimal way and how active particles need to cooperate to efficiently collect a distribution of targets (e.g. nutrients or toxins) from their complex environment.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Life: Exploring Information as a Distinctive Feature of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the idea that information is an essential and distinctive feature of living systems. Unlike non-living systems, living systems actively acquire, process, and use information about their environments to respond to changing conditions, sustain themselves, and achieve other intrinsic goals. We discuss relevant theoretical frameworks such as ``semantic information'' and ``fitness value of information''. We also highlight the broader implications of our perspective for fields such as origins-of-life research and astrobiology. In particular, we touch on the transition to information-driven systems as a key step in abiogenesis, informational constraints as determinants of planetary habitability, and informational biosignatures for detecting life beyond Earth. We briefly discuss experimental platforms which offer opportunities to investigate these theoretical concepts in controlled environments. By integrating theoretical and experimental approaches, this perspective advances our understanding of life's informational dynamics and its universal principles across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Investigation on non-ergodicity of protein dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of microscopic protein dynamics has historically presented significant challenges to researchers seeking to develop a comprehensive and detailed description of its diverse and intriguing features. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have proposed the hypothesis that protein dynamics may be non-ergodic. The implications of this finding are of paramount importance from both a practical and theoretical standpoint. In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to examine these results over a time window spanning from picoseconds to nanoseconds. To this end, we utilize widely used statistical tools. Our findings challenge the conclusions of previous studies, which suggested that proteins exhibit non-ergodic dynamics. Instead, we demonstrate that deviations from ergodic behavior are due to incomplete convergence of the investigated quantities. Additionally, we discuss the implications of findings that suggest a potential breaking of the ergodic hypothesis over larger time windows, which were not directly investigated in this study.</description>

      <title>Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens off as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</description>

      <title>Enhanced condensate fluidity in modified patchy particle models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are formed via liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins, often together with nucleic acids, typically driven by interactions between low-affinity binding sites. The computational study of such condensates that accounts both for the droplet-scale fluid behavior and the internal structure of the condensate requires coarse-grained models. Recently, patchy particle models, representing proteins as sphere with a repulsive core and directional attractive patches, have emerged as a powerful tool. However, these simulations are typically limited by slow dynamics and struggle to capture the full range of material properties of fluid-like condensates.
  Here we study modified patchy particle models to simulate the formation and dynamics of biomolecular condensates. By incorporating flexible patches and weak isotropic attractions between cores, our models preserve key equilibrium characteristics, including the phase behavior and the local structure of the condensate, while significantly accelerating the system dynamics. These modifications enable the simulation of larger, more complex systems previously inaccessible due to prohibitive relaxation times and provide a versatile tool for studying condensate dynamics.</description>

      <title>General Solution for Elastic Networks on Arbitrary Curved Surfaces in the Absence of Rotational Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding crystal growth over arbitrary curved surfaces with arbitrary boundaries is a formidable challenge, stemming from the complexity of formulating non-linear elasticity using geometric invariant quantities. Solutions are generally confined to systems exhibiting rotational symmetry. In this paper, we introduce a framework to address these challenges by numerically solving these equations without relying on inherent symmetries. We illustrate our approach by computing the minimum energy required for an elastic network containing a disclination at any point and by investigating surfaces that lack rotational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the transition from a defect-free structure to a stable state with a single 5-fold or 7-fold disclination strongly depends on the shape of the domain, emphasizing the profound influence of edge geometry. We discuss the implications of our results for general experimental systems, particularly in elucidating the assembly pathways of virus capsids. This research enhances our understanding of crystal growth on complex surfaces and expands its applications across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano- to micro-sized particles with differently charged surface areas exhibit complex interaction patterns, characterized by both opposite-charge attraction and like-charge repulsion. While several successful models have been proposed in the literature to describe directional attraction, models accounting for both directional attraction and directional repulsion are much less numerous and often tailored to specific microscopic systems. Here we present a simple and versatile patchy model, where the interaction energy of a pair of particles is a sum of interactions between sites of different types located within the particle volume. We implement different formulations of this model in both a self-developed Monte Carlo code and the widely used LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics simulation software, providing basic toolkits for both simulation methods and, in the latter case, for different algorithms. By comparing physical observables and code performances, we discuss the different models, methods, and algorithms, offering insights into optimization strategies and tricks of trade.</description>

      <title>WeTICA: A directed search weighted ensemble based enhanced sampling method to estimate rare event kinetics in a reduced dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating rare event kinetics from molecular dynamics simulations is a non-trivial task despite the great advances in enhanced sampling methods. Weighted Ensemble (WE) simulation, a special class of enhanced sampling techniques, offers a way to directly calculate kinetic rate constants from biased trajectories without the need to modify the underlying energy landscape using bias potentials. Conventional WE algorithms use different binning schemes to partition the collective variable (CV) space separating the two metastable states of interest. In this work, we have developed a new "binless" WE simulation algorithm to bypass the hurdles of optimizing binning procedures. Our proposed protocol (WeTICA) uses a low-dimensional CV space to drive the WE simulation toward the specified target state. We have applied this new algorithm to recover the unfolding kinetics of three proteins: (A) TC5b Trp-cage mutant, (B) TC10b Trp-cage mutant, and (C) Protein G, with unfolding times spanning the range between 3 and 40 {\mu}s using projections along predefined fixed Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) eigenvectors as CVs. Calculated unfolding times converge to the reported values with good accuracy with more than one order of magnitude less cumulative WE simulation time than the unfolding time scales with or without a priori knowledge of the CVs that can capture unfolding. Our algorithm can be used with other linear CVs, not limited to TICA. Moreover, the new walker selection criteria for resampling employed in this algorithm can be used on more sophisticated nonlinear CV space for further improvements of binless WE methods.</description>

      <title>A study of pendular liquid bridge between two equal solid spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridian between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing on some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations as well as a few curve-fitting formulas. The separation distance between spheres is shown to play an important role in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation for a given relative humidity as well as the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and can provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with so complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and by their approximative nature would always leave rooms for improvements; therefore, care should be taken to avoid undesirable errors.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Driven Acceleration of First-Passage Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that confinement geometry can act as a rectifier in passive diffusion, optimally accelerating first-passage rates beyond free diffusion. Using analytic theory based on the Fick-Jacobs approach and Brownian dynamics simulations, we find nonmonotonic mean first-passage rates driven by entropy. Through the transmission probability, our findings highlight how confinement optimizes transport dynamics in trap-and-escape processes, with implications for molecular translocation and reaction kinetics in soft matter and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond the band edge: Unveiling high-mobility hot carriers in a two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot carriers, inheriting excess kinetic energy from high-energy photons, underpin numerous optoelectronic applications involving non-equilibrium transport processes. Current research on hot carriers has predominantly focused on inorganic materials, with little attention paid to organic-based systems due to their ultrafast energy relaxation and inefficient charge transport. Here, we overturn this paradigm by demonstrating highly mobile hot carriers in solution-processable, highly crystalline two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer (2D c-CP) Cu3BHT (BHT = benzenehexathiol) films. Leveraging a suite of ultrafast spectroscopic and imaging techniques, we unravel the microscopic charge transport landscape in Cu3BHT films following non-equilibrium photoexcitation across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, revealing two distinct high-mobility transport regimes. In the non-equilibrium transport regime, hot carriers achieve ultrahigh mobility of ~2,000 cm2 V-1 s-1, traversing grain boundaries up to 300 nm within a picosecond. In the quasi-equilibrium transport regime, free carriers exhibit Drude-type band-like transport with a remarkable mobility of ~400 cm2 V-1 s-1 and an intrinsic diffusion length exceeding 1 micrometer. These findings establish 2D c-CPs as versatile platforms for exploring high-mobility non-equilibrium transport, unlocking new opportunities for organic-based hot carrier applications.</description>

      <title>Energy landscape interpretation of universal linearly increasing absorption with frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absorption of elastic waves in complex media is commonly found to increase linearly with frequency, for both longitudinal and shear waves. This ubiquitous property is observed in media such as rocks, unconsolidated sediments, and human tissue. Absorption is due to relaxation processes at the level of atomic scales and up to the sub-micron scale of biological materials. The effect of these processes is usually expressed as an integral over relaxation frequencies or relaxation times. Here we argue that these processes are thermally activated. Unusual for ultrasonics and seismics, we can therefore transform the expression for absorption from the frequency or time domains to an integral over an activation energy landscape weighted by an energy distribution. The universal power-law property surprisingly corresponds to a flat activation energy landscape. This is the solution which maximizes entropy or randomness. Therefore the linearly increasing absorption corresponds to the energy landscape with the fewest possible constraints.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic insights into Z-ring formation and stability: A Langevin dynamics approach to FtsZ self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tubulin-like protein FtsZ is crucial for cytokinesis in bacteria and many archaea, forming a ring-shaped structure called the Z-ring at the site of cell division. Despite extensive research, the self-assembly of Z-rings is not entirely understood. We propose a theoretical model based on FtsZ's known filament structures, treating them as semiflexible polymers with specific mechanical properties and lateral inter-segment attraction that can stabilize ring formations. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal various morphological phases, including open helices, chains, rings, and globules, capturing experimental observations in the fission yeast model using FtsZ from different bacterial species or mutants of Escherichia coli. Using our theoretical model, we explore how treadmilling activity affects Z-ring stability and identify a spooling mechanism of ring formation. The active ring produces contractile, shear, and rotational stresses, which intensify as the Z-ring transitions to an open helix at high activity.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of orientationally disordered barocalorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the archetypal BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe for the first time the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bonding network. We use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window neutron scattering studies in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</description>
