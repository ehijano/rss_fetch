      <title>Exact Closed-form Solutions for Lamb's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we report on an exact closed-form solution for the displacement at the surface of an elastic half-space elicited by a buried point source that acts at some point underneath that surface. This is commonly referred to as the 3-D Lamb's problem, for which previous solutions were restricted to sources and receivers placed at the free surface. By means of the reciprocity theorem, our solution should also be valid as a means to obtain the displacements at interior points when the source is placed at the free surface. We manage to obtain explicit results by expressing the solution in terms of elementary algebraic expression as well as elliptic integrals. We anchor our developments on Poisson's ratio 0.25 starting from Johnson's (1974) integral solutions which must be computed numerically. In the end, our closed-form results agree perfectly with the numerical results of Johnson (1974), which strongly confirms the correctness of our explicit formulas. It is hoped that in due time, these formulas may constitute a valuable canonical solution that will serve as a yardstick against which other numerical solutions can be compared and measured.</description>

      <title>SiameseLSRTM: Enhancing least-squares reverse time migration with a Siamese network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) is an inversion-based imaging method rooted in optimization theory, which iteratively updates the reflectivity model to minimize the difference between observed and simulated data. However, in real data applications, the Born-based simulated data, based on simplified physics, like the acoustic assumption, often under represent the complexity within observed data. Thus, we develop SiameseLSRTM, a novel approach that employs a Siamese network consisting of two identical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with shared weights to measure the difference between simulated and observed data. Specifically, the shared-weight CNNs in the Siamese network enable the extraction of comparable features from both observed and simulated data, facilitating more effective data matching and ultimately improving imaging accuracy. SiameseLSRTM is a self-supervised framework in which the network parameters are updated during the iterative LSRTM process, without requiring extensive labeled data and prolonged training. We evaluate SiameseLSRTM using two synthetic datasets and one field dataset from a land seismic survey, showing that it produces higher-resolution and more accurate imaging results compared to traditional LSRTM.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Frequency-domain Acoustic Full Waveform Inversion Using Gaussian Random Fields and Ensemble Kalman Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, uncertainty-aware full waveform inversion (FWI) has received increasing attention, with a growing emphasis on producing informative uncertainty estimates alongside inversion results. Bayesian inference methods--particularly Monte Carlo-based approaches--have been widely employed to quantify uncertainty. However, these techniques often require extensive posterior sampling, resulting in high computational costs. To address this challenge and enable efficient uncertainty quantification in FWI, we introduce an uncertainty-aware FWI framework--EKI-GRFs-FWI--that integrates Gaussian random fields (GRFs) with the ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) algorithm. This approach jointly infers subsurface velocity fields and provides reliable uncertainty estimates in a computationally efficient manner. The EKI algorithm leverages a derivative-free update mechanism and employs effective stopping criteria to ensure rapid convergence, making it suitable for large-scale inverse problems. Meanwhile, GRFs incorporate prior knowledge of spatial smoothness and correlation length scales, enabling the generation of physically plausible initial ensembles for EKI. Numerical results demonstrate that EKI-GRFs-FWI yields reasonably accurate velocity reconstructions while delivering informative uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Polar motion of Venus</title>

Abstract: Five Venus missions are under development to study the planet in the next decade, with both NASA's VERITAS and ESA's EnVision featuring a geophysical investigation among their objectives. Their radar and gravity experiments will determine Venus's orientation, enabling spin dynamics analyses to infer geophysical and atmospheric properties. This work aims to characterize Venus's polar motion -- the motion of its spin axis in a body-fixed frame-focusing on signatures from its interior and atmosphere to support its potential detection by future orbiters. We develop a polar motion model for a triaxial planet accounting for solar torque, centrifugal and tidal deformations of a viscoelastic mantle, and atmospheric dynamics. Core-mantle coupling effects are analyzed separately considering a simplified spherical core. We compute the period and damping time of the free motion -- called the Chandler wobble -- and determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the forced motion. We revisit the Chandler frequency expression. Solar torque is the dominant phenomenon affecting Venus's Chandler frequency, increasing it by a factor of 2.75. Our model predicts a Chandler period in the range [12900 ; 18900] years. The Chandler wobble appears as a linear polar drift of about 90 meters on Venus's surface during EnVision's 4-year primary mission, at the limit of its resolution. We also predict forced polar motion oscillations with an amplitude of about 20 meters, driven by the atmosphere and the solar torque. Compared to the 240-meter spin axis precession occurring in inertial space over this duration, these results suggest that Venus's polar motion could also be detectable by future orbiters. It should be incorporated into rotation models when anticipating these missions, providing additional constraints on Venus's interior structure.</description>

      <title>Sealing Europa's vents by vapor deposition: An order of magnitude study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractures and vents in the ice crust of Europa, exposing the sub-surface ocean or liquid-water inclusions to the vacuum, might be responsible for the generation of water-vapor plumes. During its passage through the ice, the plume vapor is expected to partially condense on the cold ice walls. Together with other effects (water spillage, compression forces, etc.) this mechanism likely contributes to sealing the vent. In this work, we develop a simple lumped-parameter model that can quantify how quickly a hypothetical vent of prescribed width would be sealed via water-vapor deposition. As an example, we apply our model to the vent size and density conditions inferred from the 2012 Hubble Space Telescope plume detection, predicting a sealing time of about 30 minutes. This suggests that the actual ice fracture might have been larger than originally proposed and/or the plume density at the vent might have been lower. While many other effects could have been present and responsible for sealing the vent, our estimates indicate that vapor deposition might have played a major role in eventually shutting off the observed plume. A map of sealing times vs. plume density, mass flow rate and aperture areas is given. Plume quantities from the literature are analyzed and compared to our results. For a given plume density/mass flow rate, small apertures would be sealed quickly by vapor deposition and are thus incompatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Decadal analysis of sea surface temperature patterns, climatology, and anomalies in temperate coastal waters with Landsat-8 TIRS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter characterising the thermal state of sea surface. Due to the intricate thermal interactions between land, sea, and atmosphere, the spatial gradients of SST in coastal waters often appear at finer spatial scales than those in open ocean waters. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first analysed the spatiotemporal patterns of SST in South Australia's temperate coastal waters from 2014 to 2023 by developing an operational approach for SST retrieval from the Landsat-8 TIRS sensor. A buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to validate the quality of SST retrievals. Then the daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months. We hope these findings would be helpful in supporting the fishing and aquaculture industries in the coastal waters of South Australia.</description>
