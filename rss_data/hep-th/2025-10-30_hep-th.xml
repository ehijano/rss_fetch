      <title>Gravitational dressing: from the crossed product to more general algebraic and mathematical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crossed product, and consequent transition from von Neumann algebras of type III to II, is recovered from a truncation of more general gravitational dressing constructions, about certain spacetimes. This is done by extending "standard dressing" constructions previously used to give a perturbative definition of "gravitational splittings," defining approximate localization of information. This result appears to illustrate that this algebraic transition is a small piece of a more general algebraic, or other mathematical, structure associated with quantum gravity. The leading-order structure involves noncommutativity from separated regions, and at the nonperturbative level connects with a possible explanation of holographic behavior for gravity.</description>

      <title>Large-$N$ Free Energy of Chiral $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-Matter Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first successful large-$N$ computation of the $S^3$ free energy in chiral $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter theories, long believed to evade the universal M2-brane scaling $F_{S^3}\!\sim\!N^{3/2}$. Using a stable numerical continuation method that directly solves the saddle-point equations, we obtain convergent large-$N$ solutions for benchmark chiral quivers, including the holographic dual to AdS$_4\times Q^{1,1,1}/\mathbb{Z}_k$ and $D_3$ models. The resulting free energies precisely match the holographic predictions, resolving a decade-old puzzle in AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ and establishing a practical computational framework for precision holography in strongly coupled gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The Weight of $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Little Strings: T-duality and Hasse Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the worldvolume theories of stacks of $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ heterotic NS5-branes probing a transverse singularity $\mathfrak{g}$. We revisit and extend the original classification by Blum and Intriligator, and show that the resulting 6d Little String Theories (LSTs) are naturally labeled by affine dominant coweights of the singularity $\mathfrak{g}$. This in turn enables us to efficiently arrange these theories into groupings satisfying all known necessary conditions to be T-dual. Using this formulation, we then study the partial order of those coweights, and extend a recently proposed slice-subtraction algorithm to construct Hasse diagrams for LSTs directly from their six-dimensional generalized quivers, allowing us to probe certain properties of their Higgs branch. Along the way, we exploit these techniques to show that the number of duality orbits at maximal flavor rank is determined by the center of the transverse singularity $\mathfrak{g}$, and provide a simplified proof of a monotonicity theorem for this class of theories. Finally, we show how some of our techniques can be extended to other classes of 6d theories, such as Type-II LSTs and SCFTs.</description>

      <title>How to uplift non-maximal gauged supergravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an algorithm to perform the uplift of non-maximal $G_g$-gauged supergravities to type IIB or 11D supergravities. Using tools of exceptional field theory and generalised geometry, we show that the internal manifold admits a $G_g$-action, and that consistency of the uplift is equivalent to solving a simpler PDE on the quotient $M_{\text{int}}/G_g$. As an application, we classify all possible uplifts of pure half-maximal four-dimensional $\textrm{SO}(4)$-gauged supergravity to type IIB and we recover consistent truncations around any of the D'Hoker-Estes-Gutperle solutions \cite{DHoker:2007hhe}.</description>

      <title>Revisiting zero modes and cluster decomposition at the late-time boundary of de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the literature on locality on de Sitter with the goal to organize the main results with respect to the representation theory of the isometry group of four dimensional de Sitter. We make use of the late-time behavior of two-point functions of principal and discrete series representation, both in physical and in field space and compare the role of the zero modes. Our overall conclusion is that when it comes to locality on de Sitter, analyzed in terms of cluster decomposition, the principal series representation that capture matter fields and discrete series representations that capture gauge fields show different behavior. Focusing on scalars as a first analysis, matter fields show explicit signs of respecting cluster decomposition while gauge fields do not.</description>

      <title>Covariance of Scattering Amplitudes from Counting Carefully</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invariance of on-shell scattering amplitudes under field redefinitions is a well known property in field theory that corresponds to covariance of on-shell amputated connected functions. In recent years there have been great efforts to define a formalism in which the covariance is manifest at all stages of calculation, mainly resorting to geometrical interpretations. In this work covariance is analysed using combinatorial methods relying only on the properties of the tree level effective action, without referring to specific formulations of the Lagrangian. We provide an explicit proof of covariance of on-shell connected functions and of the existence of covariant Feynman rules and we derive an explicitly covariant closed formula for tree level on-shell connected functions with any number of external legs.</description>

      <title>Non-Commutative Geometry for D-Branes in Large R-R Field Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the role of non-commutative geometry in D$p$-branes within large R-R field backgrounds. In this context, the background of a significant ($p-1$)-form R-R field can be effectively described using a ($p-1$)-bracket, similar to the method used in the NS-NS case. We begin by recalling how non-commutative geometry arises from the quantization of open string theory. In this framework, the Seiberg-Witten map is a key element that establishes the equivalence between commutative and non-commutative descriptions in the low-energy effective theory. The Poisson bracket characterizes non-commutative structures, with deformation achieved through the Moyal product. Next, we show how the Nambu-Poisson bracket emerges in the context of a single D4-brane with the large R-R field background limit, starting from the BLG model. The generalization to a D$p$-brane leads to the ($p-1$)-bracket description, which reveals a duality web relating NS-NS and R-R field backgrounds via T-duality and S-duality in the low-energy limit. Finally, we extend the single D-brane construction to multiple D-branes by promoting the ordinary product in the bracket to a covariant derivative at the Poisson level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study configurations of two $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theories of unitary gauge groups connected by the BPS interfaces involving line operators. We find strong evidence of S-duality of the configurations as precise matching of the line defect half-indices which enumerate the BPS local operators at the junctions of the interfaces and line operators. The interface line defect half-indices are expressible as intriguing closed-form formulae involving the $q$-binomial coefficients and the principal specializations of the Schur functions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly footprints in SM+Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a follow-up of arXiv:2412.07470 [hep-th]. A simplified version of the SM plus gravity, put forward there, is presented here and some of its aspects delved into. The basic structure consists of two sectors, left and right, with chirally mirror fermions and scalars, as well as $SU(3)$ and $U(1)$ gauge fields, while the $SU(2)$ gauge fields as well as the metric are in common to both sectors. This structure is dictated by the request to cancel all dangerous anomalies. The left sector consists of the fermion, gauge and scalar fields of the SM, now minimally coupled to gravity. The right sector is a mirror image of the left, with distinct fields, except the metric and the $SU(2)$ gauge potentials. The first new aspect is the proposed and motivated interpretation of the right sector as the dark matter one. The second new subject covered here is Weyl symmetry and its possible application to cosmology and its theoretical fallout on unitarity and renormalization of the model. A background solution of the Weyl invariant theory is derived, which may apply to the very early stages of the universe. This solution also suggests interesting applications to the cosmological constant problem. On the quantum field theory side the subject of Weyl symmetry and Weyl anomalies is reviewed and, among other things, an application of the WZ terms is illustrated to the problem of one-loop quantization of the model which may avoid negative norm states.</description>

      <title>NLIE formulations for the generalized Gibbs ensemble in the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose two sets of nonlinear integral equations (NLIE) for describing the thermodynamics in the sine-Gordon model, when higher Lorentz spin conserved charges are also coupled to the Gibbs ensemble. We call them NLIE I and II. The derivation of the equations, is based on T-Q relations given by the equivalent thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) formulation of the problem in the repulsive regime. Though the equations are derived in the repulsive regime at discrete values of the coupling constant, a straightforward analytical continuation ensures their validity within the whole repulsive regime of the theory. For the NLIE I formulation, appropriate analytical continuation makes the penetration into the attractive regime also possible. However, the magnitude of this penetration is restricted by the spin of the largest spin conserved charge contained in the Gibbs ensemble. Within their range of validity, these NLIE formulations provide efficient theoretical frameworks for computing expectation values of conserved charge densities, their associated currents, and vertex operators and their descendants, with respect to the generalized Gibbs ensemble.</description>

      <title>Group Representations of Lorentz Transformations Extended to Superluminal Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an extension of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group that includes space-time transformations for observers moving with superluminal relative velocities in arbitrary direction. This extension is generated by a realization of the Klein four group depending on polar and azimuthal angles identifying a spatial direction and is obtained with matrices representing infinite velocity limits of superluminal Lorentz boosts. The resulting group has the same identity component of the whole Lorentz group O(3,1) but involutive operators corresponding to an infinite speed boost and its negative in place of parity and time reversal. Different spatial directions in the definition of Klein group realization give rise to equivalent group extensions. We then define the extended Poincare group including translations and classify its unitary irreducible representations (UIRs). The resulting UIRs are induced from Wigner's UIRs of standard Poincare group and depend on the action of the extended Lorentz group defined on momentum space. UIRs corresponding to non lightlike orbits restrict to the ordinary Poincare subgroup as a multiplicity one direct sum of a massive forward, a massive backward and a tachyonic Wigner UIR while for lightlike orbits as a multiplicity one direct sum of a forward and backward massless Wigner UIR. We then derive wave equations corresponding to solutions of the Casimir eigenvalue problem of Poincare algebra obtained differentiating the above representations. This set of equations contains all the wave equations known to date in quantum field theory together with new wave equations describing tachyonic behaviour and a new class of massless representations. We finally show that tachyonic wave functions provide a relevant representation theoretic tool for interpretation of parity violation phenomena in quantum field theory</description>

      <title>Complex Saddles of Charged-AdS Gravitational partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Euclidean partition function of charged and uncharged AdS black hole geometries in (d+1)-dimensions. It is seen that the partition function can be reduced to a one-dimensional integral, which can be investigated using methods of Picard-Lefschetz. The saddles of the system correspond to either naked-singular geometry, thermal-AdS, small-, intermediate- or large-sized black hole for different ranges of parameter space. These are solutions of Einstein's equation, which are dominant saddles in the partition function in various regimes of parameter space. A naive analysis of the partition function involving these saddles would lead to conflicts with the standard understanding of black hole thermodynamics and also with AdS/CFT. However, when the partition function is analysed using Picard-Lefschetz, it is seen that naked-singular geometries don't contribute. The saddles corresponding to them are irrelevant, aligning well with the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. Saddles corresponding to negative specific heat are either small- or intermediate-sized black holes. Although they are relevant in the partition function but are sub-dominant. They also drop out under homology averaging. Saddles corresponding to only non-negative specific heat contribute to the Euclidean partition function. Finally, we analyze the allowability of these complex geometries using the KSW criterion.</description>

      <title>Central Singularity of Three-Dimensional Kerr-de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space-time, we find the singular energy-momentum and spin tensor sources that generate the non-trivial geometry. The energy-momentum tensor is symmetric, conserved and compatible with a spinning massive point particle whose mass and angular velocity we determine. The calculation is based on the analysis of the holonomy for a closed loop around the singularity of the $SO(1,3)$ Chern-Simons gauge field appropriate for gravity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant. This holonomy is related, via the non-abelian Stokes theorem, to the singular source terms at the center. Our results may be helpful for a better understanding of the algebra of observables of a local observer in the Kerr-de Sitter space-time.</description>

      <title>Matter Sourced Bubble Nucleation in the Asymmetron Scalar-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how matter density distributions affect thin-wall bubble formation in the asymmetron mechanism, a scalar-tensor theory with a universal coupling to matter and explicit symmetry-breaking, and analyse the stability of its metastable state. We show that the screening mechanism of the asymmetron inside dense objects induces a surface tension associated with the boundary of the screening object, leading to a richer class of bubble solutions than the standard Coleman-Callan bulk nucleation. These boundary surface tensions are used to modify the Nambu-Goto action for instantons, allowing for the computation of the corresponding Euclidean action for bubbles nucleating on flat planes, as well as on concave and convex cylindrical surfaces. We find that the smallest Euclidean action occurs for bubbles nucleating along the edge of a concave spherical surface. Comparing this edge nucleation channel with the bulk one, we determine the maximum curvature radius for which concave edge nucleation is preferred. Since the maximum radius of curvature is exponentially suppressed by the action of a bulk bubble, we find that within the regime of the instanton approximation, edge nucleation is always preferred. This is largely due to the weak couplings of the asymmetron. We apply these findings to determine the maximum curvature radius of a cosmic void and discuss how our results affect the seeding of $N$-body simulations of asymmetron domains, showing that domain wall nucleation preferentially occurs at the edges of cosmological voids. We also demonstrate that the presence of a homogeneous gas around the dense substrates reduces the maximum curvature radius, enabling bulk bubbles to form preferentially as the asymmetron undergoes a density-driven phase transition.</description>

      <title>Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity in 3D: Thermodynamics of cosmological solutions and black holes with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct generalized sets of asymptotic conditions for both three-dimensional Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity and a novel extension that incorporates torsion through a deformation of the Maxwell algebra. These boundary conditions include the most general temporal components of the gauge fields that consistently preserve the corresponding asymptotic Maxwell algebras with identical classical central charges, while allowing for the inclusion of chemical potentials conjugate to the conserved charges. We show that both sets of asymptotic configurations admit nontrivial solutions carrying not only mass and angular momentum but also an additional global spin-2 charge. In the torsionless case, the theory admits locally flat cosmological spacetimes, whereas in the presence of torsion, it generalizes to BTZ-like black hole geometries. For each case, the thermodynamic properties are consistently derived in terms of the gauge fields and the topology of the Euclidean manifold, shown to correspond to a solid torus. Furthermore, we obtain a general expression for the entropy, depending on both the horizon area and its spin-2 analogues, which can be written as a reparametrization-invariant integral of the induced spin-2 fields on the spacelike section of the horizon.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify and construct supersymmetric solutions of D=3, N=2 gauged supergravity extended with a Fayet-Iliopoulos term, and null, timelike, and warped AdS spacetimes are among them. From the first one, it is possible to obtain a well-defined black hole by periodic identification. We also find charged string solutions that interpolate between two supersymmetric AdS or Minkowski extrema of the scalar potential, one of which corresponds to a horizon with a singularity behind it, and the other determines the asymptotic geometry.</description>

      <title>Conformal Blocks in 2d Carrollian/Galilean CFTs and Excited State Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advance the study of flat space holography by computing the entanglement entropy of highly excited states in two-dimensional Carrollian/Galilean Conformal Field Theories (C/G CFTs). Our approach is centered on a novel, physically intuitive derivation of the heavy-light conformal block in the large central charge limit, where the backreaction of heavy operators is absorbed by a C/G conformal coordinate transformation. Using this result and the replica trick, we find that the entanglement entropy of highly excited states assumes a thermal form, providing a concrete realization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). This field-theoretic result perfectly reproduces the holographic entanglement entropy computed via the swing surface proposal in three-dimensional Einstein gravity, for backgrounds corresponding to spinning particles and Flat Space Cosmological solutions. This agreement establishes a precise dictionary relating the weight $\Delta$ and charge $\xi$ of the boundary state to the mass $m$ and angular momentum $j$ of the dual spacetime, offering a powerful consistency check for the Flat/CCFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Timelike Holographic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the pseudo-entropy program, we investigate timelike subregion complexity within the holographic ``Complexity=Volume'' framework, extending the usual spatial constructions to Lorentzian boundary intervals. For hyperbolic timelike regions in AdS geometries, we compute the corresponding bulk volumes and demonstrate that, despite the Lorentzian embedding, the resulting subregion complexity remains purely real. We further generalize our analysis to AdS black brane geometries, where the extremal surfaces can either be constant-time hypersurfaces or penetrate the horizon. In all cases, the computed complexity exhibits the same universal UV divergences as in the spacelike case but shows no imaginary contribution, underscoring its causal and geometric origin. This stands in sharp contrast with the complex-valued pseudo-entropy and suggests that holographic complexity preserves a genuinely geometric and real character even under Lorentzian continuation.</description>

      <title>Hodge Structures of Complex Multiplication Type from Rational Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under certain assumptions, we show that unitary rational $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ conformal field theories together with a certain generating set of Cardy boundary states in the associated boundary conformal field theories give rise to rational Hodge structures of complex multiplication type. We argue that these rational Hodge structures for such rational conformal field theories arising from infrared fixed points of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ non-linear sigma models with Calabi-Yau target spaces coincide with the rational Hodge structures of the middle-dimensional cohomology of the target space geometry. This gives non-trivial evidence of the general expectation in the literature that rational $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric conformal field theories associated to Calabi-Yau target spaces yield middle dimensional cohomological rational Hodge structures with complex multiplication. We exemplify our general results with the $\mathcal{N}=2$ A-type minimal model series - which do not have a geometric origin as a non-linear sigma model - and with two explicit $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ Gepner models that correspond to particular non-linear sigma models with specific Calabi-Yau threefold target spaces.</description>

      <title>A new conformal gauge theory of vector-spinors and spin-3/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique off-shell fermionic gauge invariance of a vector-spinor field theory is found, and the invariant action is derived. The latter is Weyl invariant in any dimension in the massless limit, and it coincides with the singular point of the one-parameter family of Rarita-Schwinger Lagrangians. Pure gauge configurations are represented by gamma-trace vector-spinors, which can be gauged away in a global way. Previous claims that this theory is inconsistent are shown to be flawed, and the Velo-Zwanziger instability is proved to be absent. The theory propagates a massive spin-3/2 particle together with a spin-1/2 state whose mass is twice that of the j=3/2 mode. This physical prediction is derived in a consistent fashion both from the classical field equations in d=4 and from the causal construction of a gamma-traceless quantum vector-spinor field. The conformal anomaly is derived using known results for the heat kernel of non-minimal second-order operators, and it is shown that the a-anomaly has an opposite sign w.r.t. known results for lower spin fields.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of BCFW for ABJM Loop Integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the loop-level geometry of ABJM theory from the perspective of lightcone geometries in dual space. This geometry admits a natural fibration, where one of the loop variables can be naturally interpreted as living in a fiber for each fixed point of a lower-loop geometry. When varying the latter, this leads us to the definition of $L$-loop half-chambers, defined such that `half' of the $(L+1)$-loop fiber remains unchanged. We provide a full classification of these half-chambers, and demonstrate a surprising bijection between $n$-point $L$-loop half-chambers and $L$-loop Feynman diagrams for a cubic scalar theory with $n/2$ particles. Consequently, the sum over $L$-loop half-chambers that computes the $n$-point ABJM amplitude is in direct correspondence with the sum over $L$-loop Feynman diagrams that computes the $(n/2)$-point amplitude of $\text{Tr}(\phi^3)$ theory. These Feynman diagrams are also realised geometrically in the structure of the loop fibers. Furthermore, we argue that the half-chamber expansion is equivalent to the loop-level BCFW recursion for ABJM, which arises naturally from our geometric construction. Finally, we will illustrate how $L$-loop chambers emerge as the intersection of two $L$-loop half-chambers, and we provide concrete examples of this construction.</description>

      <title>Response of a Kerr black hole to a generic tidal perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15117v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the response, the real part of which provides the tidal Love numbers, for non-extremal as well as extremal Kerr black holes under generic tidal perturbations. Our results suggest that the static as well as dynamical (linear-in-frequency) Love numbers vanish for both Schwarzschild and slowly rotating (linear-in-angular momentum) Kerr black holes, under generic perturbations. The vanishing of static and dynamical Love numbers also holds for axisymmetric tidal perturbations of non-extremal and extremal Kerr black holes. In fact, even under generic tidal perturbations, the static Love numbers of Kerr black holes vanish identically. The only case with non-zero Love numbers corresponds to the non-axisymmetric dynamical tidal perturbations of Kerr black holes (to arbitrary order of angular momentum). We also demonstrate that the non-zero dynamical Love numbers, for both non-extremal and extremal Kerr black holes, get modified under the change of the sign of the spin-weight, for electromagnetic and gravitational tidal perturbations.</description>

      <title>Spectral functions in Minkowski quantum electrodynamics from neural reconstruction: Benchmarking against dispersive Dyson--Schwinger integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Minkowskian physics-informed neural network approach (M--PINN) is formulated to solve the Dyson--Schwinger integral equations (DSE) of quantum electrodynamics (QED) directly in Minkowski spacetime. Our novel strategy merges two complementary approaches: (i) a dispersive solver based on Lehmann representations and subtracted dispersion relations, and (ii) a M--PINN that learns the fermion mass function $B(p^2)$, under the same truncation and renormalization configuration (quenched, rainbow, Landau gauge) with the loss integrating the DSE residual with multi--scale regularization, and monotonicity/smoothing penalties in the spacelike branch in the same way as in our previous work in Euclidean space. The benchmarks show quantitative agreement from the infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV) scales in both on-shell and momentum-subtraction schemes. In this controlled setting, our M--PINN reproduces the dispersive solution whilst remaining computationally compact and differentiable, paving the way for extensions with realistic vertices, unquenching effects, and uncertainty-aware variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chart of nuclei could be enlarged with a branch describing neutron stars that are huge nuclei of a few solar masses held together by
  gravity force and sustained by the pressure due to the degenerate Fermi sea. We contend in this manuscript that yet another branch
  could be added: objects with a large weak charge, with masses around $10^{-3}$ solar masses and having radii of a few meters, very compact,
  only slightly larger than their Schwarzchild radius, and sustained by the pressure generated by the weak force due to $Z$ exchange.
  This interaction, insignificant in normal neutron stars, could become dominant when ultrahigh densities are reached due to the action of gravity
  and lead to stable configurations if the appropriate conditions are met. They would constitute a physical realization of the equation of state
  proposed by Zeldovich some decades ago.</description>

      <title>Accelerating behavior from dynamical system analysis parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed the dynamical system analysis to obtain the critical point in which, the value of the geometric and dynamical parameters satisfy the late-time cosmic behavior of the Universe. At the outset, the modified Friedmann equations have been reformulated into a system of coupled differential equations to ensure that the minimal set of equations required for a second-order $f(Q)$ gravity. Then these equations are solved numerically to constrain the parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and high-precision Pantheon$^+$ Type Ia Supernovae datasets are used to constrain the parameters. The evolution of key cosmological parameters indicates that the model exhibits quintessence-like behavior at present, with a tendency to converge towards the $\Lambda$CDM model at late-times. The dynamic system analysis provided the critical points that correspond to different phases of the Universe, which are analyzed in detail. The existence of a stable de Sitter attractor confirms the accelerating behavior of the model.</description>

      <title>How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the Wang-Wen-Witten symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, building on two recent advances in the study of fermionic TQFTs and related homotopy theory. The first is the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. The second, which we develop further in a planned sequel to this paper, is a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups, closely paralleling techniques from cobordism theory. By integrating supercohomology and cobordism methods within the recently developed categorical framework of fusion 2-categories, we provide a concrete and systematic route to constructing fermionic TQFTs with specified anomalies, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between anomaly realization, cobordism, and higher-categorical structures.</description>

      <title>A Euclidean Monte-Carlo-informed route to ground-state preparation for quantum simulation of scalar field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators hold great promise for studying real-time (Minkowski) dynamics of quantum field theories. Nonetheless, preparing non-trivial initial states remains a major obstacle. Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods yield ground-state spectra and static correlation functions that can, in principle, guide state preparation. In this work, we exploit this classical information to bridge Euclidean and Minkowski descriptions for a (1+1)-dimensional interacting scalar field theory. We propose variational ansatz families which achieve comparable ground-state energies, yet exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. By optimizing selected wavefunction moments with Monte-Carlo data, we obtain ansatzes that can be efficiently translated into quantum circuits. Our algorithmic cost analysis shows these circuits' gate complexity scales polynomially in system size. Our work paves the way for systematically leveraging classically-computed information to prepare initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature.</description>

      <title>The cosmological analysis of DES 3$\times$2pt data from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data using predictions from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we fit three two-point observables (3$\times$2pt), galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear, using the one-loop expressions for the projected angular correlation functions. We validate our pipeline against numerical simulations and we check for several internal consistencies before applying it to the observational data. Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\pm 0.032$, $\Omega_m = 0.272\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\%$, $8.1\%$, and $6.3\%$, at $68\%$CL, respectively. While our results are consistent within $\lesssim 2\sigma$ with those from Planck and the BOSS full-shape analyses, they exhibit stronger tension with those from DES collaboration 3$\times$2pt analysis combined with a Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis prior, highlighting the impact of modeling, scale cuts, and choice of prior. The theory code and likelihood used for our analyses, \texttt{PyFowl}, is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Isotensor $\pi\pi \pi$ scattering with a $\rho$ resonant subsystem from QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) determination of $\pi\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes for the isospin-2 channel with angular momentum and parity $J^{P} = 1^+$. The calculation is performed using unphysically heavy light-quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_{\pi} \approx 400$~MeV, for which the $\rho$ meson manifests as a narrow resonance. The analysis employs a previously developed formalism that non-perturbatively relates the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems to their infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We combine earlier lattice QCD results for $\pi\pi$ systems with isospins 1 and 2 with new determinations of the isospin-2 three-pion finite-volume spectrum, obtained for three cubic, periodic lattice volumes with box length ranging from $\approx 4/m_\pi$ to $6/m_\pi$. These combined data constrain the low-lying partial waves of the infinite-volume three-pion K matrix, from which we solve a set of coupled integral equations to extract the corresponding scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Observable signature of magnetic tidal coupling in hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study hierarchical triple systems formed by a compact binary orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on the role of relativistic magnetic tidal interactions. Extending previous analyses of precession resonances to 0.5 post-Newtonian order, we incorporate quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, which have no Newtonian counterpart. Averaging the Hamiltonian over the inner orbit, we find that magnetic tides introduce new resonances absent at lower order, leading to additional eccentricity excitations and significantly modifying the binary's long-term evolution. Numerical solutions of the Lagrange Planetary Equations confirm these analytical predictions and reveal how resonance strength depends on orbital eccentricity and inclination. The resulting dynamics accelerates the binary merger and imprint distinctive signatures on gravitational waves, potentially observable by LISA. Our findings identify magnetic tidal coupling as a novel strong-gravity effect and establish its importance for the resonant dynamics of compact-object binaries near SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Midisuperspacetime foam and the cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard quantum field theory arguments predict an enormous cosmological constant. But what would this mean observationally? For a homogeneous universe the answer is clear, but if the universe is inhomogeneous at the Planck scale, the question becomes more subtle: for a large class of initial data, rapidly expanding and contracting regions coexist and give an average expansion near zero. Classically, such data develop singularities, and we need a quantum description of their evolution. I describe results from a spherically symmetric midisuperspace model, in which the wave function can become trapped for long periods in regions in which the average expansion remains small, effectively hiding a large cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational waves in EMRIs: supermassive black hole affected by galactic dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two parameters -- the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole results. For the different dark matter halo models, the NFW and Beta models produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows distinctly different effects. These findings enhance our understanding of dark matter halo effects on gravitational wave signatures and may provide constraints for future space-based detectors.</description>

Abstract: Let $A=A_{G,N}^{\hbar=1}$ be a quantized Coulomb branch with an antilinear automorphism $\rho$. A map $T\colon A\to\mathbb{C}$ is called a positive trace if $T(a\rho(a))&gt;0$ for all nonzero $a\in A$. Positive traces on Coulomb branches appear in the study of supersymmetric gauge theories. We classify positive traces on all abelian Coulomb branches, meaning $G=(\mathbb{C}^{\times})^d$ is a torus.</description>

      <title>Ringdown in Vaidya spacetimes: time-dependent frequencies, Penrose limit and time-domain analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the possible characterization of ringdown waves in a dynamical Vaidya spacetime using the Penrose limit geometry around the dynamical photon sphere. In the case of a static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, it is known that the quasinormal frequency in the eikonal limit can be characterized by the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent for the null geodesic congruence on the orbit of the unstable circular null geodesic. This correspondence can be further backed up by the analysis of the Penrose limit geometry around the unstable circular null geodesic orbit. We try to extend this analysis to a Vaidya spacetime, focusing on the dynamical photon sphere in it. Then we discuss to what extent the Penrose limit geometry can be relevant to the ringdown waves in the Vaidya spacetime, comparing the results with the numerically calculated waveform in the Vaidya spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25081v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD chiral phase transition at finite temperature and finite baryon density using the functional Renormalization Group (fRG). While conventional fRG studies often employ techniques such as dynamical bosonization to regularize divergences, we instead pursue the weak solution of the fRG equations which allows for non-analytic behavior in the flow to compute the pure fermionic potential $V_k(\psi,\bar{\psi})$ within the local potential approximation. This approach enables us to explore the effects of purely quark-level fluctuations on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking without introducing any auxiliary bosonic fields. Based on this framework, we present the resulting chiral phase diagram as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of polar core vortices in the easy plane phase of an atomic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a two-dimensional disc potential. A single vortex moves radially outward due to its interaction with background flows that arise from boundary effects. Pairs of opposite sign vortices, which tend to attract, move either radially inward or outward, depending on their strength of attraction relative to boundary effects. Pairs of same sign vortices repel. Spiral vortex dynamics are obtained for same-sign pairs in the presence of a finite axial magnetization. We quantify the dynamics for a range of realistic experimental parameters, finding that the vortex dynamics are accelerated with increasing quadratic Zeeman energy, consistent with existing studies in planar systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study vorticity-induced effects arising from the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms for Nambu-Goldstone modes in chiral perturbation theory. We first provide an alternative derivation of the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms in the presence of external vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar fields using a derivative expansion of the fermion determinant. We then employ the previously found correspondence in which vorticity is treated as an axial-vector field coupled to Dirac fermions in flat spacetime. Using this, we derive vorticity-induced contributions for Nambu-Goldstone modes in the presence of electromagnetic fields at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials, including a vorticity-induced current, a magnetic-field-induced angular momentum, and a vorticity-modified photon-pion coupling. We also briefly discuss the phenomenological implications of these vorticity-induced effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short review discusses recent applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to the flavor problem in particle physics. Traditional approaches to fermion masses and mixing often rely on extensions of the Standard Model based on horizontal symmetries, but the vast landscape of possible models makes systematic exploration infeasible. Recent works have shown that RL can efficiently navigate this landscape by constructing models that reproduce observed quark and lepton observables. These approaches demonstrate that RL not only rediscovers models already proposed in the literature but also uncovers new, phenomenologically acceptable solutions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universal features of chiral symmetry breaking in large-$N$ QCD by comparing non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying Dirac spectrum with chiral Random Matrix Theory (RMT) predictions. Our numerical Monte Carlo calculations are based on a chiral lattice discretization of the Dirac operator, and exploit twisted volume reduction to reach $N$ as large as 841. Matching lattice data with RMT analytic results, we are able to extract the large-$N$ chiral condensate, which is compared with a recent determination obtained with non-chiral Wilson quarks from twisted volume-reduced models.</description>

      <title>Morphological Zoo of Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectra imprinted by a Sequence of Post-Inflationary Epochs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w&lt;1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}&lt;0$), while a stiff EoS ($w&gt;1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}&gt;0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>A Light-Cone Approach to Higher-Order Cosmological Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses available in the literature. In particular, we investigate the gauge transformations of second-order perturbative quantities on the light-cone and establish their connection with standard perturbation theory. Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at second order.</description>

Abstract: We study a recently discovered property of many-body quantum chaotic systems called ETH-monotonicity in two-dimensional systems. Our new results further support ETH-monotonicity in these higher dimensional systems. We show that the flattening rate of the $f$-function is directly proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the system, so as $L^2$ where $L$ is the linear size of the system, and in general, expected to be $L^d$ where $d$ is the spatial dimension of the system. We also show that the flattening rate is directly proportional to the particle (or hole) number for systems of same spatial size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of symmetries and Gaussianity in bosonic systems, under closed and open dynamics, and develop a resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry. Specifically, we focus on Gaussian symmetry-respecting (covariant) operations, which serve as the free operations in this framework. We prove that any such operation can be realized via Gaussian Hamiltonians that respect the symmetry under consideration, coupled to an environment prepared in a symmetry-respecting pure Gaussian state. We further identify a family of tractable monotone functions of states that remain non-increasing under Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics, and are exactly conserved in closed systems. We demonstrate that these monotones are not generally respected under non-Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics. Along the way, we provide several technical results of independent interest to the quantum information and optics communities, including a new approach to the Stinespring dilation theorem, and an extension of Williamson's theorem for the simultaneous normal mode decomposition of Gaussian systems and conserved charges.</description>

Abstract: The global magnificent four theory is the homological version of a maximally supersymmetric $(8+1)$-dimensional gauge theory on a Calabi-Yau fourfold fibered over a circle. In the case of a toric fourfold we conjecture the formula for its twisted Witten index. String-theoretically we count the BPS states of a system of $D0$-$D2$-$D4$-$D6$-$D8$-branes on the Calabi-Yau fourfold in the presence of a large Neveu-Schwarz $B$-field. Mathematically, we develop the equivariant $K$-theoretic DT4 theory, by constructing the four-valent vertex with generic plane partition asymptotics. Physically, the vertex is a supersymmetric localization of a non-commutative gauge theory in $8+1$ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We use the language of von Neumann subfactors to investigate non-invertible symmetries in two dimensions. A fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$, its module category $\mathcal{M}$, and a gauging labeled by an algebra object $\mathcal{A}$ are encoded in the bipartite principal graph of a subfactor. The dual principal graph captures the quantum symmetry $\mathcal{C}'$ obtained by gauging $\mathcal{A}$ in $\mathcal{C}$, as well as a reverse gauging back to $\mathcal{C}$. From a given subfactor $N \subset M$, we derive a quiver diagram that encodes the representations of the associated non-invertible symmetry. We show how this framework provides necessary conditions for admissible gaugings, enabling the construction of generalized orbifold groupoids. To illustrate this strategy, we present three examples: Rep$(D_4)$ as a warm-up, the higher-multiplicity case Rep$(A_4)$ with its associated generalized orbifold groupoid and triality symmetry, and Rep$(A_5)$, where $A_5$ is the smallest non-solvable finite group. For applications to gapless systems, we embed these generalized gaugings as global manipulations on the conformal manifolds of $c=1$ CFTs and uncover new self-dualities in the exceptional $SU(2)_1/A_5$ theory. For $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric TQFTs, we use the subfactor-derived quiver diagrams to characterize gapped phases, describe their vacuum structure, and classify the recently proposed particle-soliton degeneracies.</description>

Abstract: We reformulate tree-level amplitudes in open superstring theory (type-I) in terms of stringy Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes with various kinematical shifts in the "curve-integral" formulation: while the bosonic-string amplitude with $n$ pairs of "scaffolding" scalars comes from a particularly simple shift of the Tr$(\phi^3)$ one (corresponding to $n$ length-$2$ cycles), the analogous superstring amplitude requires "correction" terms given by bosonic-string amplitudes with longer, even-length "cycles", which are also Tr$(\phi^3)$ ones at shifted kinematics dictated by the cycles; in total it is expressed as a sum of $(2n{-}3)!!$ shifted amplitudes originated from the expansion of a reduced Pfaffian. Upon taking $n$ scaffolding residues, this leads to a new formula of the $n$-gluon superstring amplitude, which is manifestly symmetric in $n{-}1$ legs, as a gauge-invariant combination of mixed bosonic string amplitudes with gluons and scalars, which come from length-$2$ cycles and longer ones respectively (the total sum is associated with the expansion a $n\times n$ symmetrical determinant); the corresponding prefactors are nested commutators of $2n$-gon kinematical variables, which nicely become traces of field-strengths for those legs corresponding to scalars in the mixed amplitudes. These interesting linear combinations of bosonic string amplitudes must guarantee the cancellation of tachyon poles and $F^3$ vertices ${\it etc.}$, and they give new relations between the superstring amplitude and its bosonic-string building blocks to all orders in the $\alpha'$ expansion (the first order gives a new formula for gluon amplitudes with a single $F^3$ insertion in terms of Yang-Mills-scalar amplitudes). We provide both the worldsheet and "curve-integral" derivations, and discuss applications to heterotic and type II cases.</description>

      <title>Stable non-linear evolution in regularised higher derivative effective field theories</title>

Abstract: We study properties of a recently proposed regularisation scheme to formulate the initial value problem for general (relativistic) effective field theories (EFTs) with arbitrary higher order equations of motion. We consider a simple UV theory that describes a massive and a massless scalar degree of freedom. Integrating out the heavy field gives rise to an EFT for the massless scalar. By adding suitable regularising terms to the EFT truncated at the level of dimension-$4$ and dimension-$6$ operators, we show that the resulting regularised theories admit a well-posed initial value problem. The regularised theories are related by a field redefinition to the original truncated EFTs and they propagate massive ghost fields (whose masses can be chosen to be of the order of the UV mass scale), in addition to the light field. We numerically solve the equations of motion of the UV theory and those of the regularised EFTs in $1+1$-dimensional Minkowski space for various choices of initial data and UV mass parameter. When derivatives of the initial data are sufficiently small compared to the UV mass scale, the regularised EFTs exhibit stable evolution in the computational domain and provide very accurate approximations of the UV theory. On the other hand, when the initial gradients of the light field are comparable to the UV mass scale, the effective field theory description breaks down and the corresponding regularised EFTs exhibit ghost-like/tachyonic instabilities. Finally, we also formulate a conjecture on the global nonlinear stability of the vacuum in the regularised scalar EFTs in $3+1$ dimensions. These results suggest that the regularisation approach provides a consistent classical description of the UV theory in a regime where effective field theory is applicable.</description>

Abstract: We use analytic (super-)conformal bootstrap methods to derive explicit expressions for the structure constants of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Liouville CFT in the `timelike' regime of the superconformal central charge. The obtained expressions take the form of inverses of the appropriate spacelike counterparts, which we explain concretely by elucidating the analytic properties of the corresponding shift relations in the NS- and R-sectors for the normalization-independent bootstrap data on the sphere. In a particular normalization, the timelike structure constants are shown to agree with the OPE coefficients of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Minimal Models when specified at degenerate values of the momenta, exactly as in the non-supersymmetric case. We discuss possible applications of our results, with emphasis on the construction of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric analog of the Virasoro Minimal String.</description>

      <title>Classification of Feynman integral geometries for black-hole scattering at 5PM order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the Feynman integral geometries relevant to the scattering of two black holes at fifth order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, i.e. at four loops. The analysis includes integrals relevant to both the conservative and dissipative dynamics, as well as to all orders in the self-force (SF) expansion, i.e. the 0SF, 1SF and 2SF orders. By relating the geometries of integrals across different loop orders and integral families, we find that out of the 16,596 potentially contributing integral topologies, only 70 need to be analyzed in detail. By further computing their leading singularities using the loop-by-loop Baikov representation, we show that there only appear two different three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries and two different K3 surfaces at this loop order, which together characterize the space of functions beyond polylogarithms to which the 5PM integrals evaluate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the restoration of the residual gauge symmetry in the Yang-Mills theory to be regarded as a confinement criterion. For this purpose we restrict the four-dimensional $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills instantons to those with spatial spherical symmetry $SO(3)$, which automatically causes the dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory to the two-dimensional $U(1)$ gauge-scalar theory as implemented explicitly by the Witten transformation. In this setting, we show that the restoration of the residual gauge symmetry occurs due to condensations of instantons and anti-instantons, although the residual gauge symmetry was spontaneously broken in the perturbative vacuum. This result demonstrates that the true confinement phase is a disordered phase in which all internal electric symmetries of the gauge field remain unbroken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a novel BCFW-like recursion relation for tree-level non-linear sigma model (NLSM) amplitudes, which circumvents the computation of boundary terms by exploiting the recently discovered hidden zeros. Using this recursion, we reproduce three remarkable features of tree-level NLSM amplitudes: (i) the Adler zero, (ii) the $\delta$-shift construction, which generates NLSM amplitudes from ${\rm Tr}(\phi^3)$ amplitudes, and (iii) the universal expansion of NLSM amplitudes into bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the hidden zeros, combined with standard factorization on physical poles, uniquely determine all tree-level NLSM amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantization of a single unstable mode in a real scalar field subject to a Robin boundary condition in (1+1)-dimensional half-Minkowski spacetime. The instability arises from an imaginary frequency mode - analogous to that of the inverted harmonic oscillator - requiring the rigged Hilbert space formalism for consistent quantization. Within this framework, the unstable mode is naturally described as a well-defined decaying (or growing) quantum state with a characteristic mean lifetime. We investigate its physical consequences via the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector along static, inertial, and uniformly accelerated trajectories. For static and inertial observers, the detector response exhibits a Breit-Wigner resonance profile, with a decay width determined by the unstable frequency and a Doppler factor. In the Neumann limit, infrared divergences emerge from arbitrarily low-frequency modes. Interestingly, for accelerated detectors, the response acquires a nontrivial dependence on acceleration, and the Neumann limit yields a finite, oscillatory signal rather than a divergence, suggesting that acceleration can act as an effective infrared regulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantum decoherence and entropy increase in early universe cosmology. We first study decoherence in a discrete bipartite quantum system for which a single qubit gets entangled with an environment and the entropy increase is correlated with the decay of the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix. We compare this system with continuous systems relevant for cosmology for which there is a natural external intervention, corresponding to the time-dependent separation between the sub- and super-horizon inflationary fluctuations. We find, in this case, that the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix, in a field basis, do not decay as sometimes assumed in cosmological set-ups. Nevertheless, following a recent treatment in terms of open Effective Field Theories (EFTs), we compute the entanglement entropy for a Gaussian state and show that it actually increases monotonically ($\dot S&gt;0$) during the accelerated phases ($\ddot a&gt;0$ with $a(t)$ the scale factor). We generalise this result to include non-Gaussian states and briefly discuss the relevance of computing the von Neumann entropy as compared to the thermodynamic entropy.</description>

Abstract: We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the $R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln |c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$, and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples. Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of spherically symmetric, charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Compared to Einstein's theory of gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity introduces higher-order curvature terms. The coupling constants of these higher-order curvature terms $\alpha$ can serve as new thermodynamic quantities, which will also be dual to thermodynamic quantities on the boundary CFT, a feature not present in the CFT dual to Einstein's gravity previously. Based on the holographic dictionary, we studied the critical behavior and phase transition of the CFT description of the charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in $d=4$ and $d=5$ in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$. The interesting behaviour of free energy stems from the fact that the constraints we introduced to handle the gravitational constant on CFT and the AdS radius differ from conventional approaches. Using the criticality equation, we numerically found the critical points of the zeroth-order and first-order phase transition for $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}$. The relationships between conjugate thermodynamic pairs (equation of state) were also examined. In the case of the $p-\mathcal{V}$, $\tilde{T}-\tilde{S}$ and $\tilde{\Phi}-\tilde{Q}$ conjugate pairs, characteristics that are analogous to the first-order phase transition of van der Waals fluids were found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a soft theorem at leading and subleading orders within the context of BFSS matrix theory. Specifically, we consider the effective field theory describing interactions between bound states of D0-branes at leading order, which are dual to supergraviton interactions in the eleven-dimensional target space. This theory is obtained from BFSS theory by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom in the large-distance limit at one loop. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that when treated as a one-dimensional quantum field theory with a UV cutoff, the theory is super-renormalizable and all Feynman diagrams converge. Our main result shows that the theory admits vertex-like operators with the correct quantum numbers to represent supergravitons in target space and that their correlation functions exhibit soft factorisation at both leading and subleading orders.</description>

Abstract: We will analyze through a first order perturbative formulation the local loss of symmetry when a source of electromagnetic and gravitational field interacts with an agent that perturbs the original geometry associated to the source. As the local gauge symmetry in Abelian or even non-Abelian field structures in four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes is displayed through the existence of local planes of symmetry that we will refer to as blades one and two, the loss of symmetry will be manifested by the tilting of these planes under the influence of an external agent. In this strict sense the original local symmetry will be lost. We will be able to prove in this way that the new blades at the same point will correspond ''after the tilting generated by perturbation" to a new symmetry. The purpose of this paper is to show that the geometrical manifestation of local gauge symmetries is dynamic. Despite the fact that the local original symmetries will be lost, new symmetries will arise. A dynamic evolution of local symmetries will be evidenced. This result will produce a new theorem on dynamic symmetry evolution.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation reaction and energy extraction from black holes: The tail term cannot be ignored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation reaction in curved space and the dynamics of radiating charged particles. The equation of motion for such particles is the DeWitt-Brehme equation, and it contains a particularly complicated, non-local, tail term. It has been claimed that the tail term can be neglected in certain magnetized black hole spacetimes, and that radiation reaction may then lead to energy extraction ("orbital widening") in the absence of an ergoregion. We show that such claims are incorrect, at least in the Newtonian limit: the tail term can never be neglected consistently in the relevant scenarios, and when it is included the reported energy extraction no longer occurs. Thus, previous results are called into question by our work.</description>

      <title>Learning the Renyi entropy of multiple disjoint intervals in transverse-field quantum Ising models with restricted Boltzmann machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals are computed from the improved swapping operations by two methods: one is from the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and the other one is from the state-of-the-art machine learning method with neural networks. We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model in one-dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping operation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Consequences of Domain Walls Biased by Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the simplest standard model extensions leading to a domain wall network is a real scalar $S$ with a $Z_2$ symmetry spontaneously broken during universe evolution. Motivated by the swampland program, we explore the possibility that quantum gravity effects are responsible for violation of the discrete symmetry, triggering the annihilation of the domain wall network. We explore the resulting cosmological implications in terms of dark radiation, dark matter, gravitational waves, primordial black holes, and wormholes connected to baby universes.</description>

      <title>Instability and Information Production Around Kerr Black Holes: Effects on Entropy and the Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit exponentially unstable motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. This exponentially unstable motion causes information production. In the case of the photons that escape to infinity, it was recently suggested that this information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black hole mass and spin. Here, we extend this method to obtain more precise results by including th non-equatorial contributions to the Lyapunov exponents. For massive particles plunging into the Kerr black hole, we show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics and obeys Bekenstein's bound on the entropy of a physical system. Thus, the perturbed unstable orbits, either ending inside the black hole or at the observer's screen, have physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Theoretical Method in Solving Zero-curvature Equations II--Non-Weyl Class Solutions of the Static Einstein-Maxwell Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gauge-theoretical method introduced in our previous paper is applied to solve the axisymmetric and static Einstein-Maxwell equations. We obtain the solutions of the non-Weyl class, where the gravitational and electric or magnetic potentials are not functionally related. In the electrostatic case, we show that the obtained solution coincides with the solution given by Bonnor in 1979. In the magnetostatic case, we present a solution describing the gravitational field created by two magnetically charged masses. In this solution, we present a case in which the Dirac string does not stretch to spatial infinity but lies between the magnetically charged masses.</description>

      <title>Strong-gravity precession resonances for binary systems orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary systems of compact objects in close orbit around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) may form in galactic nuclei, providing a unique environment to probe strong-gravity tidal effects on the binary's dynamics. In this work, we investigate precession resonances arising between the periastron precession frequency of a binary system and its orbital frequencies around the SMBH. By modeling the SMBH as a Schwarzschild black hole, we find that relativistic effects in the tidal field give rise to a significantly richer resonance spectrum compared to the Newtonian case. This result is supported by both perturbative and numerical analyses of the quadrupolar tidal interaction in the strong-gravity regime. Our results reveal new signatures for strong-gravity effects in such triple systems, with potential implications for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (like Wald extended solution valid in realistic astrophysical environment), we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. The induced EM field exhibits significantly different symmetries in contrast to the background EM field, which may serve as an indication of the existence of both an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling.</description>

      <title>Penrose process in magnetized non-Kerr rotating spacetime with anomalous quadrupole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic Penrose process in the Quevedo-Mashhoon spacetime, immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$. This metric is a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum solution to Einstein's equations with an arbitrary anomalous quadrupole moment ${\cal Q}$. A non-vanishing ${\cal Q}$ significantly modifies the near-horizon geometry, creating a multi-lobe ergoregion. Both ${\cal Q}$ and $B$ strongly influence the negative-energy region, which can extend well beyond the ergoregion, enabling the magnetic Penrose process to operate far from the ergoregion. Their combined effects allow energy extraction efficiency $\eta$ to far exceed that of the mechanical Penrose process. The maximum efficiency undergoes three distinct evolutionary stages as ${\cal Q}$ varies. In the absence of the magnetic field, efficiency is optimized for more negative ${\cal Q}$ (yielding a more oblate spacetime than Kerr). When electromagnetic interactions dominate, efficiency peaks when the infalling fragment's charge and $B$ share the same sign and ${\cal Q}$ is more positive (producing a more prolate spacetime than Kerr). These findings support the magnetic Penrose process as a theoretical framework for high-energy cosmic phenomena (e.g., extragalactic high-energy radiation) and as a tool to test the Kerr hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Planckian charged black holes and their cosmological ramifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of nonlinear electrodynamics at high energy scales has led to a variety of interesting phenomena in recent years, particularly within the context of non-singular spacetime geometries. Additionally, it is postulated that gravity near the Planck scale is governed by a minimal cut-off length, which acts as a renormalization scale against ultraviolet pathologies. Within this framework, we combine both concepts by introducing modifications to the electric and matter sectors of a black hole as its size approaches this minimal length. The result is an electrically charged black hole that is free from ultraviolet divergences and recovers the Maxwell limit at classical scales. We further explore the geometric and thermodynamic properties of the resulting solution within a cosmological anti-de Sitter background, revealing a chemical analogy with that of a Van der Waals fluid. Subsequently, we examine the charged black hole in de Sitter space and construct four corresponding gravitational instantons. We then study their cosmological quantum production using the formalism of the pair creation rate within the context of the no-boundary proposal.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Diagnostics for Complex Langevin Simulations: The Role of Configurational Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complex Langevin method (CLM) offers a potential solution to the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions, but can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable. Existing diagnostics monitor drift distributions or Langevin-time operators but do not explicitly test whether configurations are sampled with the correct Boltzmann statistical weight. We propose a complementary diagnostic based on configurational temperature, constructed from gradients and Hessians of the action. Testing in one-dimensional PT-symmetric models demonstrates 0.2-3\% accuracy in reproducing input temperatures. Crucially, configurational temperature detects algorithmic errors -- including noise mis-scaling, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization -- significantly more sensitively than existing drift-based or operator-based criteria. The method relies on the derivatives of the local action, making it applicable to general lattice theories, though computational cost requires consideration in higher dimensions. Our results suggest configurational temperature as a valuable addition to CLM diagnostics, complementing existing tools with potential applications from supersymmetric matrix models to lattice QCD at finite density.</description>

      <title>Applications of Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics to Specific Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)-a dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians coupled to entropy-induced dissipation-to paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium systems. Concretely, we construct NNET realizations for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (oscillatory), the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model (spiking), and the Lorenz and Chen systems (chaotic), and analyze their dynamical and thermodynamic signatures. Across all cases the velocity field cleanly decomposes into a reversible Nambu part and an irreversible entropygradient part, anchored by a model-independent quasi-conserved quantity. This construction reproduces cycles, spikes, and strange-attractor behavior and clarifies transitions among steady, periodic, and chaotic regimes via cross-model diagnostics. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified, quantitatively consistent framework for oscillatory, spiking, and chaotic non-equilibrium systems, offering a systematic description beyond the scope of linear-response theories such as Onsager's relations or GENERIC.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation, and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Mass and Decay-Constant Evolution of Heavy Quarkonia and $B_c$ States from Thermal QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the thermal behavior of heavy vector and axial-vector mesons ($J/\psi$, $\Upsilon$, and $B_c$) within the finite-temperature QCD sum-rule framework. Using updated PDG-2024 quark masses, modern lattice-informed gluon condensates, and a temperature-dependent continuum threshold constrained by vacuum stability, we compute the evolution of the masses $m(T)$ and decay constants $f(T)$ up to $T/T_c \lesssim 0.9$. The extracted zero-temperature limits reproduce experimental and LHCb values within 1\%. Near the critical temperature, the relative suppression follows a clear hierarchy $\Upsilon &lt; J/\psi &lt; B_c$, consistent with their binding energies and lattice spectral trends. The predicted $1P$--$1S$ splitting for the $B_c$ system, $0.477~\mathrm{GeV}$, matches the LHCb observation of orbitally excited $B_c^{+}$ states. The results provide a coherent finite-temperature baseline for future extensions including radiative, higher-dimensional, and width effects.</description>
