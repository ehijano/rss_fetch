      <title>An Asynchronous Distributed-Memory Parallel Algorithm for k-mer Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a new asynchronous algorithm and implementation for the problem of k-mer counting (KC), which concerns quantifying the frequency of length k substrings in a DNA sequence. This operation is common to many computational biology workloads and can take up to 77% of the total runtime of de novo genome assembly. The performance and scalability of the current state-of-the-art distributed-memory KC algorithm are hampered by multiple rounds of Many-To-Many collectives. Therefore, we develop an asynchronous algorithm (DAKC) that uses fine-grained, asynchronous messages to obviate most of this global communication while utilizing network bandwidth efficiently via custom message aggregation protocols. DAKC can perform strong scaling up to 256 nodes (512 sockets / 6K cores) and can count k-mers up to 9x faster than the state-of-the-art distributed-memory algorithm, and up to 100x faster than the shared-memory alternative. We also provide an analytical model to understand the hardware resource utilization of our asynchronous KC algorithm and provide insights on the performance.</description>

      <title>SUICA: Learning Super-high Dimensional Sparse Implicit Neural Representations for Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a method that captures gene expression profiles aligned with spatial coordinates. The discrete spatial distribution and the super-high dimensional sequencing results make ST data challenging to be modeled effectively. In this paper, we manage to model ST in a continuous and compact manner by the proposed tool, SUICA, empowered by the great approximation capability of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that can enhance both the spatial density and the gene expression. Concretely within the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to effectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide informative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also tackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification fashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of SUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms under varying degradations, SUICA outperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and bio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene signatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits subsequent analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/Szym29/SUICA.</description>
