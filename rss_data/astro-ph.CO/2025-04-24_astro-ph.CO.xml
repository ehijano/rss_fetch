      <title>Efficient simulation of discrete galaxy populations and associated radiation fields during the first billion years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the epochs of cosmic dawn and reionisation requires us to leverage multi-wavelength and multi-tracer observations, with each dataset providing a complimentary piece of the puzzle. To interpret such data, we update the public simulation code, 21cmFASTv4, to include a discrete source model based on stochastic sampling of conditional mass functions and semi-empirical galaxy relations. We demonstrate that our new galaxy model, which parametrizes the means and scatters of well-established scaling relations, is flexible enough to characterize very different predictions from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxies. Combining a discrete galaxy population with approximate, efficient radiative transfer allows us to self-consistently forward-model galaxy surveys, line intensity maps (LIMs), and observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Not only does each observable probe different scales and physical processes, but cross-correlation will maximise the information gained from each measurement by probing the galaxy-IGM connection at high-redshift. We find that a stochastic source field produces significant shot-noise in 21cm and LIM power spectra. Scatter in galaxy properties can be constrained using UV luminosity functions and/or 21cm power spectra, especially if astrophysical scatter is higher than expected (as might be needed to explain recent JWST observations). Our modelling pipeline is both flexible and computationally efficient, facilitating high-dimensional, multi-tracer, field-level Bayesian inference of cosmology and astrophysics during the first billion years.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of coupled dark energy and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers. In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions. We also compute the effective DM gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$ by using a quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the DE sound horizon and show that the existence of momentum and energy transfers allow a possibility to realize $G_{\rm eff}$ smaller than in the uncoupled case at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Free Cosmic Density Bispectrum on Small Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the free, cold-dark matter density fluctuation bispectrum in the limit of small scales. From an initially Gaussian random field, we draw phase-space positions of test particles which then propagate along Zel'dovich trajectories. A suitable expansion of the initial momentum auto-correlations of these particles leads to an asymptotic series whose lower-order power-law exponents we calculate. The dominant contribution has an exponent of $-11/2$. For triangle configurations with zero surface area, this exponent is even enhanced to $-9/2$. These power laws can only be revealed by a non-perturbative calculation with respect to the initial power spectrum. They are valid for a general class of initial power spectra with a cut-off function, required to enforce convergence of its moments. We then confirm our analytic results numerically. Finally, we use this asymptotic behaviour to investigate the shape dependence of the bispectrum in the small-scale limit, and to show how different shapes grow over cosmic time. These confirm the usual model of gravitational collapse within the Zel'dovich picture.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from self-resonant preheating in $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase, during which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When the potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum, these oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading to their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important implications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor perturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification results in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the production of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary models known as $\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\alpha \sim O(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly pronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.54$ for the T-model and $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the energy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which ultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r&gt;9.61\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r&gt;2.25\times10^{-6}$ for the E-model.</description>

      <title>Testing Quintessence Axion Dark Energy with Recent Cosmological Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quintessence axion model for dynamical dark energy, motivated in part by recent results from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). By carefully treating the initial conditions and parameter sampling, we identify a preferred parameter space featuring a sub-Planckian axion decay constant and a relatively large axion mass, which naturally avoids the quality problem and remains consistent with the perturbative string conjecture. Our parameter scan also uncovers a trans-Planckian regime of theoretical interest, which is only mildly disfavored by observations. The results remain robust when DESI BAO data are combined with CMB and supernova observations. Finally, we discuss the possible connection between this model and the recently reported non-zero rotation of the CMB linear polarization angle, emphasizing the broader cosmological implications and the promising prospects for testing this scenario. We show that an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ electromagnetic anomaly coefficient is preferred by the strongest constraint, which is in full agreement with the minimal quintessence axion model.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger standard-siren cosmology for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors: Considering observations of gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, GW multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. Extending the previous work, we explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimation by considering their associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, including $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) coincidence observations by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor and GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae by different optical survey projects. During an assumed 10-year observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is $\sim 4900$ with redshifts below $\sim 0.4$ under GW network and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in the $i$ band, which is three times more than that of GW-GRB detections. For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $0.034\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with precisions of $0.72\%$ and $0.99\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of precision cosmology. In conclusion, GW multi-messenger observations could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probing the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Pure Chromo-Natural Inflation: Signatures of Particle Production from Weak to Strong Backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider, in the context of axion-inflation, the \textit{Pure Natural Inflation} (PNI) model coupled with an SU(2) gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term. As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge sector thus sourcing fluctuations of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom therein. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational waves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming cosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from the CMB to laser interferometers. Due to their flat plateau at large field values, we find that PNI potentials fare better vis-\'{a}-vis CMB observations than the conventional sinusoidal potential of chromo-natural inflation (CNI). We show that, even when the dynamics begin in the weak backreaction regime, the rolling of the axion leads to a build-up of the gauge-quanta production, invariably triggering the strong backreaction of the gauge sector tensors on the background dynamics. This transition results in the copious production of both scalar and tensor perturbations, which we study in detail. The gravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a characteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the peak in scalar perturbations may lead to the formation of primordial black holes, potentially accounting for a significant fraction of the observed dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>WI2easy: warm inflation dynamics made easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present WI2easy, a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics, enabling efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials--including large-field, small-field, and hybrid models--and accommodates arbitrary dissipation coefficients dependent on temperature, field amplitude, or both, encompassing canonical forms prevalent in WI studies. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. This facilitates rapid confrontation of theoretical predictions with observational constraints, empowering systematic exploration of WI parameter spaces. WI2easy bridges the gap between theoretical models and observational cosmology, offering a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.</description>

      <title>Molecular Cloud Matching in CO and Dust in M33 I. High-Resolution Hydrogen Column Density Maps from Herschel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03601v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is aimed to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular hydrogen distribution in the galaxy M33 by introducing novel methods for generating high angular resolution (18.2$''$, equivalent to 75 pc) column density maps of molecular hydrogen ($N_{\rm H_2}$). M33 is a local group galaxy that has been observed with Herschel in the far-infrared wavelength range from 70 to 500 $\mu$m. Previous studies have presented total hydrogen column density maps ($N_{\rm H}$), using these FIR data (partly combined with mid-IR maps), employing various methods. We first performed a spectral energy distribution fit to the 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m continuum data obtain $N_{\rm H}$, using a technique similar to one previously reported in the literature. We also use a second method which involves translating only the 250 $\mu$m map into a $N_{\rm H}$ map at the same angular resolution. An $N_{\rm H_2}$ map via each method is then obtained by subtracting the HI component. Distinguishing our study from previous ones, we adopt a more versatile approach by considering a variable emissivity index, $\beta$ and dust absorption coefficient, $\kappa_0$. This choice enables us to construct a $\kappa_0$ map, thereby enhancing the depth and accuracy of our investigation of the hydrogen column density. We address the inherent biases and challenges within both methods (which give similar results) and compare them with existing maps available in the literature. Moreover, we calculate a map of the carbon monoxide CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($X_\mathrm{CO}$ factor), which shows a strong dispersion around an average value of $1.8\times10^{20}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}/(K\,km\,s^{-1})}$ throughout the disk. We obtain column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) from the $N_{\rm H}$, $N_{\rm H_2}$, and $N_{HI}$ maps and discuss their shape.</description>

      <title>Prospects for gravitational wave and ultra-light dark matter detection with binary resonances beyond the secular approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision observations of orbital systems have recently emerged as a promising new means of detecting gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter, offering sensitivity in new regimes with significant discovery potential. These searches rely critically on precise modeling of the dynamical effects of these signals on the observed system; however, previous analyses have mainly only relied on the secularly-averaged part of the response. We introduce here a fundamentally different approach that allows for a fully time-resolved description of the effects of oscillatory metric perturbations on orbital dynamics. We find that gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter can induce large oscillations in the orbital parameters of realistic binaries, enhancing the sensitivity to such signals by orders of magnitude compared to previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Stamps of state on structure: Probing the state of ultralight dark matter via its density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) candidates with very small masses, and correspondingly large number densities, have gained significant interest in recent years. These DM candidates are typically said to behave "classically". More specifically, they are often assumed to reside in an ensemble of coherent states. One notable exception to this scenario is when isocurvature fluctuations of the DM are produced during inflation (or more generally by any Bogoliubov transformation). In such contexts, the ultralight DM instead resides in a squeezed state. In this work, we demonstrate that these two scenarios can be distinguished via the statistics of the DM density fluctuations, such as the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. This provides a probe of the DM state which persists in the limit of large particle number and does not rely on any non-gravitational interactions of the DM. Importantly, the statistics of these two states differ when the modes of the squeezed state are all in-phase, as is the case at the end of inflation. Later cosmological dynamics may affect this configuration. Our work motivates future numerical studies of how cosmological dynamics may impact the initial squeezed state and the statistics of its density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Line-of-Sight Velocity Projection Impact on the Local Group Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass of the Local Group (LG), comprising the Milky Way (MW), Andromeda (M31), and their satellites, is crucial for validating galaxy formation and cosmological models. Traditional virial mass estimates, which rely on line-of-sight (LoS) velocities and simplified infall assumptions, are prone to systematic biases due to unobserved velocity components and anisotropic kinematics. Using the TNG cosmological simulation, we examine two limiting cases: the \underline{minor infall} model -- ignoring perpendicular velocities to the LoS directions) and the \underline{major infall} model -- assuming purely radial motion towards the Center of Mass (CoM). Our simulations demonstrate that geometric corrections are vital: the minor-infall model underestimates the true mass, while the major-infall model overestimates it. By applying these calibrated corrections to observed dwarf galaxy kinematics within 1 Mpc of the LG's CoM, we derive a refined LG mass of $M_{\mathrm{LG}} = (2.99 \pm 0.60) \times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. This finding aligns with predictions from the $\Lambda$CDM model, timing arguments, and independent mass estimates, resolving previous discrepancies. Our analysis highlights the importance of correcting for velocity anisotropy and offers a robust framework for dynamical mass estimation in galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Prospects of detecting cosmic ray up-scattered dark matter with DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles in direct detection experiments is inherently difficult, as their low kinetic energies in the galactic halo are insufficient to produce observable recoils of the heavy nuclei in the detectors. On the other hand, whenever DM particles interact with nucleons, they can be accelerated by scattering with galactic cosmic rays. These cosmic-ray-boosted DM particles can then interact not only through coherent elastic scattering with nuclei, but also through scattering with individual nucleons in the detectors and produce outgoing particles at MeV to GeV kinetic energies. The resulting signal spectrum overlaps with the detection capabilities of modern neutrino experiments. One future experiment is the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. Our study shows that DUNE has a unique ability to search for cosmic-ray boosted DM with sensitivity comparable to dedicated direct detection experiments in the case of spin-independent interactions. Importantly, DUNE's sensitivity reaches similar values of DM-nucleon cross sections also in the case of spin-dependent interactions, offering a key advantage over traditional direct detection experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for neutrino isocurvature usually constrain a specific linear combination of isocurvature perturbations. In this work, we discuss realistic cosmological scenarios giving rise to neutrino isocurvature. We show that in general both, neutrino and matter isocurvature perturbations are generated, whose ratio we parameterize by a newly introduced mixing angle. We obtain the first limits on this new mixing angle from PLANCK data, and discuss novel insights into the early Universe that could be provided by future measurements.</description>

      <title>Prospective sensitivity of CTA on detection of evaporating primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking radiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance through a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of $\sim 5\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end in the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling evidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the sensitivity of CTA to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTA could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding $\sim 36\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitational waves from cosmological horizon radiation during de Sitter period: as zero-order approximation of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the event horizon of the de Sitter universe can produce particles, and one can get sizable Hawking radiation by considering inflationary phases as de Sitter spacetimes with large Hubble rates. In this compact paper, we consider the graviton emission part of these radiations and assume that these graviton signals can exist in the current universe in the form of gravitational waves. We predict an energy density parameter of $\log_{10}(\Omega_{\rm GW} h^2) \sim \mathscr{O}(-25) - \mathscr{O}(-30)$ and its associated peak frequency $\log_{10}(f_{\rm peak}^0) \sim \mathscr{O}(6)-\mathscr{O}(5)$, depending on the reheating temperature. These signals occupy a frequency band below the ultrahigh-frequency regime and possess a detectable energy density, offering a promising target for future gravitational wave observatories. We believe that the detection of such signals would provide a compelling test of Hawking's radiation theory in a cosmological context.</description>

      <title>A negative stellar mass$-$gaseous metallicity gradient relation of dwarf galaxies modulated by stellar feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonic cycling is reflected in the spatial distribution of metallicity within galaxies, yet gas-phase metallicity distribution and its connection with other properties of dwarf galaxies are largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of radial gradients of gas-phase metallicities for a sample of 55 normal nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies (stellar mass $M_\star$ ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{9.5}\ M_\odot$), based on MUSE spectroscopic observations. We find that metallicity gradient shows a significant negative correlation (correlation coefficient $r \approx -0.56$) with $\log M_\star$, in contrast to the flat or even positive correlation observed for higher-mass galaxies. This negative correlation is accompanied by a stronger central suppression of metallicity compared to the outskirts in lower-mass galaxies. Among the other explored galaxy properties-including baryonic mass, star formation distribution, galaxy environment, regularity of the gaseous velocity field, and effective yield of metals $y_{\rm eff}$-only the velocity field regularity and $y_{\rm eff}$ show residual correlation with the metallicity gradient after controlling for $M_\star$, in the sense that galaxies with irregular velocity fields or lower $y_{\rm eff}$ tend to have less negative or more positive gradients. Particularly, a linear combination of $\log M_\star$ and $\log y_{\rm eff}$ significantly improves the correlation with metallicity gradient ($r \approx -0.68$) compared to $\log M_\star$ alone. The lack of correlation with environment disfavors gas accretion as a dominant factor. Our findings imply that metal mixing and transport processes, including but not limited to feedback-driven outflows, are more important than in-situ metal production in shaping the metallicity distribution of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the distribution of very rare, large excursions in the primordial density field produced in models of inflation in the very early universe which include a strong enhancement of the power spectrum. The stochastic $\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is used to identify the probability distribution for the primordial curvature perturbation with the first-passage-time distribution, $P(\delta \mathcal{N})$, and we compare our stochastic results with those obtained in the classical $\delta \mathcal{N}$ approach. We extend the PyFPT numerical code to simulate the full 2D phase space, and apply importance sampling which allows very rare fluctuations to be simulated in $\mathcal{O}(10)$ minutes on a single CPU, where previous direct simulations required supercomputers. We demonstrate that the stochastic noise due to quantum fluctuations after a sudden transition to ultra-slow roll can be accurately modelled using an analytical Bessel-function ansatz to identify the homogeneous growing mode. The stochastic noise found in this way is a function of the field value only. This enables us to coarse grain the inflation field at the Hubble scale and include non-linear, stochastic evolution on all super-Hubble length scales.</description>

      <title>Modulations of Gravitational Waves due to Non-static Gravitational Lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a new observational window into the universe, providing insights into compact objects and cosmic structures. Gravitational lensing, commonly studied in electromagnetic waves, also affects GWs, introducing magnification, time delays, and multiple images. While existing studies focus on static lenses, many astrophysical lenses are dynamic, with time-varying mass distributions such as moving stars or orbiting binaries. We develop a general theoretical framework to describe non-static lenses and demonstrate how they modulate GW signals, inducing unique time-varying amplitude modulations and spectral broadening. By examining uniformly moving and orbiting binary lenses, we show that these modulations provide new observational signatures, enhancing our understanding of lensing objects and the dynamics of the universe. Our findings have important implications for GW astronomy, offering novel ways to probe lens dynamics and improve the interpretations of GW signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a suite of the most recent cosmological observations to test models of dynamical dark energy motivated by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus on hilltop quintessence scenarios, able to satisfy theoretical constraints from quantum gravity. We discuss their realisation based on axions, their supersymmetric partners, and Higgs-like string constructions, including dynamical mechanisms to set up initial conditions at the hilltops. We also examine a specific parameterisation for dynamical dark energy suitable for hilltop quintessence. We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data. We show to what extent current data can distinguish amongst different hilltop set-ups, providing model parameter constraints that are complementary to and synergetic with theoretical bounds from quantum gravity conjectures, as well as model comparisons across the main dark energy candidates in the literature. However, all these constraints are sensitive to priors based on theoretical assumptions about viable regions of parameter space. Consequently, we discuss theoretical challenges in refining these priors, with the aim of maximizing the informative power of current and forthcoming cosmological datasets for testing dark energy scenarios in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in Pantheon+ supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ Maximum Likelihood Estimators to examine the Pantheon+ catalogue of Type Ia supernovae for large scale anisotropies in the expansion rate of the Universe. The analyses are carried out in the heliocentric frame, the CMB frame, as well as the Local Group frame. In all frames, the Hubble expansion rate in the redshift range 0.023 &lt; z &lt; 0.15 is found to have a statistically significant dipolar variation exceeding 1.5 km/s/Mpc, i.e. bigger than the claimed 1% uncertainty in the SH0ES measurement of the Hubble parameter H_0. The deceleration parameter too has a redshift-dependent dipolar modulation at &gt; 5 sigma significance, consistent with previous findings using the SDSSII/SNLS3 Joint Lightcurve Analysis catalogue. The inferred cosmic acceleration cannot therefore be due to a Cosmological Constant, but is likely a general relativistic effect due to the anomalous bulk flow in our local Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}$ - $10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $2\times10^{16}$ - $5\times10^{17}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Our results indicate that although Insight-HXMT does not have an advantage in the first two scenarios, when considering the power-law model, its exceptional sensitivity in the hard X-ray regime and sufficiently high upper energy limit significantly strengthen the constraints on PBHs with masses greater than $10^{17}$ g compared to previous limits. Furthermore, the exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter has reached $4\times10^{17}$ g, which is comparable to the current threshold.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Nonlinear Systematics in Weak Lensing Surveys: The Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak lensing surveys, along with most other late-Universe probes, have consistently measured a lower amplitude of the matter fluctuation spectrum, denoted by the parameter $S_8$, compared to predictions from early-Universe measurements in cosmic microwave background data. Improper modelling of nonlinear scales may partially explain these discrepancies in lensing surveys. This study investigates whether the conventional approach to addressing small-scale biases remains optimal for Stage-IV lensing surveys. We demonstrate that conventional weak lensing estimators are affected by scale leakage from theoretical biases at nonlinear scales, which influence all observed scales. Using the BNT transform, we propose an $\ell$-cut methodology that effectively controls this leakage. The Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform reorganises weak lensing data in $\ell$ space, aligning it with $k$ space, thereby reducing the mixing of nonlinear scales and providing a more accurate interpretation of the data. We evaluate the BNT approach by comparing HMcode, Halofit, Baryon Correction Model and AxionHMcode mass power spectrum models using Euclid-like survey configurations. Additionally, we introduce a new estimator to quantify scale leakage in both the BNT and noBNT approaches. Our findings show that BNT outperforms traditional methods, preserving cosmological constraints while significantly mitigating theoretical biases.</description>

      <title>Physical vs phantom dark energy after DESI: thawing quintessence in a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent data from DESI, in combination with other data, provide moderate evidence of dynamical dark energy, $w\neq-1$. In the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization of $w$, there is a preference for a phantom crossing, $w&lt;-1$, at redshift $z\sim0.5$. In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical. Thus it is important to check whether phantom crossing is present in other physically self-consistent models of dark energy that have equivalent evidence to the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization. We find that thawing quintessence with nonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data as well as $w_0, w_a$ in a flat background, based on both parametric and realistic scalar field evolutions. Although the realistic model does not allow $w&lt;-1$, the parametrizations do allow it. However even if we allow $w&lt;-1$ the data do not enforce phantom crossing. Thus, the phantom crossing is an artifact of a parametrization that is not based on a physical model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a scenario in which the expansion of the Early Universe is driven by a hot hidden sector (HS) with an initial temperature $T'$ that is significantly higher than that of the visible sector (VS), $T' \gg T$. The latter is assumed to be made of Standard Model (SM) particles and our main focus is on the possibility that dark matter (DM) is part of the dominant HS and that its abundance is set by secluded freeze-out. In particular, we study the subsequent evolution and fate of the DM companion particle after freeze-out all the way toward reheating of the VS. To make this scenario more concrete, we work within dark QED, a framework in which the DM is a Dirac fermion and its companion, a massive dark photon; coupling between the SM and HS is through kinetic mixing. We provide a detailed and comprehensive numerical and analytical analysis of the different regimes of reheating of the VS. Extending and complementing the work of Coy et al on the``Domain of thermal dark matter candidates", we use our results to explore the viable parameter space of both the DM matter particle and its companion, here the dark photon. We show that current and future fixed target experiments can probe scenarios along which the expansion was driven by relativistic DM photons, a scenario dubbed relativistic reheating. We also set new bounds on the maximal temperature ratio $T'/T$ and argue for an extension of the domain toward very large DM masses, $m_{\rm dm} \sim 10^{11}$ GeV. These are possible assuming that DM annihilation is bounded by unitarity and that reheating of the VS occurs just before big bang nucleosynthesis. We also discuss some possible implications for (and constraints on) baryogenesis, including simple leptogenesis mechanisms, and how they may set additional constraints on the domain of DM candidates.</description>

Abstract: The existence of solitons -- stable, long-lived, and localized field configurations -- is a generic prediction for ultralight dark matter. These solitons, known by various names such as boson stars, axion stars, oscillons, and Q-balls depending on the context, are typically treated as distinct entities in the literature. This study aims to provide a unified perspective on these solitonic objects for real or complex, scalar or vector dark matter, considering self-interactions and nonminimal gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that these solitons share universal nonrelativistic properties, such as conserved charges, mass-radius relations, stability and profiles. Without accounting for alternative interactions or relativistic effects, distinguishing between real and complex scalar dark matter is challenging. However, self-interactions differentiate real and complex vector dark matter due to their different dependencies on the macroscopic spin density of dark matter waves. Furthermore, gradient-dependent nonminimal gravitational interactions impose an upper bound on soliton amplitudes, influencing their mass distribution and phenomenology in the present-day universe.</description>

      <title>Mitigating cosmic variance in the Hellings-Downs curve: a Cosmic Microwave Background analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12073v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation, which characterizes the signature of a stochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), is derived using a harmonic formalism. This approach closely follows the framework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature fluctuations in the CMB. This parallel enables a direct comparison between the correlations observed in PTA and those in CMB. After providing analytic estimates of the transmission functions, we show that the covariance matrix in frequency space becomes very non-diagonal. We then build formally the quadratic estimator for the HD correlation in multipolar space, for both a perfect experiment, and for a realistic pulsar noise model. For a perfect experiment, we show that the SNR grows with the observation time and the number of frequency bins, in turn determined by the cadence of observation. For an imperfect experiment, the behaviour is similar, with an effective multipole-dependent number of frequency, obtained after weighting with noise. We predict that with $\sim 200$ pulsars monitored for $25$ years, multipoles of the HD correlation up to $\ell=4$ can be measured. Our findings clarify that is called \emph{cosmic variance} in previous literature is not an intrinsic limitation for PTA measurements. Instead, with optimal estimators, it can be mitigated by accumulating more observation time or improving the cadence of pulsar monitoring. Therefore, unlike CMB angular correlations, where cosmic variance represents an irreducible constraint, it can be reduced in PTA measurements. Finally, we show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations was very blue with $n_T&gt;4$, the CMB angular correlation due to these tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation. We also discuss the case in which the graviton distribution function is anisotropic.</description>

      <title>A new dark matter direct search based on archaeological Pb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12409v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The RES-NOVA project is an experimental initiative aimed at detecting neutrinos from the next galactic supernova using PbWO$_{4}$ cryogenic detectors, operated at low temperatures in a low-background environment. By utilizing archaeological lead (Pb) as the target material, RES-NOVA leverages its high radiopurity, large nuclear mass, and the natural abundance of $^{207}$Pb, making it well-suited for exploring both spin-independent and spin-dependent Dark Matter (DM) interactions via nuclear scattering. This work presents a background model developed for the RES-NOVA technology demonstrator and evaluates its implications for Dark Matter detection. Detailed calculations of nuclear matrix elements, combined with the unique properties of archaeological Pb, demonstrate RES-NOVA's potential as a complementary tool to existing direct detection experiments for studying Dark Matter interactions. The experiment will conduct DM searches over a broad mass range spanning 4 orders of magnitude, from sub-GeV/$c^2$ to TeV/$c^2$. In the most optimistic scenario, RES-NOVA is expected to probe DM-nucleon cross-sections down to 1$\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$ and 2$\times 10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for candidates with masses of 2 GeV/$c^2$ and 20 GeV/$c^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses - axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics - based on Airy function approximations - which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius - as it is in electromagnetic lensing - making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>Line Intensity Mapping Prediction from the Cosmic Dawn (CoDa) III Simulation for H$\alpha$ from Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium during the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of large-scale structure, galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) can be probed by upcoming Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiments, which sample in redshift and direction without needing to resolve individual galaxies. We predict the intensity and sources of hydrogen H$\alpha$ emission, dominated by radiative recombination following ionization by UV from the same massive stars that caused reionization, down to redshift 4.6, using the largest fully-coupled, radiation-hydro simulation of galaxy formation and reionization to date, Cosmic Dawn (CoDa) III. We compute the mean intensity and Voxel Intensity Distribution (VID) vs. redshift, including the relative contributions of galaxies and IGM. This will provide mock data to guide and interpret LIM experiments such as NASA's SPHEREx and proposed Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM).</description>

      <title>Matter-antimatter asymmetry in generalized coupling theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational baryogenesis paradigm in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology of generalized coupling gravity and, in particular, of the so-called Minimal Exponential Measure Model (MEMe). We show that, also in this theory, the time derivative of the Ricci scalar couples with matter currents and can preserve an unbalance in the baryon-antibaryon number beyond thermal equilibrium. Using the current bounds on the ratio of baryon number to entropy density, we can considerably improve the known constraints on the parameter q that characterizes the MEMe model. This estimate also allows us to draw stringent constraints on the spatial curvature of the cosmological model.</description>
