      <title>Investigation of low-energy electron scattering from ethylene glycol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethylene glycol is a prebiotically relevant complex organic molecule detected in interstellar and cometary environments, yet quantitative low-energy electron-ethylene glycol scattering data remain limited for astrochemical modeling. This work presents an R-matrix study of low-energy electron collisions with ethylene glycol over the 0 to 12 eV energy range, using static exchange (SE), static exchange plus polarization (SEP), and configuration interaction (CI) models with 6-311G* and cc-pVTZ basis sets. We compute elastic, excitation, and differential cross sections within a close coupling framework. The dataset offers benchmark inputs for astrochemical models, supporting interpretation of ethylene glycol abundances in space and refining constraints on electron-induced prebiotic pathways.</description>

      <title>Low-energy electron scattering from aminoacetonitrile using the R-matrix method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aminoacetonitrile occupies a prime importance in the interface between astrochemistry and prebiotic chemistry. Its detection in the ISM establishes it as part of the organic inventory of star-forming regions, while its role as a glycine precursor highlights its significance for origins-of-life scenarios. In this work, electron scattering from aminoacetonitrile has been studied using the R-matrix method in the low-energy range from 0 to 10 eV. The calculations were carried out within the C_s point group using static-exchange (SE), static-exchange plus polarization (SEP), and configuration interaction (CI) models, with two basis sets (6-311G* and cc-pVTZ). Various scattering observables such as elastic, excitation, momentum transfer, and differential cross sections were examined. Since aminoacetonitrile is a prebiotically relevant molecule, these findings provide valuable insight into electron-driven processes in complex organic systems and form a theoretical foundation for future work on electron-induced reactivity in prebiotic and astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA method generally produces larger Hubbard U interaction values compared to conventional approaches. When applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$ , s-cRPA yields interaction parameters that align more closely with those required within DFT+U to reproduce the experimentally observed insulating state, addressing the metallic behaviour predicted by standard density functionals. We examine the issue of negative interaction values encountered in the projec- tor cRPA method for filled d-shells. We show that s-cRPA provides improved numerical stability by preserving electron number conservation, a constraint that is violated in the projector cRPA method. The s-cRPA approach addresses some limitations of standard cRPA methods, particularly the tendency to underestimate U values, suggesting its potential utility for the community. Addi- tionally, we have enhanced our implementation to include computation of multi-centre interactions for analysing spatial decay and developed an efficient low-scaling variant employing a compressed Matsubara grid to obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>
