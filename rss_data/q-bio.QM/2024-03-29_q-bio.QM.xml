      <title>SAM-dPCR: Real-Time and High-throughput Absolute Quantification of Biological Samples Using Zero-Shot Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital PCR (dPCR) has revolutionized nucleic acid diagnostics by enabling absolute quantification of rare mutations and target sequences. However, current detection methodologies face challenges, as flow cytometers are costly and complex, while fluorescence imaging methods, relying on software or manual counting, are time-consuming and prone to errors. To address these limitations, we present SAM-dPCR, a novel self-supervised learning-based pipeline that enables real-time and high-throughput absolute quantification of biological samples. Leveraging the zero-shot SAM model, SAM-dPCR efficiently analyzes diverse microreactors with over 97.7% accuracy within a rapid processing time of 3.16 seconds. By utilizing commonly available lab fluorescence microscopes, SAM-dPCR facilitates the quantification of sample concentrations. The accuracy of SAM-dPCR is validated by the strong linear relationship observed between known and inferred sample concentrations. Additionally, SAM-dPCR demonstrates versatility through comprehensive verification using various samples and reactor morphologies. This accessible, cost-effective tool transcends the limitations of traditional detection methods or fully supervised AI models, marking the first application of SAM in nucleic acid detection or molecular diagnostics. By eliminating the need for annotated training data, SAM-dPCR holds great application potential for nucleic acid quantification in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Transmission IR Microscopy for the Quantitation of Biomolecular Mass In Live Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute quantity imaging of biomolecules on a single cell level is critical for measurement assurance in biosciences and bioindustries. While infrared (IR) transmission microscopy is a powerful label-free imaging modality capable of chemical quantification, its applicability to hydrated biological samples remains challenging due to the strong water absorption. We overcome this challenge by applying a solvent absorption compensation (SAC) technique to a home-built quantum cascade laser IR microscope. SAC-IR microscopy improves the chemical sensitivity considerably by adjusting the incident light intensity to pre-compensate the IR absorption by water while retaining the full dynamic range. We demonstrate the label-free chemical imaging of key biomolecules of a cell, such as protein, fatty acid, and nucleic acid, with sub-cellular spatial resolution. By imaging live fibroblast cells over twelve hours, we monitor the mass change of the three molecular species of single cells at various phases, including cell division. While the current live-cell imaging demonstration involved three wavenumbers, more wavenumber images could measure more biomolecules in live cells with higher accuracy. As a label-free method to measure absolute quantities of various molecules in a cell, SAC-IR microscopy can potentially become a standard chemical characterization tool for live cells in biology, medicine, and biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Sequential Inference of Hospitalization ElectronicHealth Records Using Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dynamic hospital setting, decision support can be a valuable tool for improving patient outcomes. Data-driven inference of future outcomes is challenging in this dynamic setting, where long sequences such as laboratory tests and medications are updated frequently. This is due in part to heterogeneity of data types and mixed-sequence types contained in variable length sequences. In this work we design a probabilistic unsupervised model for multiple arbitrary-length sequences contained in hospitalization Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The model uses a latent variable structure and captures complex relationships between medications, diagnoses, laboratory tests, neurological assessments, and medications. It can be trained on original data, without requiring any lossy transformations or time binning. Inference algorithms are derived that use partial data to infer properties of the complete sequences, including their length and presence of specific values. We train this model on data from subjects receiving medical care in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated healthcare delivery system. The results are evaluated against held-out data for predicting the length of sequences and presence of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in hospitalization bed sequences. Our method outperforms a baseline approach, showing that in these experiments the trained model captures information in the sequences that is informative of their future values.</description>

      <title>Real-time Geoinformation Systems to Improve the Quality, Scalability, and Cost of Internet of Things for Agri-environment Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing emphasis on machine learning and artificial intelligence to drive knowledge discovery in the agricultural sciences, spatial internet of things (IoT) technologies have become increasingly important for collecting real-time, high resolution data for these models. However, managing large fleets of devices while maintaining high data quality remains an ongoing challenge as scientists iterate from prototype to mature end-to-end applications. Here, we provide a set of case studies using the framework of technology readiness levels for an open source spatial IoT system. The spatial IoT systems underwent 3 major and 14 minor system versions, had over 2,727 devices manufactured both in academic and commercial contexts, and are either in active or planned deployment across four continents. Our results show the evolution of a generalizable, open source spatial IoT system designed for agricultural scientists, and provide a model for academic researchers to overcome the challenges that exist in going from one-off prototypes to thousands of internet-connected devices.</description>

      <title>Stability of solutions of the porous medium equation with growth with respect to the diffusion exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a macroscopic model for the growth of living tissues incorporating pressure-driven dispersal and pressure-modulated proliferation. Assuming a power-law relation between the mechanical pressure and the cell density, the model can be expressed as the porous medium equation with a growth term. We prove H\"older continuous dependence of the solutions of the model on the diffusion exponent. The main difficulty lies in the degeneracy of the porous medium equations at vacuum. To deal with this issue, we first regularise the equation by shifting the initial data away from zero and then optimise the stability estimate derived in the regular setting.</description>

      <title>Scaling up ridge regression for brain encoding in a massive individual fMRI dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain encoding with neuroimaging data is an established analysis aimed at predicting human brain activity directly from complex stimuli features such as movie frames. Typically, these features are the latent space representation from an artificial neural network, and the stimuli are image, audio, or text inputs. Ridge regression is a popular prediction model for brain encoding due to its good out-of-sample generalization performance. However, training a ridge regression model can be highly time-consuming when dealing with large-scale deep functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets that include many space-time samples of brain activity. This paper evaluates different parallelization techniques to reduce the training time of brain encoding with ridge regression on the CNeuroMod Friends dataset, one of the largest deep fMRI resource currently available. With multi-threading, our results show that the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) significantly outperforms the OpenBLAS library, being 1.9 times faster using 32 threads on a single machine. We then evaluated the Dask multi-CPU implementation of ridge regression readily available in scikit-learn (MultiOutput), and we proposed a new "batch" version of Dask parallelization, motivated by a time complexity analysis. In line with our theoretical analysis, MultiOutput parallelization was found to be impractical, i.e., slower than multi-threading on a single machine. In contrast, the Batch-MultiOutput regression scaled well across compute nodes and threads, providing speed-ups of up to 33 times with 8 compute nodes and 32 threads compared to a single-threaded scikit-learn execution. Batch parallelization using Dask thus emerges as a scalable approach for brain encoding with ridge regression on high-performance computing systems using scikit-learn and large fMRI datasets.</description>

      <title>FluxGAT: Integrating Flux Sampling with Graph Neural Networks for Unbiased Gene Essentiality Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene essentiality, the necessity of a specific gene for the survival of an organism, is crucial to our understanding of cellular processes and identifying drug targets. Experimental determination of gene essentiality requires large growth screens that are time-consuming and expensive, motivating the development of in-silico approaches. Existing methods predominantly utilise flux balance analysis (FBA), a constraint-based optimisation algorithm; however, they are fundamentally limited by the necessity of a predefined cellular objective function. This requirement introduces an element of observer bias, as the objective function often reflects the researcher's assumptions rather than the cell's biological goals. Here, we present FluxGAT, a graph neural network (GNN) model capable of predicting gene essentiality directly from graphical representations of flux sampling data. Flux sampling removes the need for objective functions, thereby eliminating observer bias. FluxGAT leverages the unique strengths of GNNs in learning representations of complex relationships within metabolic reaction networks. The success of our approach in predicting experimentally determined gene essentiality, with almost double the sensitivity of FBA, explores the possibility of predicting cellular phenotypes in cases when objectives are less understood. Thus, we demonstrate a method for more general gene essentiality predictions across a broader spectrum of biological systems and environments.</description>

      <title>So You Want to Image Myelin Using MRI: Magnetic Susceptibility Source Separation for Myelin Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In MRI, researchers have long endeavored to effectively visualize myelin distribution in the brain, a pursuit with significant implications for both scientific research and clinical applications. Over time, various methods such as myelin water imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometric imaging have been developed, each carrying distinct advantages and limitations. Recently, an innovative technique named as magnetic susceptibility source separation has emerged, introducing a novel surrogate biomarker for myelin in the form of a diamagnetic susceptibility map. This paper comprehensively reviews this cutting-edge method, providing the fundamental concepts of magnetic susceptibility, susceptibility imaging, and the validation of the diamagnetic susceptibility map as a myelin biomarker that indirectly measure myelin content. Additionally, the paper explores essential aspects of data acquisition and processing, offering practical insights for readers. A comparison with established myelin imaging methods is also presented, and both current and prospective clinical and scientific applications are discussed to provide a holistic understanding of the technique. This work aims to serve as a foundational resource for newcomers entering this dynamic and rapidly expanding field.</description>
