      <title>Fair Diversity Maximization with Few Representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diversity maximization problem is a well-studied problem where the goal is to find $k$ diverse items. Fair diversity maximization aims to select a diverse subset of $k$ items from a large dataset, while requiring that each group of items be well represented in the output. More formally, given a set of items with labels, our goal is to find $k$ items that maximize the minimum pairwise distance in the set, while maintaining that each label is represented within some budget. In many cases, one is only interested in selecting a handful (say a constant) number of items from each group. In such scenario we show that a randomized algorithm based on padded decompositions improves the state-of-the-art approximation ratio to $\sqrt{\log(m)}/(3m)$, where $m$ is the number of labels. The algorithms work in several stages: ($i$) a preprocessing pruning which ensures that points with the same label are far away from each other, ($ii$) a decomposition phase, where points are randomly placed in clusters such that there is a feasible solution with maximum one point per cluster and that any feasible solution will be diverse, $(iii)$ assignment phase, where clusters are assigned to labels, and a representative point with the corresponding label is selected from each cluster. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of our algorithm on large datasets.</description>

      <title>Testing Suffixient Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suffixient sets are a novel prefix array (PA) compression technique based on subsampling PA (rather than compressing the entire array like previous techniques used to do): by storing very few entries of PA (in fact, a compressed number of entries), one can prove that pattern matching via binary search is still possible provided that random access is available on the text. In this paper, we tackle the problems of determining whether a given subset of text positions is (1) a suffixient set or (2) a suffixient set of minimum cardinality. We provide linear-time algorithms solving these problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize a new paradigm for optimality of algorithms, that generalizes worst-case optimality based only on input-size to problem-dependent parameters including implicit ones. We re-visit some existing sorting algorithms from this perspective, and also present a novel measure of sortedness that leads to an optimal algorithm based on partition sort. This paradigm of measuring efficiency of algorithms looks promising for further interesting applications beyond the existing ones.</description>

      <title>Optimal Graph Reconstruction by Counting Connected Components in Induced Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph reconstruction problem has been extensively studied under various query models. In this paper, we propose a new query model regarding the number of connected components, which is one of the most basic and fundamental graph parameters. Formally, we consider the problem of reconstructing an $n$-node $m$-edge graph with oracle queries of the following form: provided with a subset of vertices, the oracle returns the number of connected components in the induced subgraph. We show $\Theta(\frac{m \log n}{\log m})$ queries in expectation are both sufficient and necessary to adaptively reconstruct the graph. In contrast, we show that $\Omega(n^2)$ non-adaptive queries are required, even when $m = O(n)$. We also provide an $O(m\log n + n\log^2 n)$ query algorithm using only two rounds of adaptivity.</description>

      <title>Improving Online Bin Covering with Little Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The online bin covering problem is: given an input sequence of items find a placement of the items in the maximum number of bins such that the sum of the items' sizes in each bin is at least~1. Boyar~{\em et~al}.\@~\cite{boyar2021} present a strategy that with $O(\log \log n)$ bits of advice, where $n$ is the length of the input sequence, achieves a competitive ratio of $8/15\approx0.5333\ldots$. We show that with a strengthened analysis and some minor improvements, the same strategy achieves the significantly improved competitive ratio of~$135/242\approx0.5578\ldots$, still using $O(\log \log n)$ bits of advice.</description>

      <title>Private Evolution Converges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a new theoretical framework to explain PE's practical behavior and identify sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive datasets with $n$ data points from a bounded domain, we prove that PE produces an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein distance of order $\tilde{O}(d(n\epsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original, establishing worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our theoretical findings in simulations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Learned Indexes in LSM-tree Systems: Benchmarks,Insights and Design Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LSM-tree-based data stores are widely used in industry due to their exceptional performance. However, as data volumes grow, efficiently querying large-scale databases becomes increasingly challenging. To address this, recent studies attempted to integrate learned indexes into LSM-trees to enhance lookup performance, which has demonstrated promising improvements. Despite this, only a limited range of learned index types has been considered, and the strengths and weaknesses of different learned indexes remain unclear, making them difficult for practical use. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive and systematic benchmark to pursue an in-depth understanding of learned indexes in LSM-tree systems. In this work, we summarize the workflow of 8 existing learned indexes and analyze the associated theoretical cost. We also identify several key factors that significantly influence the performance of learned indexes and conclude them with a novel configuration space, including various index types, boundary positions, and granularity. Moreover, we implement different learned index designs on a unified platform to evaluate across various configurations. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal several unexpected insights, such as the marginal lookup enhancement when allocating a large memory budget to learned indexes and modest retraining overhead of learned indexes. Besides, we also offer practical guidelines to help developers intelligently select and tune learned indexes for custom use cases.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair Representation: Clustering and Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consensus clustering, a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, aims to aggregate multiple input clusterings of a dataset, potentially based on different non-sensitive attributes, into a single clustering that best represents the collective structure of the data. In this work, we study this fundamental problem through the lens of fair clustering, as introduced by Chierichetti et al. [NeurIPS'17], which incorporates the disparate impact doctrine to ensure proportional representation of each protected group in the dataset within every cluster. Our objective is to find a consensus clustering that is not only representative but also fair with respect to specific protected attributes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address this problem and provide a constant-factor approximation.
  As part of our investigation, we examine how to minimally modify an existing clustering to enforce fairness -- an essential postprocessing step in many clustering applications that require fair representation. We develop an optimal algorithm for datasets with equal group representation and near-linear time constant factor approximation algorithms for more general scenarios with different proportions of two group sizes. We complement our approximation result by showing that the problem is NP-hard for two unequal-sized groups. Given the fundamental nature of this problem, we believe our results on Closest Fair Clustering could have broader implications for other clustering problems, particularly those for which no prior approximation guarantees exist for their fair variants.</description>

      <title>Excluding an induced wheel minor in graphs without large induced stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a conjecture due to Dallard, Krnc, Kwon, Milani\v{c}, Munaro, \v{S}torgel, and Wiederrecht stating that for any positive integer $d$ and any planar graph $H$, the class of all $K_{1,d}$-free graphs without $H$ as an induced minor has bounded tree-independence number. A $k$-wheel is the graph obtained from a cycle of length $k$ by adding a vertex adjacent to all vertices of the cycle. We show that the conjecture of Dallard et al. is true when $H$ is a $k$-wheel for any $k\geq 3$. Our proof uses a generalization of the concept of brambles to tree-independence number. As a consequence of our main result, several important $\mathsf{NP}$-hard problems such as Maximum Independent Set are tractable on $K_{1,d}$-free graphs without large induced wheel minors. Moreover, for fixed $d$ and $k$, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a $K_{1,d}$-free graph $G$ as input, finds an induced minor model of a $k$-wheel in $G$ if one exists.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sparse SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the ground state of strongly-interacting fermionic systems is often the prerequisite for fully understanding both quantum chemistry and condensed matter systems. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a representative example of such a system; it is particularly interesting not only due to the existence of efficient quantum algorithms preparing approximations to the ground state such as Hastings--O'Donnell (STOC 2022), but also known no-go results for many classical ansatzes in preparing low-energy states. However, this quantum-classical separation is known to \emph{not} persist when the SYK model is sufficiently sparsified, i.e., when terms in the model are discarded with probability $1-p$, where $p=\Theta(1/n^3)$ and $n$ is the system size. This raises the question of how robust the quantum and classical complexities of the SYK model are to sparsification.
  In this work we initiate the study of the sparse SYK model where $p \in [\Theta(1/n^3),1]$. We show there indeed exists a certain robustness of sparsification. First, we prove that the quantum algorithm of Hastings--O'Donnell for $p=1$ still achieves a constant-factor approximation to the ground energy when $p\geq\Omega(\log n/n)$. Additionally, we prove that with high probability, Gaussian states cannot achieve better than a $O(\sqrt{\log n/pn})$-factor approximation to the true ground state energy of sparse SYK. This is done through a general classical circuit complexity lower-bound of $\Omega(pn^3)$ for any quantum state achieving a constant-factor approximation. Combined, these show a provable separation between classical algorithms outputting Gaussian states and efficient quantum algorithms for the goal of finding approximate sparse SYK ground states when $p \geq \Omega(\log n/n)$, extending the analogous $p=1$ result of Hastings--O'Donnell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving optimization problems leads to elegant and practical solutions in a wide variety of real-world applications. In many of those real-world applications, some of the information required to specify the relevant optimization problem is noisy, uncertain, and expensive to obtain. In this work, we study how much of that information needs to be queried in order to obtain an approximately optimal solution to the relevant problem. In particular, we focus on the shortest path problem in graphs with dynamic edge costs. We adopt the $\textit{first passage percolation}$ model from probability theory wherein a graph $G'$ is derived from a weighted base graph $G$ by multiplying each edge weight by an independently chosen random number in $[1, \rho]$. Mathematicians have studied this model extensively when $G$ is a $d$-dimensional grid graph, but the behavior of shortest paths in this model is still poorly understood in general graphs. We make progress in this direction for a class of graphs that resemble real-world road networks. Specifically, we prove that if $G$ has a constant continuous doubling dimension, then for a given $s-t$ pair, we only need to probe the weights on $((\rho \log n )/ \epsilon)^{O(1)}$ edges in $G'$ in order to obtain a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation to the $s-t$ distance in $G'$. We also generalize the result to a correlated setting and demonstrate experimentally that probing improves accuracy in estimating $s-t$ distances.</description>

      <title>Dynamic online matching with budget refills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by sequential budgeted allocation problems, we study the online matching problem with budget refills. In this context, we consider an online bipartite graph G=(U,V,E), where the nodes in $V$ are discovered sequentially and nodes in $U$ are known beforehand. Each $u\in U$ is endowed with a budget $b_{u,t}\in \mathbb{N}$ that dynamically evolves over time. Unlike the canonical setting, in many applications, the budget can be refilled from time to time, which leads to a much richer dynamic that we consider here. Intuitively, adding extra budgets in $U$ seems to ease the matching task, and our results support this intuition. In fact, for the stochastic framework considered where we studied the matching size built by Greedy algorithm on an Erd\H{o}s-R{\'e}yni random graph, we showed that the matching size generated by Greedy converges with high probability to a solution of an explicit system of ODE. Moreover, under specific conditions, the competitive ratio (performance measure of the algorithm) can even tend to 1. For the adversarial part, where the graph considered is deterministic and the algorithm used is Balance, the $b$-matching bound holds when the refills are scarce. However, when refills are regular, our results suggest a potential improvement in algorithm performance. In both cases, Balance algorithm manages to reach the performance of the upper bound on the adversarial graphs considered.</description>

      <title>Positional Attention: Expressivity and Learnability of Algorithmic Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in the ability of neural networks to execute algorithmic tasks (e.g., arithmetic, summary statistics, and sorting). The goal of this work is to better understand the role of attention in Transformers for algorithmic execution. Its importance for algorithmic execution has been studied theoretically and empirically using parallel computational models. Notably, many parallel algorithms communicate between processors solely using positional information. Inspired by this observation, we investigate how Transformers can execute algorithms using positional attention, where attention weights depend exclusively on positional encodings. We prove that Transformers with positional attention (positional Transformers) maintain the same expressivity of parallel computational models, incurring a logarithmic depth cost relative to the input length. We analyze their in-distribution learnability and explore how parameter norms in positional attention affect sample complexity. Our results show that positional Transformers introduce a learning trade-off: while they exhibit better theoretical dependence on parameter norms, certain tasks may require more layers, which can, in turn, increase sample complexity. Finally, we empirically explore the out-of-distribution performance of positional Transformers and find that they perform well in tasks where their underlying algorithmic solution relies on positional information.</description>

      <title>A Framework for the Design of Efficient Diversification Algorithms to NP-Hard Problems</title>

Abstract: There has been considerable recent interest in computing a diverse collection of solutions to a given optimization problem, both in the AI and theory communities. Given a classical optimization problem $\Pi$ (e.g., spanning tree, minimum cuts, maximum matching, minimum vertex cover) with input size $n$ and an integer $k\geq 1$, the goal is to generate a collection of $k$ maximally diverse solutions to $\Pi$. This diverse-X paradigm not only allows the user to generate very different solutions, but also helps make systems more secure and robust by handling uncertainty, and achieve energy efficiency.
  For problems $\Pi$ in P (such as spanning tree and minimum cut), there are efficient $\text{poly}(n,k)$ approximation algorithms available for the diverse variants [Hanaka et al. AAAI 2021, 2022, 2023, Gao et al. LATIN 2022, de Berg et al. ISAAC 2023]. In contrast, only FPT algorithms are known for NP-hard problems such as vertex covers and independent sets [Baste et al. IJCAI 2020, Eiben et al. SODA 2024, Misra et al. ISAAC 2024, Austrin et al. ICALP 2025], but in the worst case, these algorithms run in time $\exp((kn)^c)$ for some $c&gt;0$. In this work, we address this gap and give $\text{poly}(n,k)$ or $f(k)\text{poly}(n)$ time approximation algorithms for diversification variants of several NP-hard problems such as knapsack, maximum weight independent sets (MWIS) and minimum vertex covers in planar graphs, geometric (rectangle) knapsack, enclosing points by polygon, and MWIS in unit-disk-graphs of points in convex position. Our results are achieved by developing a general framework and applying it to problems with textbook dynamic-programming algorithms to find one solution.</description>

      <title>Computing Diverse and Nice Triangulations</title>

Abstract: We initiate the study of computing diverse triangulations to a given polygon. Given a simple $n$-gon $P$, an integer $ k \geq 2 $, a quality measure $\sigma$ on the set of triangulations of $P$ and a factor $ \alpha \geq 1 $, we formulate the Diverse and Nice Triangulations (DNT) problem that asks to compute $k$ \emph{distinct} triangulations $T_1,\dots,T_k$ of $P$ such that a) their diversity, $\sum_{i &lt; j} d(T_i,T_j) $, is as large as possible \emph{and} b) they are nice, i.e., $\sigma(T_i) \leq \alpha \sigma^* $ for all $1\leq i \leq k$. Here, $d$ denotes the symmetric difference of edge sets of two triangulations, and $\sigma^*$ denotes the best quality of triangulations of $P$, e.g., the minimum Euclidean length.
  As our main result, we provide a $\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$-time approximation algorithm for the DNT problem that returns a collection of $k$ distinct triangulations whose diversity is at least $1 - \Theta(1/k)$ of the optimal, and each triangulation satisfies the quality constraint. This is accomplished by studying \emph{bi-criteria triangulations} (BCT), which are triangulations that simultaneously optimize two criteria, a topic of independent interest. We complement our approximation algorithms by showing that the DNT problem and the BCT problem are NP-hard.
  Finally, for the version where diversity is defined as $\min_{i &lt; j} d(T_i,T_j) $, we show a reduction from the problem of computing optimal Hamming codes, and provide an $n^{O(k)}$-time $\tfrac12$-approximation algorithm. This improves over the naive ${C_{n-2} \choose k} \approx 2^{O(nk)}$ time bound for enumerating all $k$-tuples among the triangulations of a simple $n$-gon, where $C_n$ denotes the $n$-th Catalan number.</description>

      <title>An $O(\log \log n)$-approximate budget feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, there is a set of items $U$, each owned by a distinct seller. The seller of item $e$ incurs a private cost $\overline{c}_e$ for supplying her item. A buyer wishes to procure a set of items from the sellers of maximum value, where the value of a set $S\subseteq U$ of items is given by a valuation function $v:2^U\to \mathbb{R}_+$. The buyer has a budget of $B \in \mathbb{R}_+$ for the total payments made to the sellers. We wish to design a mechanism that is truthful, that is, sellers are incentivized to report their true costs, budget-feasible, that is, the sum of the payments made to the sellers is at most the budget $B$, and that outputs a set whose value is large compared to $\text{OPT}:=\max\{v(S):\overline{c}(S)\le B,S\subseteq U\}$.
  Budget-feasible mechanism design has been extensively studied, with the literature focussing on (classes of) subadditive valuation functions, and various polytime, budget-feasible mechanisms, achieving constant-factor approximation, have been devised for the special cases of additive, submodular, and XOS valuations. However, for general subadditive valuations, the best-known approximation factor achievable by a polytime budget-feasible mechanism (given access to demand oracles) was only $O(\log n / \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of items.
  We improve this state-of-the-art significantly by designing a randomized budget-feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations that achieves a substantially-improved approximation factor of $O(\log\log n)$ and runs in polynomial time, given access to demand oracles.</description>
