      <title>Sharp detection of low-dimensional structure in probability measures via dimensional logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional probability measures is an essential pre-processing step for efficient sampling. We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $\pi$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $\mu$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincar\'e inequality offers improved bounds.</description>

      <title>von Mises Quasi-Processes for Bayesian Circular Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for regression models to predict circular values arises in many scientific fields. In this work we explore a family of expressive and interpretable distributions over circle-valued random functions related to Gaussian processes targeting two Euclidean dimensions conditioned on the unit circle. The resulting probability model has connections with continuous spin models in statistical physics. Moreover, its density is very simple and has maximum-entropy, unlike previous Gaussian process-based approaches, which use wrapping or radial marginalization. For posterior inference, we introduce a new Stratonovich-like augmentation that lends itself to fast Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We argue that transductive learning in these models favors a Bayesian approach to the parameters. We present experiments applying this model to the prediction of (i) wind directions and (ii) the percentage of the running gait cycle as a function of joint angles.</description>

      <title>Conditional score-based diffusion models for solving inverse problems in mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework to perform Bayesian inference using conditional score-based diffusion models to solve a class of inverse problems in mechanics involving the inference of a specimen's spatially varying material properties from noisy measurements of its mechanical response to loading. Conditional score-based diffusion models are generative models that learn to approximate the score function of a conditional distribution using samples from the joint distribution. More specifically, the score functions corresponding to multiple realizations of the measurement are approximated using a single neural network, the so-called score network, which is subsequently used to sample the posterior distribution using an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme based on Langevin dynamics. Training the score network only requires simulating the forward model. Hence, the proposed approach can accommodate black-box forward models and complex measurement noise. Moreover, once the score network has been trained, it can be re-used to solve the inverse problem for different realizations of the measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a suite of high-dimensional inverse problems in mechanics that involve inferring heterogeneous material properties from noisy measurements. Some examples we consider involve synthetic data, while others include data collected from actual elastography experiments. Further, our applications demonstrate that the proposed approach can handle different measurement modalities, complex patterns in the inferred quantities, non-Gaussian and non-additive noise models, and nonlinear black-box forward models. The results show that the proposed framework can solve large-scale physics-based inverse problems efficiently.</description>

      <title>Coupled Input-Output Dimension Reduction: Application to Goal-oriented Bayesian Experimental Design and Global Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a high-dimensional function. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most sensitive parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.</description>

      <title>Approximately Equivariant Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant deep learning architectures exploit symmetries in learning problems to improve the sample efficiency of neural-network-based models and their ability to generalise. However, when modelling real-world data, learning problems are often not exactly equivariant, but only approximately. For example, when estimating the global temperature field from weather station observations, local topographical features like mountains break translation equivariance. In these scenarios, it is desirable to construct architectures that can flexibly depart from exact equivariance in a data-driven way. In this paper, we develop a general approach to achieving this using existing equivariant architectures. Our approach is agnostic to both the choice of symmetry group and model architecture, making it widely applicable. We consider the use of approximately equivariant architectures in neural processes (NPs), a popular family of meta-learning models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world regression experiments, demonstrating that approximately equivariant NP models can outperform both their non-equivariant and strictly equivariant counterparts.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling by Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper approaches the unsupervised learning problem by minimizing the second-order Wasserstein loss (the $W_2$ loss). The minimization is characterized by a distribution-dependent ordinary differential equation (ODE), whose dynamics involves the Kantorovich potential between a current estimated distribution and the true data distribution. A main result shows that the time-marginal law of the ODE converges exponentially to the true data distribution. To prove that the ODE has a unique solution, we first construct explicitly a solution to the associated nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation and show that it coincides with the unique gradient flow for the $W_2$ loss. Based on this, a unique solution to the ODE is built from Trevisan's superposition principle and the exponential convergence results. An Euler scheme is proposed for the distribution-dependent ODE and it is shown to correctly recover the gradient flow for the $W_2$ loss in the limit. An algorithm is designed by following the scheme and applying persistent training, which is natural in our gradient-flow framework. In both low- and high-dimensional experiments, our algorithm converges much faster than and outperforms Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, by increasing the level of persistent training appropriately.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Adaptive Batch Size Strategies for Distributed Local Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep neural networks often require distributed training with many workers due to their large size. As worker numbers increase, communication overheads become the main bottleneck in data-parallel minibatch stochastic gradient methods with per-iteration gradient synchronization. Local gradient methods like Local SGD reduce communication by only syncing after several local steps. Despite understanding their convergence in i.i.d. and heterogeneous settings and knowing the importance of batch sizes for efficiency and generalization, optimal local batch sizes are difficult to determine. We introduce adaptive batch size strategies for local gradient methods that increase batch sizes adaptively to reduce minibatch gradient variance. We provide convergence guarantees under homogeneous data conditions and support our claims with image classification experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategies in training and generalization.</description>

      <title>Random pairing MLE for estimation of item parameters in Rasch model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rasch model, a classical model in the item response theory, is widely used in psychometrics to model the relationship between individuals' latent traits and their binary responses on assessments or questionnaires. In this paper, we introduce a new likelihood-based estimator -- random pairing maximum likelihood estimator ($\mathsf{RP\text{-}MLE}$) and its bootstrapped variant multiple random pairing MLE ($\mathsf{MRP\text{-}MLE}$) that faithfully estimate the item parameters in the Rasch model. The new estimators have several appealing features compared to existing ones. First, both work for sparse observations, an increasingly important scenario in the big data era. Second, both estimators are provably minimax optimal in terms of finite sample $\ell_{\infty}$ estimation error. Lastly, $\mathsf{RP\text{-}MLE}$ admits precise distributional characterization that allows uncertainty quantification on the item parameters, e.g., construction of confidence intervals of the item parameters. The main idea underlying $\mathsf{RP\text{-}MLE}$ and $\mathsf{MRP\text{-}MLE}$ is to randomly pair user-item responses to form item-item comparisons. This is carefully designed to reduce the problem size while retaining statistical independence. We also provide empirical evidence of the efficacy of the two new estimators using both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Unobserved Bifurcation by Unsupervised Extraction of Slowly Time-Varying System Parameter Dynamics from Time Series Using Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear and non-stationary processes are prevalent in various natural and physical phenomena, where system dynamics can change qualitatively due to bifurcation phenomena. Traditional machine learning methods have advanced our ability to learn and predict such systems from observed time series data. However, predicting the behavior of systems with temporal parameter variations without knowledge of true parameter values remains a significant challenge. This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.</description>

      <title>Deep Optimal Experimental Design for Parameter Estimation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal experimental design is a well studied field in applied science and engineering. Techniques for estimating such a design are commonly used within the framework of parameter estimation. Nonetheless, in recent years parameter estimation techniques are changing rapidly with the introduction of deep learning techniques to replace traditional estimation methods. This in turn requires the adaptation of optimal experimental design that is associated with these new techniques. In this paper we investigate a new experimental design methodology that uses deep learning. We show that the training of a network as a Likelihood Free Estimator can be used to significantly simplify the design process and circumvent the need for the computationally expensive bi-level optimization problem that is inherent in optimal experimental design for non-linear systems. Furthermore, deep design improves the quality of the recovery process for parameter estimation problems. As proof of concept we apply our methodology to two different systems of Ordinary Differential Equations.</description>

      <title>Confidence Intervals and Simultaneous Confidence Bands Based on Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have significantly improved prediction accuracy in various fields, gaining recognition across numerous disciplines. Yet, an aspect of deep learning that remains insufficiently addressed is the assessment of prediction uncertainty. Producing reliable uncertainty estimators could be crucial in practical terms. For instance, predictions associated with a high degree of uncertainty could be sent for further evaluation. Recent works in uncertainty quantification of deep learning predictions, including Bayesian posterior credible intervals and a frequentist confidence-interval estimation, have proven to yield either invalid or overly conservative intervals. Furthermore, there is currently no method for quantifying uncertainty that can accommodate deep neural networks for survival (time-to-event) data that involves right-censored outcomes. In this work, we provide a valid non-parametric bootstrap method that correctly disentangles data uncertainty from the noise inherent in the adopted optimization algorithm, ensuring that the resulting point-wise confidence intervals or the simultaneous confidence bands are accurate (i.e., valid and not overly conservative). The proposed ad-hoc method can be easily integrated into any deep neural network without interfering with the training process. The utility of the proposed approach is illustrated by constructing simultaneous confidence bands for survival curves derived from deep neural networks for survival data with right censoring.</description>

Abstract: Tree-based ensemble methods such as random forests, gradient-boosted trees, and Bayesianadditive regression trees have been successfully used for regression problems in many applicationsand research studies. In this paper, we study ensemble versions of probabilisticregression trees that provide smooth approximations of the objective function by assigningeach observation to each region with respect to a probability distribution. We prove thatthe ensemble versions of probabilistic regression trees considered are consistent, and experimentallystudy their bias-variance trade-off and compare them with the state-of-the-art interms of performance prediction.</description>

      <title>A Practical Diffusion Path for Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art methods in generative modeling when samples from a target probability distribution are available, and can be efficiently sampled, using score matching to estimate score vectors guiding a Langevin process. However, in the setting where samples from the target are not available, e.g. when this target's density is known up to a normalization constant, the score estimation task is challenging. Previous approaches rely on Monte Carlo estimators that are either computationally heavy to implement or sample-inefficient. In this work, we propose a computationally attractive alternative, relying on the so-called dilation path, that yields score vectors that are available in closed-form. This path interpolates between a Dirac and the target distribution using a convolution. We propose a simple implementation of Langevin dynamics guided by the dilation path, using adaptive step-sizes. We illustrate the results of our sampling method on a range of tasks, and shows it performs better than classical alternatives.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Bandit Algorithms with Approximate Inference in Stochastic Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian bandit algorithms with approximate Bayesian inference have been widely used in real-world applications. Nevertheless, their theoretical justification is less investigated in the literature, especially for contextual bandit problems. To fill this gap, we propose a general theoretical framework to analyze stochastic linear bandits in the presence of approximate inference and conduct regret analysis on two Bayesian bandit algorithms, Linear Thompson sampling (LinTS) and the extension of Bayesian Upper Confidence Bound, namely Linear Bayesian Upper Confidence Bound (LinBUCB). We demonstrate that both LinTS and LinBUCB can preserve their original rates of regret upper bound but with a sacrifice of larger constant terms when applied with approximate inference. These results hold for general Bayesian inference approaches, under the assumption that the inference error measured by two different $\alpha$-divergences is bounded. Additionally, by introducing a new definition of well-behaved distributions, we show that LinBUCB improves the regret rate of LinTS from $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$, matching the minimax optimal rate. To our knowledge, this work provides the first regret bounds in the setting of stochastic linear bandits with bounded approximate inference errors.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Exchangeable Mechanisms for Causal Structure and Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying latent representations or causal structures is important for good generalization and downstream task performance. However, both fields have been developed rather independently. We observe that several methods in both representation and causal structure learning rely on the same data-generating process (DGP), namely, exchangeable but not i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) data. We provide a unified framework, termed Identifiable Exchangeable Mechanisms (IEM), for representation and structure learning under the lens of exchangeability. IEM provides new insights that let us relax the necessary conditions for causal structure identification in exchangeable non--i.i.d. data. We also demonstrate the existence of a duality condition in identifiable representation learning, leading to new identifiability results. We hope this work will pave the way for further research in causal representation learning.</description>

      <title>Transferable Boltzmann Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Rating Multi-Modal Time-Series Forecasting Models (MM-TSFM) for Robustness Through a Causal Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems are notorious for their fragility; minor input changes can potentially cause major output swings. When such systems are deployed in critical areas like finance, the consequences of their uncertain behavior could be severe. In this paper, we focus on multi-modal time-series forecasting, where imprecision due to noisy or incorrect data can lead to erroneous predictions, impacting stakeholders such as analysts, investors, and traders. Recently, it has been shown that beyond numeric data, graphical transformations can be used with advanced visual models to achieve better performance. In this context, we introduce a rating methodology to assess the robustness of Multi-Modal Time-Series Forecasting Models (MM-TSFM) through causal analysis, which helps us understand and quantify the isolated impact of various attributes on the forecasting accuracy of MM-TSFM. We apply our novel rating method on a variety of numeric and multi-modal forecasting models in a large experimental setup (six input settings of control and perturbations, ten data distributions, time series from six leading stocks in three industries over a year of data, and five time-series forecasters) to draw insights on robust forecasting models and the context of their strengths. Within the scope of our study, our main result is that multi-modal (numeric + visual) forecasting, which was found to be more accurate than numeric forecasting in previous studies, can also be more robust in diverse settings. Our work will help different stakeholders of time-series forecasting understand the models` behaviors along trust (robustness) and accuracy dimensions to select an appropriate model for forecasting using our rating method, leading to improved decision-making.</description>

      <title>The Promise of Analog Deep Learning: Recent Advances, Challenges and Opportunities</title>

Abstract: Much of the present-day Artificial Intelligence (AI) utilizes artificial neural networks, which are sophisticated computational models designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems by learning from data. However, a major bottleneck occurs during a device's calculation of weighted sums for forward propagation and optimization procedure for backpropagation, especially for deep neural networks, or networks with numerous layers. Exploration into different methods of implementing neural networks is necessary for further advancement of the area. While a great deal of research into AI hardware in both directions, analog and digital implementation widely exists, much of the existing survey works lacks discussion on the progress of analog deep learning. To this end, we attempt to evaluate and specify the advantages and disadvantages, along with the current progress with regards to deep learning, for analog implementations. In this paper, our focus lies on the comprehensive examination of eight distinct analog deep learning methodologies across multiple key parameters. These parameters include attained accuracy levels, application domains, algorithmic advancements, computational speed, and considerations of energy efficiency and power consumption. We also identify the neural network-based experiments implemented using these hardware devices and discuss comparative performance achieved by the different analog deep learning methods along with an analysis of their current limitations. Overall, we find that Analog Deep Learning has great potential for future consumer-level applications, but there is still a long road ahead in terms of scalability. Most of the current implementations are more proof of concept and are not yet practically deployable for large-scale models.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box: predicting the trainability of deep neural networks with reconstruction entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important challenge in machine learning is to predict the initial conditions under which a given neural network will be trainable. We present a method for predicting the trainable regime in parameter space for deep feedforward neural networks, based on reconstructing the input from subsequent activation layers via a cascade of single-layer auxiliary networks. For both MNIST and CIFAR10, we show that a single epoch of training of the shallow cascade networks is sufficient to predict the trainability of the deep feedforward network, thereby providing a significant reduction in overall training time. We achieve this by computing the relative entropy between reconstructed images and the original inputs, and show that this probe of information loss is sensitive to the phase behaviour of the network. Our results provide a concrete link between the flow of information and the trainability of deep neural networks, further elucidating the role of criticality in these systems.</description>

      <title>Under the Hood of Tabular Data Generation Models: the Strong Impact of Hyperparameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dataset-specific hyperparameter, feature encoding, and architecture tuning on five recent model families for tabular data generation through an extensive benchmark on 16 datasets. This study addresses the practical need for a unified evaluation of models that fully considers hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, we propose a reduced search space for each model that allows for quick optimization, achieving nearly equivalent performance at a significantly lower cost.Our benchmark demonstrates that, for most models, large-scale dataset-specific tuning substantially improves performance compared to the original configurations. Furthermore, we confirm that diffusion-based models generally outperform other models on tabular data. However, this advantage is not significant when the entire tuning and training process is restricted to the same GPU budget for all models.</description>

      <title>Data Plagiarism Index: Characterizing the Privacy Risk of Data-Copying in Tabular Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promise of tabular generative models is to produce realistic synthetic data that can be shared and safely used without dangerous leakage of information from the training set. In evaluating these models, a variety of methods have been proposed to measure the tendency to copy data from the training dataset when generating a sample. However, these methods suffer from either not considering data-copying from a privacy threat perspective, not being motivated by recent results in the data-copying literature or being difficult to make compatible with the high dimensional, mixed type nature of tabular data. This paper proposes a new similarity metric and Membership Inference Attack called Data Plagiarism Index (DPI) for tabular data. We show that DPI evaluates a new intuitive definition of data-copying and characterizes the corresponding privacy risk. We show that the data-copying identified by DPI poses both privacy and fairness threats to common, high performing architectures; underscoring the necessity for more sophisticated generative modeling techniques to mitigate this issue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for directly generating full events at detector-level from parton-level information, leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques. To address the challenge of multiplicity variations between parton and reconstructed object spaces, we employ transformers, score-based models and normalizing flows. Our method tackles the inherent complexities of the stochastic transition between these two spaces and achieves remarkably accurate results. The combination of innovative techniques and the achieved accuracy demonstrates the potential of our approach in advancing the field and opens avenues for further exploration. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in high-energy physics and generative modelling, providing a promising direction for enhanced precision in fast detector simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of synthetic data generation is crucial, especially in the retail sector where data accuracy is paramount. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for assessing synthetic retail data, focusing on fidelity, utility, and privacy. Our approach differentiates between continuous and discrete data attributes, providing precise evaluation criteria. Fidelity is measured through stability and generalizability. Stability ensures synthetic data accurately replicates known data distributions, while generalizability confirms its robustness in novel scenarios. Utility is demonstrated through the synthetic data's effectiveness in critical retail tasks such as demand forecasting and dynamic pricing, proving its value in predictive analytics and strategic planning. Privacy is safeguarded using Differential Privacy, ensuring synthetic data maintains a perfect balance between resembling training and holdout datasets without compromising security. Our findings validate that this framework provides reliable and scalable evaluation for synthetic retail data. It ensures high fidelity, utility, and privacy, making it an essential tool for advancing retail data science. This framework meets the evolving needs of the retail industry with precision and confidence, paving the way for future advancements in synthetic data methodologies.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Causal Representation Learning: Unsupervised, Multi-View, and Multi-Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal models provide rich descriptions of complex systems as sets of mechanisms by which each variable is influenced by its direct causes. They support reasoning about manipulating parts of the system and thus hold promise for addressing some of the open challenges of artificial intelligence (AI), such as planning, transferring knowledge in changing environments, or robustness to distribution shifts. However, a key obstacle to more widespread use of causal models in AI is the requirement that the relevant variables be specified a priori, which is typically not the case for the high-dimensional, unstructured data processed by modern AI systems. At the same time, machine learning (ML) has proven quite successful at automatically extracting useful and compact representations of such complex data. Causal representation learning (CRL) aims to combine the core strengths of ML and causality by learning representations in the form of latent variables endowed with causal model semantics.
  In this thesis, we study and present new results for different CRL settings. A central theme is the question of identifiability: Given infinite data, when are representations satisfying the same learning objective guaranteed to be equivalent? This is an important prerequisite for CRL, as it formally characterises if and when a learning task is, at least in principle, feasible. Since learning causal models, even without a representation learning component, is notoriously difficult, we require additional assumptions on the model class or rich data beyond the classical i.i.d. setting. By partially characterising identifiability for different settings, this thesis investigates what is possible for CRL without direct supervision, and thus contributes to its theoretical foundations. Ideally, the developed insights can help inform data collection practices or inspire the design of new practical estimation methods.</description>

      <title>High-probability minimax lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimax risk is often considered as a gold standard against which we can compare specific statistical procedures. Nevertheless, as has been observed recently in robust and heavy-tailed estimation problems, the inherent reduction of the (random) loss to its expectation may entail a significant loss of information regarding its tail behaviour. In an attempt to avoid such a loss, we introduce the notion of a minimax quantile, and seek to articulate its dependence on the quantile level. To this end, we develop high-probability variants of the classical Le Cam and Fano methods, as well as a technique to convert local minimax risk lower bounds to lower bounds on minimax quantiles. To illustrate the power of our framework, we deploy our techniques on several examples, recovering recent results in robust mean estimation and stochastic convex optimisation, as well as obtaining several new results in covariance matrix estimation, sparse linear regression, nonparametric density estimation and isotonic regression. Our overall goal is to argue that minimax quantiles can provide a finer-grained understanding of the difficulty of statistical problems, and that, in wide generality, lower bounds on these quantities can be obtained via user-friendly tools.</description>

      <title>In-Context In-Context Learning with Transformer Neural Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are a powerful family of meta-learning models that seek to approximate the posterior predictive map of the ground-truth stochastic process from which each dataset in a meta-dataset is sampled. There are many cases in which practitioners, besides having access to the dataset of interest, may also have access to other datasets that share similarities with it. In this case, integrating these datasets into the NP can improve predictions. We equip NPs with this functionality and describe this paradigm as in-context in-context learning. Standard NP architectures, such as the convolutional conditional NP (ConvCNP) or the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs), are not capable of in-context in-context learning, as they are only able to condition on a single dataset. We address this shortcoming by developing the in-context in-context learning pseudo-token TNP (ICICL-TNP). The ICICL-TNP builds on the family of PT-TNPs, which utilise pseudo-token-based transformer architectures to sidestep the quadratic computational complexity associated with regular transformer architectures. Importantly, the ICICL-TNP is capable of conditioning on both sets of datapoints and sets of datasets, enabling it to perform in-context in-context learning. We demonstrate the importance of in-context in-context learning and the effectiveness of the ICICL-TNP in a number of experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for calibration via stronger sign preservation games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of probabilistic forecasts is calibrated if each prediction of the forecaster closely approximates the empirical distribution of outcomes on the subset of timesteps where that prediction was made. We study the fundamental problem of online calibrated forecasting of binary sequences, which was initially studied by Foster &amp; Vohra (1998). They derived an algorithm with $O(T^{2/3})$ calibration error after $T$ time steps, and showed a lower bound of $\Omega(T^{1/2})$. These bounds remained stagnant for two decades, until Qiao &amp; Valiant (2021) improved the lower bound to $\Omega(T^{0.528})$ by introducing a combinatorial game called sign preservation and showing that lower bounds for this game imply lower bounds for calibration.
  We introduce a strengthening of Qiao &amp; Valiant's game that we call sign preservation with reuse (SPR). We prove that the relationship between SPR and calibrated forecasting is bidirectional: not only do lower bounds for SPR translate into lower bounds for calibration, but algorithms for SPR also translate into new algorithms for calibrated forecasting. In particular, any strategy that improves the trivial upper bound for the value of the SPR game would imply a forecasting algorithm with calibration error exponent less than 2/3, improving Foster &amp; Vohra's upper bound for the first time. Using similar ideas, we then prove a slightly stronger lower bound than that of Qiao &amp; Valiant, namely $\Omega(T^{0.54389})$. Our lower bound is obtained by an oblivious adversary, marking the first $\omega(T^{1/2})$ calibration lower bound for oblivious adversaries.</description>

      <title>Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Distance on a System of Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance in Optimal Transport (OT) is widely used in various applications thanks to its statistical effectiveness and computational efficiency. On the other hand, Tree Wassenstein (TW) and Tree-sliced Wassenstein (TSW) are instances of OT for probability measures where its ground cost is a tree metric. TSW also has a low computational complexity, i.e. linear to the number of edges in the tree. Especially, TSW is identical to SW when the tree is a chain. While SW is prone to loss of topological information of input measures due to relying on one-dimensional projection, TSW is more flexible and has a higher degree of freedom by choosing a tree rather than a line to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in SW. However, for practical applications, popular tree metric sampling methods are heavily built upon given supports, which limits their capacity to adapt to new supports. In this paper, we propose the Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on a System of Lines (TSW-SL), which brings a connection between SW and TSW. Compared to SW and TSW, our TSW-SL benefits from the higher degree of freedom of TSW while being suitable to dynamic settings as SW. In TSW-SL, we use a variant of the Radon Transform to project measures onto a system of lines, resulting in measures on a space with a tree metric, then leverage TW to efficiently compute distances between them. We empirically verify the advantages of TSW-SL over the traditional SW by conducting a variety of experiments on gradient flows, image style transfer, and generative models.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Hidden Structure of Self-Attention via Kernel Principal Component Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers in sequence modeling tasks, spanning various applications in natural language processing and computer vision, is attributed to the critical role of self-attention. Similar to the development of most deep learning models, the construction of these attention mechanisms rely on heuristics and experience. In our work, we derive self-attention from kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) and show that self-attention projects its query vectors onto the principal component axes of its key matrix in a feature space. We then formulate the exact formula for the value matrix in self-attention, theoretically and empirically demonstrating that this value matrix captures the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix of the key vectors in self-attention. Leveraging our kernel PCA framework, we propose Attention with Robust Principal Components (RPC-Attention), a novel class of robust attention that is resilient to data contamination. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of RPC-Attention over softmax attention on the ImageNet-1K object classification, WikiText-103 language modeling, and ADE20K image segmentation task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairwise dot-product self-attention is key to the success of transformers that achieve state-of-the-art performance across a variety of applications in language and vision. This dot-product self-attention computes attention weights among the input tokens using Euclidean distance, which makes the model prone to representation collapse and vulnerable to contaminated samples. In this paper, we propose using a Mahalanobis distance metric for computing the attention weights to stretch the underlying feature space in directions of high contextual relevance. In particular, we define a hyper-ellipsoidal neighborhood around each query to increase the attention weights of the tokens lying in the contextually important directions. We term this novel class of attention Elliptical Attention. Our Elliptical Attention provides two benefits: 1) reducing representation collapse and 2) enhancing the model's robustness as the Elliptical Attention pays more attention to contextually relevant information rather than focusing on some small subset of informative features. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of Elliptical Attention over the baseline dot-product attention and state-of-the-art attention methods on various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling across different data modalities.</description>

Like neural network layers, these attention mechanisms are often developed by heuristics and experience. To provide a principled framework for constructing attention layers in transformers, we show that the self-attention corresponds to the support vector expansion derived from a support vector regression problem, whose primal formulation has the form of a neural network layer. Using our framework, we derive popular attention layers used in practice and propose two new attentions: 1) the Batch Normalized Attention (Attention-BN) derived from the batch normalization layer and 2) the Attention with Scaled Head (Attention-SH) derived from using less training data to fit the SVR model. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of the Attention-BN and Attention-SH in reducing head redundancy, increasing the model's accuracy, and improving the model's efficiency in a variety of practical applications including image and time-series classification.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Missing Data Analytical Techniques in Longitudinal Research: Traditional and Machine Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing Not at Random (MNAR) and nonnormal data are challenging to handle. Traditional missing data analytical techniques such as full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) may fail with nonnormal data as they are built on normal distribution assumptions. Two-Stage Robust Estimation (TSRE) does manage nonnormal data, but both FIML and TSRE are less explored in longitudinal studies under MNAR conditions with nonnormal distributions. Unlike traditional statistical approaches, machine learning approaches do not require distributional assumptions about the data. More importantly, they have shown promise for MNAR data; however, their application in longitudinal studies, addressing both Missing at Random (MAR) and MNAR scenarios, is also underexplored. This study utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to assess and compare the effectiveness of six analytical techniques for missing data within the growth curve modeling framework. These techniques include traditional approaches like FIML and TSRE, machine learning approaches by single imputation (K-Nearest Neighbors and missForest), and machine learning approaches by multiple imputation (micecart and miceForest). We investigate the influence of sample size, missing data rate, missing data mechanism, and data distribution on the accuracy and efficiency of model estimation. Our findings indicate that FIML is most effective for MNAR data among the tested approaches. TSRE excels in handling MAR data, while missForest is only advantageous in limited conditions with a combination of very skewed distributions, very large sample sizes (e.g., n larger than 1000), and low missing data rates.</description>

      <title>Cluster Quilting: Spectral Clustering for Patchwork Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patchwork learning arises as a new and challenging data collection paradigm where both samples and features are observed in fragmented subsets. Due to technological limits, measurement expense, or multimodal data integration, such patchwork data structures are frequently seen in neuroscience, healthcare, and genomics, among others. Instead of analyzing each data patch separately, it is highly desirable to extract comprehensive knowledge from the whole data set. In this work, we focus on the clustering problem in patchwork learning, aiming at discovering clusters amongst all samples even when some are never jointly observed for any feature. We propose a novel spectral clustering method called Cluster Quilting, consisting of (i) patch ordering that exploits the overlapping structure amongst all patches, (ii) patchwise SVD, (iii) sequential linear mapping of top singular vectors for patch overlaps, followed by (iv) k-means on the combined and weighted singular vectors. Under a sub-Gaussian mixture model, we establish theoretical guarantees via a non-asymptotic misclustering rate bound that reflects both properties of the patch-wise observation regime as well as the clustering signal and noise dependencies. We also validate our Cluster Quilting algorithm through extensive empirical studies on both simulated and real data sets in neuroscience and genomics, where it discovers more accurate and scientifically more plausible clusters than other approaches.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Regression Analysis with Model Misspecification and High-dimensional Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accessibility of vast volumes of unlabeled data has sparked growing interest in semi-supervised learning (SSL) and covariate shift transfer learning (CSTL). In this paper, we present an inference framework for estimating regression coefficients in conditional mean models within both SSL and CSTL settings, while allowing for the misspecification of conditional mean models. We develop an augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) method, employing regularized calibrated estimators for both propensity score (PS) and outcome regression (OR) nuisance models, with PS and OR models being sequentially dependent. We show that when the PS model is correctly specified, the proposed estimator achieves consistency, asymptotic normality, and valid confidence intervals, even with possible OR model misspecification and high-dimensional data. Moreover, by suppressing detailed technical choices, we demonstrate that previous methods can be unified within our AIPW framework. Our theoretical findings are verified through extensive simulation studies and a real-world data application.</description>

      <title>Generalization error of min-norm interpolators in transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the generalization error of pooled min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation in transfer learning where data from diverse distributions are available. Min-norm interpolators emerge naturally as implicit regularized limits of modern machine learning algorithms. Previous work characterized their out-of-distribution risk when samples from the test distribution are unavailable during training. However, in many applications, a limited amount of test data may be available during training, yet properties of min-norm interpolation in this setting are not well-understood. We address this gap by characterizing the bias and variance of pooled min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation under covariate and model shifts. The pooled interpolator captures both early fusion and a form of intermediate fusion. Our results have several implications: under model shift, for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), adding data always hurts. For higher SNR, transfer learning helps as long as the shift-to-signal (SSR) ratio lies below a threshold that we characterize explicitly. By consistently estimating these ratios, we provide a data-driven method to determine: (i) when the pooled interpolator outperforms the target-based interpolator, and (ii) the optimal number of target samples that minimizes the generalization error. Under covariate shift, if the source sample size is small relative to the dimension, heterogeneity between between domains improves the risk, and vice versa. We establish a novel anisotropic local law to achieve these characterizations, which may be of independent interest in random matrix theory. We supplement our theoretical characterizations with comprehensive simulations that demonstrate the finite-sample efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Forgetting in Language Model Fine-Tuning with Statistical Analysis of Example Associations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are known to suffer from forgetting of previously learned examples when fine-tuned, breaking stability of deployed LM systems. Despite efforts on mitigating forgetting, few have investigated whether, and how forgotten upstream examples are associated with newly learned tasks. Insights on such associations enable efficient and targeted mitigation of forgetting. In this paper, we empirically analyze forgetting that occurs in $N$ upstream examples while the model learns $M$ new tasks and visualize their associations with a $M \times N$ matrix. We empirically demonstrate that the degree of forgetting can often be approximated by simple multiplicative contributions of the upstream examples and newly learned tasks. We also reveal more complicated patterns where specific subsets of examples are forgotten with statistics and visualization. Following our analysis, we predict forgetting that happens on upstream examples when learning a new task with matrix completion over the empirical associations, outperforming prior approaches that rely on trainable LMs. Project website: https://inklab.usc.edu/lm-forgetting-prediction/</description>

      <title>Tracking solutions of time-varying variational inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking the solution of time-varying variational inequalities is an important problem with applications in game theory, optimization, and machine learning. Existing work considers time-varying games or time-varying optimization problems. For strongly convex optimization problems or strongly monotone games, these results provide tracking guarantees under the assumption that the variation of the time-varying problem is restrained, that is, problems with a sublinear solution path.  In this work we extend existing results in two ways:  In our first result, we provide tracking bounds for (1) variational inequalities with a sublinear solution path but not necessarily monotone functions, and (2) for periodic time-varying variational inequalities that do not necessarily have a sublinear solution path-length. Our second main contribution is an extensive study of the convergence behavior and trajectory of discrete dynamical systems of periodic time-varying VI. We show that these systems can exhibit provably chaotic behavior or can converge to the solution. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results with experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing multivariate post-processed visibility predictions utilizing CAMS forecasts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our contemporary era, meteorological weather forecasts increasingly incorporate ensemble predictions of visibility - a parameter of great importance in aviation, maritime navigation, and air quality assessment, with direct implications for public health. However, this weather variable falls short of the predictive accuracy achieved for other quantities issued by meteorological centers. Therefore, statistical post-processing is recommended to enhance the reliability and accuracy of predictions. By estimating the predictive distributions of the variables with the aid of historical observations and forecasts, one can achieve statistical consistency between true observations and ensemble predictions. Visibility observations, following the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization, are typically reported in discrete values; hence, the predictive distribution of the weather quantity takes the form of a discrete parametric law. Recent studies demonstrated that the application of classification algorithms can successfully improve the skill of such discrete forecasts; however, a frequently emerging issue is that certain spatial and/or temporal dependencies could be lost between marginals. Based on visibility ensemble forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for 30 locations in Central Europe, we investigate whether the inclusion of Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) predictions of the same weather quantity as an additional covariate could enhance the skill of the post-processing methods and whether it contributes to the successful integration of spatial dependence between marginals. Our study confirms that post-processed forecasts are substantially superior to raw and climatological predictions, and the utilization of CAMS forecasts provides a further significant enhancement both in the univariate and multivariate setup.</description>

Abstract: Universal differential equations (UDEs) leverage the respective advantages of mechanistic models and artificial neural networks and combine them into one dynamic model. However, these hybrid models can suffer from unrealistic solutions, such as negative values for biochemical quantities. We present non-negative UDE (nUDEs), a constrained UDE variant that guarantees non-negative values. Furthermore, we explore regularisation techniques to improve generalisation and interpretability of UDEs.</description>

      <title>Concentration of a sparse Bayesian model with Horseshoe prior in estimating high-dimensional precision matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision matrices are crucial in many fields such as social networks, neuroscience, and economics, representing the edge structure of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs), where a zero in an off-diagonal position of the precision matrix indicates conditional independence between nodes. In high-dimensional settings where the dimension of the precision matrix $p$ exceeds the sample size $n$ and the matrix is sparse, methods like graphical Lasso, graphical SCAD, and CLIME are popular for estimating GGMs. While frequentist methods are well-studied, Bayesian approaches for (unstructured) sparse precision matrices are less explored. The graphical horseshoe estimate by \citet{li2019graphical}, applying the global-local horseshoe prior, shows superior empirical performance, but theoretical work for sparse precision matrix estimations using shrinkage priors is limited. This paper addresses these gaps by providing concentration results for the tempered posterior with the fully specified horseshoe prior in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, we also provide novel theoretical results for model misspecification, offering a general oracle inequality for the posterior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of algorithms, termed Proximal Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithms (PIPLA), for inference and learning in latent variable models whose joint probability density is non-differentiable. Leveraging proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and the recently introduced interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), we propose several variants within the novel proximal IPLA family, tailored to the problem of estimating parameters in a non-differentiable statistical model. We prove nonasymptotic bounds for the parameter estimates produced by multiple algorithms in the strongly log-concave setting and provide comprehensive numerical experiments on various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed family of algorithms on a toy hierarchical example where our assumptions can be checked, as well as on the problems of sparse Bayesian logistic regression, sparse Bayesian neural network, and sparse matrix completion. Our theory and experiments together show that PIPLA family can be the de facto choice for parameter estimation problems in latent variable models for non-differentiable models.</description>

Abstract: Methods of computational quantum chemistry provide accurate approximations of molecular properties crucial for computer-aided drug discovery and other areas of chemical science. However, high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications. Neural network potentials (NNPs) are a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training. This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\nabla^2$DFT that is based on the nablaDFT. It contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. All calculations were performed at the DFT level ($\omega$B97X-D/def2-SVP) for each conformation. Moreover, $\nabla^2$DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks. Finally, we propose an extendable framework for training NNPs and implement 10 models within it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is crucial for various sectors, including aviation, agriculture, energy, and disaster preparedness. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of weather predictions by optimizing models based on public meteorological data. However, existing public datasets for GSWF optimization and benchmarking still suffer from significant limitations, such as small sizes, limited temporal coverage, and a lack of comprehensive variables. These shortcomings prevent them from effectively reflecting the benchmarks of current forecasting methods and fail to support the real needs of operational weather forecasting. To address these challenges, we present the WEATHER-5K dataset. This dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of data from 5,672 weather stations worldwide, spanning a 10-year period with one-hour intervals. It includes multiple crucial weather elements, providing a more reliable and interpretable resource for forecasting. Furthermore, our WEATHER-5K dataset can serve as a benchmark for comprehensively evaluating existing well-known forecasting models, extending beyond GSWF methods to support future time-series research challenges and opportunities. The dataset and benchmark implementation are publicly available at: https://github.com/taohan10200/WEATHER-5K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for point forecasting in univariate random walks often fail to surpass naive benchmarks due to data unpredictability. This study introduces a novel forecasting method that fuses movement prediction (binary classification) with naive forecasts for accurate one-step-ahead point forecasting. The method's efficacy is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, simulations, and real-world data experiments. It reliably exceeds naive forecasts with movement prediction accuracies as low as 0.55, outperforming baseline models like ARIMA, linear regression, MLP, and LSTM networks in forecasting the S\&amp;P 500 index and Bitcoin prices. This method is particularly advantageous when accurate point predictions are challenging but accurate movement predictions are attainable, translating movement predictions into point forecasts in random walk contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data for which a set of objects is described by multiple distinct feature sets (called views) is known as multi-view data. When missing values occur in multi-view data, all features in a view are likely to be missing simultaneously. This may lead to very large quantities of missing data which, especially when combined with high-dimensionality, can make the application of conditional imputation methods computationally infeasible. However, the multi-view structure could be leveraged to reduce the complexity and computational load of imputation. We introduce a new imputation method based on the existing stacked penalized logistic regression (StaPLR) algorithm for multi-view learning. It performs imputation in a dimension-reduced space to address computational challenges inherent to the multi-view context. We compare the performance of the new imputation method with several existing imputation algorithms in simulated data sets and a real data application. The results show that the new imputation method leads to competitive results at a much lower computational cost, and makes the use of advanced imputation algorithms such as missForest and predictive mean matching possible in settings where they would otherwise be computationally infeasible.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) constitute a flexible approach to both finding solutions and identifying parameters of partial differential equations. Most works on the topic assume noiseless data, or data contaminated with weak Gaussian noise. We show that the standard PINN framework breaks down in case of non-Gaussian noise. We give a way of resolving this fundamental issue and we propose to jointly train an energy-based model (EBM) to learn the correct noise distribution. We illustrate the improved performance of our approach using multiple examples.</description>

      <title>One Model Many Scores: Using Multiverse Analysis to Prevent Fairness Hacking and Evaluate the Influence of Model Design Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vast number of systems across the world use algorithmic decision making (ADM) to (partially) automate decisions that have previously been made by humans. The downstream effects of ADM systems critically depend on the decisions made during a systems' design, implementation, and evaluation, as biases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many of these decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they will influence the final system. To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and introduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness. In our proposed method, we turn implicit decisions during design and evaluation into explicit ones and demonstrate their fairness implications. By combining decisions, we create a grid of all possible "universes" of decision combinations. For each of these universes, we compute metrics of fairness and performance. Using the resulting dataset, one can investigate the variability and robustness of fairness scores and see how and which decisions impact fairness. We demonstrate how multiverse analyses can be used to better understand fairness implications of design and evaluation decisions using an exemplary case study of predicting public health care coverage for vulnerable populations. Our results highlight how decisions regarding the evaluation of a system can lead to vastly different fairness metrics for the same model. This is problematic, as a nefarious actor could optimise or "hack" a fairness metric to portray a discriminating model as fair merely by changing how it is evaluated. We illustrate how a multiverse analysis can help to address this issue.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a popular approach for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Its key idea is to use a surrogate model to approximate the objective and, importantly, quantify the associated uncertainty that allows a sequential search of query points that balance exploitation-exploration. Gaussian process (GP) has been a primary candidate for the surrogate model, thanks to its Bayesian-principled uncertainty quantification power and modeling flexibility. However, its challenges have also spurred an array of alternatives whose convergence properties could be more opaque. Motivated by these, we study in this paper an axiomatic framework that elicits the minimal requirements to guarantee black-box optimization convergence that could apply beyond GP-based methods. Moreover, we leverage the design freedom in our framework, which we call Pseudo-Bayesian Optimization, to construct empirically superior algorithms. In particular, we show how using simple local regression, and a suitable "randomized prior" construction to quantify uncertainty, not only guarantees convergence but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in examples ranging from high-dimensional synthetic experiments to realistic hyperparameter tuning and robotic applications.</description>

      <title>The statistical thermodynamics of generative diffusion models: Phase transitions, symmetry breaking and critical instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17467v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved spectacular performance in many areas of machine learning and generative modeling. While the fundamental ideas behind these models come from non-equilibrium physics, variational inference and stochastic calculus, in this paper we show that many aspects of these models can be understood using the tools of equilibrium statistical mechanics. Using this reformulation, we show that generative diffusion models undergo second-order phase transitions corresponding to symmetry breaking phenomena. We show that these phase-transitions are always in a mean-field universality class, as they are the result of a self-consistency condition in the generative dynamics. We argue that the critical instability that arises from the phase transitions lies at the heart of their generative capabilities, which are characterized by a set of mean-field critical exponents. Finally, we show that the dynamic equation of the generative process can be interpreted as a stochastic adiabatic transformation that minimizes the free energy while keeping the system in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Supervised low-rank semi-nonnegative matrix factorization with frequency regularization for forecasting spatio-temporal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel methodology for forecasting spatio-temporal data using supervised semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SSNMF) with frequency regularization. Matrix factorization is employed to decompose spatio-temporal data into spatial and temporal components. To improve clarity in the temporal patterns, we introduce a nonnegativity constraint on the time domain along with regularization in the frequency domain. Specifically, regularization in the frequency domain involves selecting features in the frequency space, making an interpretation in the frequency domain more convenient. We propose two methods in the frequency domain: soft and hard regularizations, and provide convergence guarantees to first-order stationary points of the corresponding constrained optimization problem. While our primary motivation stems from geophysical data analysis based on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data, our methodology has the potential for wider application. Consequently, when applying our methodology to GRACE data, we find that the results with the proposed methodology are comparable to previous research in the field of geophysical sciences but offer clearer interpretability.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Mitigating Biases in Motor Insurance Pricing</title>

Abstract: The non-life insurance sector operates within a highly competitive and tightly regulated framework, confronting a pivotal juncture in the formulation of pricing strategies. Insurers are compelled to harness a range of statistical methodologies and available data to construct optimal pricing structures that align with the overarching corporate strategy while accommodating the dynamics of market competition. Given the fundamental societal role played by insurance, premium rates are subject to rigorous scrutiny by regulatory authorities. These rates must conform to principles of transparency, explainability, and ethical considerations. Consequently, the act of pricing transcends mere statistical calculations and carries the weight of strategic and societal factors. These multifaceted concerns may drive insurers to establish equitable premiums, taking into account various variables. For instance, regulations mandate the provision of equitable premiums, considering factors such as policyholder gender or mutualist group dynamics in accordance with respective corporate strategies. Age-based premium fairness is also mandated. In certain insurance domains, variables such as the presence of serious illnesses or disabilities are emerging as new dimensions for evaluating fairness. Regardless of the motivating factor prompting an insurer to adopt fairer pricing strategies for a specific variable, the insurer must possess the capability to define, measure, and ultimately mitigate any ethical biases inherent in its pricing practices while upholding standards of consistency and performance. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive set of tools for these endeavors and assess their effectiveness through practical application in the context of automobile insurance.</description>

      <title>Feature learning as alignment: a structural property of gradient descent in non-linear neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms through which neural networks extract statistics from input-label pairs through feature learning is one of the most important unsolved problems in supervised learning. Prior works demonstrated that the gram matrices of the weights (the neural feature matrices, NFM) and the average gradient outer products (AGOP) become correlated during training, in a statement known as the neural feature ansatz (NFA). Through the NFA, the authors introduce mapping with the AGOP as a general mechanism for neural feature learning. However, these works do not provide a theoretical explanation for this correlation or its origins. In this work, we further clarify the nature of this correlation, and explain its emergence. We show that this correlation is equivalent to alignment between the left singular structure of the weight matrices and the newly defined pre-activation tangent features at each layer. We further establish that the alignment is driven by the interaction of weight changes induced by SGD with the pre-activation features, and analyze the resulting dynamics analytically at early times in terms of simple statistics of the inputs and labels. Finally, motivated by the observation that the NFA is driven by this centered correlation, we introduce a simple optimization rule that dramatically increases the NFA correlations at any given layer and improves the quality of features learned.</description>

      <title>Top-$K$ ranking with a monotone adversary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the top-$K$ ranking problem with a monotone adversary. We consider the scenario where a comparison graph is randomly generated and the adversary is allowed to add arbitrary edges. The statistician's goal is then to accurately identify the top-$K$ preferred items based on pairwise comparisons derived from this semi-random comparison graph. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a weighted maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) that achieves near-optimal sample complexity, up to a $\log^2(n)$ factor, where $n$ denotes the number of items under comparison. This is made possible through a combination of analytical and algorithmic innovations. On the analytical front, we provide a refined~$\ell_\infty$ error analysis of the weighted MLE that is more explicit and tighter than existing analyses. It relates the~$\ell_\infty$ error with the spectral properties of the weighted comparison graph. Motivated by this, our algorithmic innovation involves the development of an SDP-based approach to reweight the semi-random graph and meet specified spectral properties. Additionally, we propose a first-order method based on the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) framework. This method efficiently solves the resulting SDP in nearly-linear time relative to the size of the semi-random comparison graph.</description>

      <title>Certified Robust Accuracy of Neural Networks Are Bounded due to Bayes Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial examples pose a security threat to many critical systems built on neural networks. While certified training improves robustness, it also decreases accuracy noticeably. Despite various proposals for addressing this issue, the significant accuracy drop remains. More importantly, it is not clear whether there is a certain fundamental limit on achieving robustness whilst maintaining accuracy. In this work, we offer a novel perspective based on Bayes errors. By adopting Bayes error to robustness analysis, we investigate the limit of certified robust accuracy, taking into account data distribution uncertainties. We first show that the accuracy inevitably decreases in the pursuit of robustness due to changed Bayes error in the altered data distribution. Subsequently, we establish an upper bound for certified robust accuracy, considering the distribution of individual classes and their boundaries. Our theoretical results are empirically evaluated on real-world datasets and are shown to be consistent with the limited success of existing certified training results, e.g., for CIFAR10, our analysis results in an upper bound (of certified robust accuracy) of 67.49\%, meanwhile existing approaches are only able to increase it from 53.89\% in 2017 to 62.84\% in 2023.</description>

      <title>Contextual Continuum Bandits: Static Versus Dynamic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the contextual continuum bandits problem, where the learner sequentially receives a side information vector and has to choose an action in a convex set, minimizing a function associated to the context. The goal is to minimize all the underlying functions for the received contexts, leading to a dynamic (contextual) notion of regret, which is stronger than the standard static regret. Assuming that the objective functions are H\"older with respect to the contexts, we demonstrate that any algorithm achieving a sub-linear static regret can be extended to achieve a sub-linear dynamic regret. We further study the case of strongly convex and smooth functions when the observations are noisy. Inspired by the interior point method and employing self-concordant barriers, we propose an algorithm achieving a sub-linear dynamic regret. Lastly, we present a minimax lower bound, implying two key facts. First, no algorithm can achieve sub-linear dynamic regret over functions that are not continuous with respect to the context. Second, for strongly convex and smooth functions, the algorithm that we propose achieves, up to a logarithmic factor, the minimax optimal rate of dynamic regret as a function of the number of queries.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Structural Model Updating with Multimodal Variational Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel framework for Bayesian structural model updating is presented in this study. The proposed method utilizes the surrogate unimodal encoders of a multimodal variational autoencoder (VAE). The method facilitates an approximation of the likelihood when dealing with a small number of observations. It is particularly suitable for high-dimensional correlated simultaneous observations applicable to various dynamic analysis models. The proposed approach was benchmarked using a numerical model of a single-story frame building with acceleration and dynamic strain measurements. Additionally, an example involving a Bayesian update of nonlinear model parameters for a three-degree-of-freedom lumped mass model demonstrates computational efficiency when compared to using the original VAE, while maintaining adequate accuracy for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Neural Networks' parameters through Optimal Contraction in a Prediction Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to ensure the existence and uniqueness of optimal parameters in neural networks. The paper details how a recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be transformed into a contraction in a domain where its parameters are linear. It then demonstrates that a prediction problem modeled through an RNN, with a specific regularization term in the loss function, can have its first-order conditions expressed analytically. This system of equations is reduced to two matrix equations involving Sylvester equations, which can be partially solved. We establish that, if certain conditions are met, optimal parameters exist, are unique, and can be found through a straightforward algorithm to any desired precision. Also, as the number of neurons grows the conditions of convergence become easier to fulfill. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are also explored by including linear constraints on parameters. According to our model, incorporating loops (with fixed or variable weights) will produce loss functions that train easier, because it assures the existence of a region where an iterative method converges.</description>

Abstract: We examine the continuous-time counterpart of mirror descent, namely mirror flow, on classification problems which are linearly separable. Such problems are minimised `at infinity' and have many possible solutions; we study which solution is preferred by the algorithm depending on the mirror potential. For exponential tailed losses and under mild assumptions on the potential, we show that the iterates converge in direction towards a $\phi_\infty$-maximum margin classifier. The function $\phi_\infty$ is the $\textit{horizon function}$ of the mirror potential and characterises its shape `at infinity'. When the potential is separable, a simple formula allows to compute this function. We analyse several examples of potentials and provide numerical experiments highlighting our results.</description>

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods are workhorses in deep learning. However, the convergence guarantees of adaptive gradient methods for nonconvex optimization have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained convergence analysis for a general class of adaptive gradient methods including AMSGrad, RMSProp and AdaGrad. For smooth nonconvex functions, we prove that adaptive gradient methods in expectation converge to a first-order stationary point. Our convergence rate is better than existing results for adaptive gradient methods in terms of dimension. In addition, we also prove high probability bounds on the convergence rates of AMSGrad, RMSProp as well as AdaGrad, which have not been established before. Our analyses shed light on better understanding the mechanism behind adaptive gradient methods in optimizing nonconvex objectives.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks using a Soft Attention Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.04544v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged recently as a promising application of deep neural networks to the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been recognized that adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately the stubborn spots in the solution of "stiff" PDEs. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the weights. In addition, we show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs.</description>

      <title>Beyond IID: data-driven decision-making in heterogeneous environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09642v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How should one leverage historical data when past observations are not perfectly indicative of the future, e.g., due to the presence of unobserved confounders which one cannot "correct" for? Motivated by this question, we study a data-driven decision-making framework in which historical samples are generated from unknown and different distributions assumed to lie in a heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will be evaluated. This work aims at analyzing the performance of central data-driven policies but also near-optimal ones in these heterogeneous environments and understanding key drivers of performance. We establish a first result which allows to upper bound the asymptotic worst-case regret of a broad class of policies. Leveraging this result, for any integral probability metric, we provide a general analysis of the performance achieved by Sample Average Approximation (SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. This analysis is centered around the approximation parameter, a notion of complexity we introduce to capture how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the problem structure impacts the performance of SAA. In turn, we illustrate through several widely-studied problems -- e.g., newsvendor, pricing -- how this methodology can be applied and find that the performance of SAA varies considerably depending on the combinations of problem classes and heterogeneity. The failure of SAA for certain instances motivates the design of alternative policies to achieve rate-optimality. We derive problem-dependent policies achieving strong guarantees for the illustrative problems described above and provide initial results towards a principled approach for the design and analysis of general rate-optimal algorithms.</description>

      <title>Robust $Q$-learning Algorithm for Markov Decision Processes under Wasserstein Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel $Q$-learning algorithm tailored to solve distributionally robust Markov decision problems where the corresponding ambiguity set of transition probabilities for the underlying Markov decision process is a Wasserstein ball around a (possibly estimated) reference measure. We prove convergence of the presented algorithm and provide several examples also using real data to illustrate both the tractability of our algorithm as well as the benefits of considering distributional robustness when solving stochastic optimal control problems, in particular when the estimated distributions turn out to be misspecified in practice.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of Optimal Transport via Entropy-Regularized Extragradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient computation of the optimal transport distance between two distributions serves as an algorithm subroutine that empowers various applications. This paper develops a scalable first-order optimization-based method that computes optimal transport to within $\varepsilon$ additive accuracy with runtime $\widetilde{O}( n^2/\varepsilon)$, where $n$ denotes the dimension of the probability distributions of interest. Our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art computational guarantees among all first-order methods, while exhibiting favorable numerical performance compared to classical algorithms like Sinkhorn and Greenkhorn. Underlying our algorithm designs are two key elements: (a) converting the original problem into a bilinear minimax problem over probability distributions; (b) exploiting the extragradient idea -- in conjunction with entropy regularization and adaptive learning rates -- to accelerate convergence.</description>

      <title>TAP: The Attention Patch for Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer from Unlabeled Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a cross-modal learning framework, where the objective is to enhance the performance of supervised learning in the primary modality using an unlabeled, unpaired secondary modality. Taking a probabilistic approach for missing information estimation, we show that the extra information contained in the secondary modality can be estimated via Nadaraya-Watson (NW) kernel regression, which can further be expressed as a kernelized cross-attention module (under linear transformation). This expression lays the foundation for introducing The Attention Patch (TAP), a simple neural network add-on that can be trained to allow data-level knowledge transfer from the unlabeled modality. We provide extensive numerical simulations using real-world datasets to show that TAP can provide statistically significant improvement in generalization across different domains and different neural network architectures, making use of seemingly unusable unlabeled cross-modal data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06247v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of online multiclass classification where the learner predicts a single label but receives a \textit{set of labels} as feedback. In this model, the learner is penalized for not outputting a label contained in the revealed set. We show that unlike online multiclass learning with single-label feedback, deterministic and randomized online learnability are \textit{not equivalent} even in the realizable setting with set-valued feedback. Accordingly, we give two new combinatorial dimensions, named the Set Littlestone and Measure Shattering dimension, that tightly characterize deterministic and randomized online learnability respectively in the realizable setting. In addition, we show that the Measure Shattering dimension characterizes online learnability in the agnostic setting and tightly quantifies the minimax regret. Finally, we use our results to establish bounds on the minimax regret for three practical learning settings: online multilabel ranking, online multilabel classification, and real-valued prediction with interval-valued response.</description>

      <title>On the use of the Gram matrix for multivariate functional principal components analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimension reduction is crucial in functional data analysis (FDA). The key tool to reduce the dimension of the data is functional principal component analysis. Existing approaches for functional principal component analysis usually involve the diagonalization of the covariance operator. With the increasing size and complexity of functional datasets, estimating the covariance operator has become more challenging. Therefore, there is a growing need for efficient methodologies to estimate the eigencomponents. Using the duality of the space of observations and the space of functional features, we propose to use the inner-product between the curves to estimate the eigenelements of multivariate and multidimensional functional datasets. The relationship between the eigenelements of the covariance operator and those of the inner-product matrix is established. We explore the application of these methodologies in several FDA settings and provide general guidance on their usability.</description>

      <title>Apple Tasting: Combinatorial Dimensions and Minimax Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In online binary classification under \emph{apple tasting} feedback, the learner only observes the true label if it predicts ``1". First studied by \cite{helmbold2000apple}, we revisit this classical partial-feedback setting and study online learnability from a combinatorial perspective. We show that the Littlestone dimension continues to provide a tight quantitative characterization of apple tasting in the agnostic setting, closing an open question posed by \cite{helmbold2000apple}. In addition, we give a new combinatorial parameter, called the Effective width, that tightly quantifies the minimax expected mistakes in the realizable setting. As a corollary, we use the Effective width to establish a \emph{trichotomy} of the minimax expected number of mistakes in the realizable setting. In particular, we show that in the realizable setting, the expected number of mistakes of any learner, under apple tasting feedback, can be $\Theta(1), \Theta(\sqrt{T})$, or $\Theta(T)$. This is in contrast to the full-information realizable setting where only $\Theta(1)$ and $\Theta(T)$ are possible.</description>

      <title>Critical Influence of Overparameterization on Sharpness-aware Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training an overparameterized neural network can yield minimizers of different generalization capabilities despite the same level of training loss. Meanwhile, with evidence that suggests a strong correlation between the sharpness of minima and their generalization errors, increasing efforts have been made to develop optimization methods to explicitly find flat minima as more generalizable solutions. Despite its contemporary relevance to overparameterization, however, this sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) strategy has not been studied much yet as to exactly how it is affected by overparameterization. Hence, in this work, we analyze SAM under overparameterization of varying degrees and present both empirical and theoretical results that indicate a critical influence of overparameterization on SAM. At first, we conduct extensive numerical experiments across vision, language, graph, and reinforcement learning domains and show that SAM consistently improves with overparameterization. Next, we attribute this phenomenon to the interplay between the enlarged solution space and increased implicit bias from overparameterization. Further, we prove multiple theoretical benefits of overparameterization for SAM to attain (i) minima with more uniform Hessian moments compared to SGD, (ii) much faster convergence at a linear rate, and (iii) lower test error for two-layer networks. Last but not least, we discover that the effect of overparameterization is more significantly pronounced in practical settings of label noise and sparsity, and yet, sufficient regularization is necessary.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Non-separable Binary Classification and its Applications in Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inability to linearly classify XOR has motivated much of deep learning. We revisit this age-old problem and show that linear classification of XOR is indeed possible. Instead of separating data between halfspaces, we propose a slightly different paradigm, equality separation, that adapts the SVM objective to distinguish data within or outside the margin. Our classifier can then be integrated into neural network pipelines with a smooth approximation. From its properties, we intuit that equality separation is suitable for anomaly detection. To formalize this notion, we introduce closing numbers, a quantitative measure on the capacity for classifiers to form closed decision regions for anomaly detection. Springboarding from this theoretical connection between binary classification and anomaly detection, we test our hypothesis on supervised anomaly detection experiments, showing that equality separation can detect both seen and unseen anomalies.</description>

      <title>Precipitation Downscaling with Spatiotemporal Video Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In climate science and meteorology, high-resolution local precipitation (rain and snowfall) predictions are limited by the computational costs of simulation-based methods. Statistical downscaling, or super-resolution, is a common workaround where a low-resolution prediction is improved using statistical approaches. Unlike traditional computer vision tasks, weather and climate applications require capturing the accurate conditional distribution of high-resolution given low-resolution patterns to assure reliable ensemble averages and unbiased estimates of extreme events, such as heavy rain. This work extends recent video diffusion models to precipitation super-resolution, employing a deterministic downscaler followed by a temporally-conditioned diffusion model to capture noise characteristics and high-frequency patterns. We test our approach on FV3GFS output, an established large-scale global atmosphere model, and compare it against six state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis, capturing CRPS, MSE, precipitation distributions, and qualitative aspects using California and the Himalayas as examples, establishes our method as a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of an over-parametrized Transformer classifier learned by gradient descent</title>

Abstract: One of the most recent and fascinating breakthroughs in artificial intelligence is ChatGPT, a chatbot which can simulate human conversation. ChatGPT is an instance of GPT4, which is a language model based on generative gredictive gransformers. So if one wants to study from a theoretical point of view, how powerful such artificial intelligence can be, one approach is to consider transformer networks and to study which problems one can solve with these networks theoretically. Here it is not only important what kind of models these network can approximate, or how they can generalize their knowledge learned by choosing the best possible approximation to a concrete data set, but also how well optimization of such transformer network based on concrete data set works. In this article we consider all these three different aspects simultaneously and show a theoretical upper bound on the missclassification probability of a transformer network fitted to the observed data. For simplicity we focus in this context on transformer encoder networks which can be applied to define an estimate in the context of a classification problem involving natural language.</description>

      <title>What Will My Model Forget? Forecasting Forgotten Examples in Language Model Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models deployed in the wild make errors. However, simply updating the model with the corrected error instances causes catastrophic forgetting -- the updated model makes errors on instances learned during the instruction tuning or upstream training phase. Randomly replaying upstream data yields unsatisfactory performance and often comes with high variance and poor controllability. To this end, we try to forecast upstream examples that will be forgotten due to a model update for improved controllability of the replay process and interpretability. We train forecasting models given a collection of online learned examples and corresponding forgotten upstream pre-training examples. We propose a partially interpretable forecasting model based on the observation that changes in pre-softmax logit scores of pretraining examples resemble that of online learned examples, which performs decently on BART but fails on T5 models. We further show a black-box classifier based on inner products of example representations achieves better forecasting performance over a series of setups. Finally, we show that we reduce forgetting of upstream pretraining examples by replaying examples that are forecasted to be forgotten, demonstrating the practical utility of forecasting example forgetting.</description>

      <title>Discounted Adaptive Online Learning: Towards Better Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study online learning in adversarial nonstationary environments. Since the future can be very different from the past, a critical challenge is to gracefully forget the history while new data comes in. To formalize this intuition, we revisit the discounted regret in online convex optimization, and propose an adaptive (i.e., instance optimal), FTRL-based algorithm that improves the widespread non-adaptive baseline -- gradient descent with a constant learning rate. From a practical perspective, this refines the classical idea of regularization in lifelong learning: we show that designing good regularizers can be guided by the principled theory of adaptive online optimization.
  Complementing this result, we also consider the (Gibbs and Cand\`es, 2021)-style online conformal prediction problem, where the goal is to sequentially predict the uncertainty sets of a black-box machine learning model. We show that the FTRL nature of our algorithm can simplify the conventional gradient-descent-based analysis, leading to instance-dependent performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Anatomically-Controllable Medical Image Generation with Segmentation-Guided Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05210v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have enabled remarkably high-quality medical image generation, yet it is challenging to enforce anatomical constraints in generated images. To this end, we propose a diffusion model-based method that supports anatomically-controllable medical image generation, by following a multi-class anatomical segmentation mask at each sampling step. We additionally introduce a random mask ablation training algorithm to enable conditioning on a selected combination of anatomical constraints while allowing flexibility in other anatomical areas. We compare our method ("SegGuidedDiff") to existing methods on breast MRI and abdominal/neck-to-pelvis CT datasets with a wide range of anatomical objects. Results show that our method reaches a new state-of-the-art in the faithfulness of generated images to input anatomical masks on both datasets, and is on par for general anatomical realism. Finally, our model also enjoys the extra benefit of being able to adjust the anatomical similarity of generated images to real images of choice through interpolation in its latent space. SegGuidedDiff has many applications, including cross-modality translation, and the generation of paired or counterfactual data. Our code is available at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/segmentation-guided-diffusion.</description>

      <title>The Mirrored Influence Hypothesis: Efficient Data Influence Estimation by Harnessing Forward Passes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale black-box models have become ubiquitous across numerous applications. Understanding the influence of individual training data sources on predictions made by these models is crucial for improving their trustworthiness. Current influence estimation techniques involve computing gradients for every training point or repeated training on different subsets. These approaches face obvious computational challenges when scaled up to large datasets and models.
  In this paper, we introduce and explore the Mirrored Influence Hypothesis, highlighting a reciprocal nature of influence between training and test data. Specifically, it suggests that evaluating the influence of training data on test predictions can be reformulated as an equivalent, yet inverse problem: assessing how the predictions for training samples would be altered if the model were trained on specific test samples. Through both empirical and theoretical validations, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our hypothesis. Inspired by this, we introduce a new method for estimating the influence of training data, which requires calculating gradients for specific test samples, paired with a forward pass for each training point. This approach can capitalize on the common asymmetry in scenarios where the number of test samples under concurrent examination is much smaller than the scale of the training dataset, thus gaining a significant improvement in efficiency compared to existing approaches.
  We demonstrate the applicability of our method across a range of scenarios, including data attribution in diffusion models, data leakage detection, analysis of memorization, mislabeled data detection, and tracing behavior in language models. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/ruoxi-jia-group/Forward-INF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pareto front profiling in multi-objective optimization (MOO), i.e. finding a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions, is challenging, especially with expensive objectives like neural network training. Typically, in MOO neural architecture search (NAS), we aim to balance performance and hardware metrics across devices. Prior NAS approaches simplify this task by incorporating hardware constraints into the objective function, but profiling the Pareto front necessitates a computationally expensive search for each constraint. In this work, we propose a novel NAS algorithm that encodes user preferences for the trade-off between performance and hardware metrics, and yields representative and diverse architectures across multiple devices in just one search run. To this end, we parameterize the joint architectural distribution across devices and multiple objectives via a hypernetwork that can be conditioned on hardware features and preference vectors, enabling zero-shot transferability to new devices. Extensive experiments with up to 19 hardware devices and 3 objectives showcase the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Finally, we show that, without extra costs, our method outperforms existing MOO NAS methods across a broad range of qualitatively different search spaces and datasets, including MobileNetV3 on ImageNet-1k, an encoder-decoder transformer space for machine translation and a decoder-only transformer space for language modelling.</description>

      <title>Active Adaptive Experimental Design for Treatment Effect Estimation with Covariate Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study designs an adaptive experiment for efficiently estimating average treatment effects (ATEs). In each round of our adaptive experiment, an experimenter sequentially samples an experimental unit, assigns a treatment, and observes the corresponding outcome immediately. At the end of the experiment, the experimenter estimates an ATE using the gathered samples. The objective is to estimate the ATE with a smaller asymptotic variance. Existing studies have designed experiments that adaptively optimize the propensity score (treatment-assignment probability). As a generalization of such an approach, we propose optimizing the covariate density as well as the propensity score. First, we derive the efficient covariate density and propensity score that minimize the semiparametric efficiency bound and find that optimizing both covariate density and propensity score minimizes the semiparametric efficiency bound more effectively than optimizing only the propensity score. Next, we design an adaptive experiment using the efficient covariate density and propensity score sequentially estimated during the experiment. Lastly, we propose an ATE estimator whose asymptotic variance aligns with the minimized semiparametric efficiency bound.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum simulation: a case study for understanding warm starts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real and imaginary time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time-step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial size time-steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training.</description>

      <title>Lazy Data Practices Harm Fairness Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data practices shape research and practice on fairness in machine learning (fair ML). Critical data studies offer important reflections and critiques for the responsible advancement of the field by highlighting shortcomings and proposing recommendations for improvement. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of fair ML datasets, demonstrating how unreflective yet common practices hinder the reach and reliability of algorithmic fairness findings. We systematically study protected information encoded in tabular datasets and their usage in 280 experiments across 142 publications.
  Our analyses identify three main areas of concern: (1) a \textbf{lack of representation for certain protected attributes} in both data and evaluations; (2) the widespread \textbf{exclusion of minorities} during data preprocessing; and (3) \textbf{opaque data processing} threatening the generalization of fairness research. By conducting exemplary analyses on the utilization of prominent datasets, we demonstrate how unreflective data decisions disproportionately affect minority groups, fairness metrics, and resultant model comparisons. Additionally, we identify supplementary factors such as limitations in publicly available data, privacy considerations, and a general lack of awareness, which exacerbate these challenges. To address these issues, we propose a set of recommendations for data usage in fairness research centered on transparency and responsible inclusion. This study underscores the need for a critical reevaluation of data practices in fair ML and offers directions to improve both the sourcing and usage of datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning Linear Utility Functions From Pairwise Comparison Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study learnability of linear utility functions from pairwise comparison queries. In particular, we consider two learning objectives. The first objective is to predict out-of-sample responses to pairwise comparisons, whereas the second is to approximately recover the true parameters of the utility function. We show that in the passive learning setting, linear utilities are efficiently learnable with respect to the first objective, both when query responses are uncorrupted by noise, and under Tsybakov noise when the distributions are sufficiently "nice". In contrast, we show that utility parameters are not learnable for a large set of data distributions without strong modeling assumptions, even when query responses are noise-free. Next, we proceed to analyze the learning problem in an active learning setting. In this case, we show that even the second objective is efficiently learnable, and present algorithms for both the noise-free and noisy query response settings. Our results thus exhibit a qualitative learnability gap between passive and active learning from pairwise preference queries, demonstrating the value of the ability to select pairwise queries for utility learning.</description>

      <title>FedConPE: Efficient Federated Conversational Bandits with Heterogeneous Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems have emerged as a potent solution for efficiently eliciting user preferences. These systems interactively present queries associated with "key terms" to users and leverage user feedback to estimate user preferences more efficiently. Nonetheless, most existing algorithms adopt a centralized approach. In this paper, we introduce FedConPE, a phase elimination-based federated conversational bandit algorithm, where $M$ agents collaboratively solve a global contextual linear bandit problem with the help of a central server while ensuring secure data management. To effectively coordinate all the clients and aggregate their collected data, FedConPE uses an adaptive approach to construct key terms that minimize uncertainty across all dimensions in the feature space. Furthermore, compared with existing federated linear bandit algorithms, FedConPE offers improved computational and communication efficiency as well as enhanced privacy protections. Our theoretical analysis shows that FedConPE is minimax near-optimal in terms of cumulative regret. We also establish upper bounds for communication costs and conversation frequency. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that FedConPE outperforms existing conversational bandit algorithms while using fewer conversations.</description>

      <title>Biology-inspired joint distribution neurons based on Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction allowing for multidirectional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Popular artificial neural networks (ANN) optimize parameters for unidirectional value propagation, assuming some arbitrary parametrization type like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). In contrast, for biological neurons e.g. "it is not uncommon for axonal propagation of action potentials to happen in both directions"~\cite{axon} - suggesting they are optimized to continuously operate in multidirectional way. Additionally, statistical dependencies a single neuron could model is not just (expected) value dependence, but entire joint distributions including also higher moments. Such more agnostic joint distribution neuron would allow for multidirectional propagation (of distributions or values) e.g. $\rho(x|y,z)$ or $\rho(y,z|x)$ by substituting to $\rho(x,y,z)$ and normalizing. There will be discussed Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction (HCR) for such neuron model: assuming $\rho(x,y,z)=\sum_{ijk} a_{ijk} f_i(x) f_j(y) f_k(z)$ type parametrization of joint distribution in polynomial basis $f_i$, which allows for flexible, inexpensive processing including nonlinearities, direct model estimation and update, trained through standard backpropagation or novel ways for such structure up to tensor decomposition or information bottleneck approach. Using only pairwise (input-output) dependencies, its expected value prediction becomes KAN-like with trained activation functions as polynomials, can be extended by adding higher order dependencies through included products - in conscious interpretable way, allowing for multidirectional propagation of both values and probability densities.</description>

      <title>The Real Price of Bandit Information in Multiclass Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of multiclass classification with bandit feedback (Kakade, Shalev-Shwartz and Tewari, 2008), where each input classifies to one of $K$ possible labels and feedback is restricted to whether the predicted label is correct or not. Our primary inquiry is with regard to the dependency on the number of labels $K$, and whether $T$-step regret bounds in this setting can be improved beyond the $\smash{\sqrt{KT}}$ dependence exhibited by existing algorithms. Our main contribution is in showing that the minimax regret of bandit multiclass is in fact more nuanced, and is of the form $\smash{\widetilde{\Theta}\left(\min \left\{|H| + \sqrt{T}, \sqrt{KT \log |H|} \right\} \right) }$, where $H$ is the underlying (finite) hypothesis class. In particular, we present a new bandit classification algorithm that guarantees regret $\smash{\widetilde{O}(|H|+\sqrt{T})}$, improving over classical algorithms for moderately-sized hypothesis classes, and give a matching lower bound establishing tightness of the upper bounds (up to log-factors) in all parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free uniform concentration bound for logistic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a novel dimension-free uniform concentration bound for the empirical risk function of constrained logistic regression. Our bound yields a milder sufficient condition for a uniform law of large numbers than conditions derived by the Rademacher complexity argument and McDiarmid's inequality. The derivation is based on the PAC-Bayes approach with second-order expansion and Rademacher-complexity-based bounds for the residual term of the expansion.</description>

      <title>The Empirical Impact of Neural Parameter Symmetries, or Lack Thereof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms and observed phenomena in deep learning appear to be affected by parameter symmetries -- transformations of neural network parameters that do not change the underlying neural network function. These include linear mode connectivity, model merging, Bayesian neural network inference, metanetworks, and several other characteristics of optimization or loss-landscapes. However, theoretical analysis of the relationship between parameter space symmetries and these phenomena is difficult. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of neural parameter symmetries by introducing new neural network architectures that have reduced parameter space symmetries. We develop two methods, with some provable guarantees, of modifying standard neural networks to reduce parameter space symmetries. With these new methods, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study consisting of multiple tasks aimed at assessing the effect of removing parameter symmetries. Our experiments reveal several interesting observations on the empirical impact of parameter symmetries; for instance, we observe linear mode connectivity between our networks without alignment of weight spaces, and we find that our networks allow for faster and more effective Bayesian neural network training.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil: Robust backdoor attack via Stochastic investment models and Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of voice-activated systems and speech recognition technologies, the danger of backdoor attacks on audio data has grown significantly. This research looks at a specific type of attack, known as a Stochastic investment-based backdoor attack (MarketBack), in which adversaries strategically manipulate the stylistic properties of audio to fool speech recognition systems. The security and integrity of machine learning models are seriously threatened by backdoor attacks, in order to maintain the reliability of audio applications and systems, the identification of such attacks becomes crucial in the context of audio data. Experimental results demonstrated that MarketBack is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 100% in seven victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large matrices arise in many machine learning and data analysis applications, including as representations of datasets, graphs, model weights, and first and second-order derivatives. Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) is an area which uses randomness to develop improved algorithms for ubiquitous matrix problems. The area has reached a certain level of maturity; but recent hardware trends, efforts to incorporate RandNLA algorithms into core numerical libraries, and advances in machine learning, statistics, and random matrix theory, have lead to new theoretical and practical challenges. This article provides a self-contained overview of RandNLA, in light of these developments.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Conceptual Explainers: Trustworthy Conceptual Explanations for Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT's predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of the defined desiderata.</description>
