      <title>Solitons with irrational charge in a one-dimensional quantum ferroelectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use analytic (mean-field) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to study a simplified one-dimensional version of the SSH-Holstein model of electron-phonon interactions with one electron per site (half filling) where, as a function of the ratio of the two couplings, three distinct insulating phases arise - a site-centered charge-density-wave (CDW), a bond-centered bond-density-wave (BDW), and an intermediate ferroelectric (inversion-symmetry breaking) phase with coexisting CDW and BDW order. In the intermediate phase our DMRG results establish the existence of point-like soliton excitations with irrational charge (that depends on a ratio of coupling constants) and either spin 1/2 or spin 0, and a surprisingly light effective mass.</description>

      <title>Edge Spin fractionalization in one-dimensional spin-$S$ quantum antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the anisotropic quantum spin chain with spin $S$ (XXZ$-S$) exhibits exponentially localized fractional $\pm \frac{S}{2}$ edge modes in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase of the model. Moreover, we claim that this phenomenon is very general and exists in any $U(1)$ symmetric spin chain in its gapped antiferromagnetic regime with explicitly or spontaneously broken $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry. We examine our argument for integrable and non integrable chains. By using the Bethe Ansatz method, we show that $XXZ-\frac{1}{2}$ and a $XXZ-1$ integrable chains have $\pm \frac{S}{2}$ fractionalized edge modes. Employing the density matrix renormalization group technique, we extend this analysis to {\it generic} XXZ-$S$ chains with $S\leq 3$ and demonstrate that these fractional spins emerge as robust quantum observables, substantiated by the observation of a variance of the associated fractional spin operators that is consistent with a vanishing functional form in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we find that the edge modes are robust to disorder that couples to the N\'eel order parameter.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance of a bulk sample of FeSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetoresistance, MR of a well-characterized bulk FeSi sample was studied. It is shown that after a chaotic behavior at temperatures below 6 K, the magnetoresistance of FeSi becomes regular functions of temperature and magnetic field. The observations suggest that the mean free path of carriers defines along with the unknown negative component the negative values of magnetoresistance of FeSi then approaching zero values at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Long-range magnetic order induced surface state in GdBi and DyBi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of unconventional surface-state pairs, which give rise to Fermi arcs and spin textures, in antiferromagnetically ordered rare-earth monopnictides attracted the interest in these materials. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the evolution of the electronic structure of GdBi and DyBi. We find that new surface states, including a Dirac cone, emerge in the AFM state. However, they are located along a direction in momentum space that is different than what was found in NdSb, NdBi, and CeBi. The observed changes in the electronic structure are consistent with the presence of AFM-II-A type order.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy construction for non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states via anyon condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given parent fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state at filling fraction $\nu$, the hierarchy construction produces FQH states at nearby filling fractions $\{\nu_n\}$ by condensing minimally charged quasiholes or quasiparticles of the parent state into their own FQH states. The hierarchy construction has been useful for relating families of FQH states and for the experimental identification of the topological order of parent states via the presence of daughter states. We reinterpret the hierarchy construction as a two-step procedure: stacking with a second FQH state and condensing a condensable algebra of bosons. This two-step procedure can be applied to both abelian and non-abelian FQH states, and it does not require calculations with a wavefunction. We show this construction reproduces the hierarchies for the Laughlin and Pfaffian states, and can be applied further to propose hierarchies for various non-abelian FQH states.</description>

      <title>Mott physics and universal Planckian relaxation in the high-Tc cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortly after the discovery of high-temperature superconducting cuprates, Anderson proposed that Mott physics is instrumental in understanding their phase diagrams. Specifically, he suggested that, similar to the 'almost-localized' Fermi liquid in 3He, the effective mass renormalization in the cuprates is characteristic of a doped Mott insulator, scaling inversely with doping p away from half-filling. However, Mott physics has struggled to account for the 'strange metal' behavior, characterized by a linear-in-temperature (T) 'Planckian' resistivity that extends to very high temperatures, casting doubt on the relevance of Mott physics in the cuprates. Here, we report a comprehensive survey of calorimetry and resistivity data spanning broad doping and temperature ranges. We find that the entropy at high temperatures closely adheres to that of an almost-localized Fermi liquid, implying that Mott physics remains relevant at high energies. We find that the strong doping dependence of the coefficient of the T-linear resistivity at high temperatures also scales inversely with p, suggesting a true universality of the Planckian relaxation rate across the entire phase diagram. Thus, the physics of the cuprates over their entire phase diagram is determined by the joint action of Mott physics and Planckian relaxation physics, with each operating at very different energy scales.</description>

      <title>The Green's function Monte Carlo combined with projected entangled pair state approach to the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor network algorithm, a family of prevalent numerical methods for quantum many-body problems, aptly captures the entanglement properties intrinsic to quantum systems, enabling precise representation of quantum states. However, its computational cost is notably high, particularly in calculating physical observables like correlation functions. To surmount the computational challenge and enhance efficiency, we propose integrating the Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method with the projected entangled pair state (PEPS) ansatz. This approach combines the high-efficiency characteristics of Monte Carlo with the sign-free nature of tensor network states and proves effective in addressing the computational bottleneck. To showcase its prowess, we apply this hybrid approach to investigate the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice, a model notorious for its sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results reveal a substantial improvement in the accuracy of ground-state energy when utilizing a preliminary PEPS as the guiding wave function for GFMC. By calculating the structure factor and spin-spin correlation functions, we further characterize the phase diagram, identifying a possible columnar valence-bond state phase within the intermediate parameter range of $0.52 &lt; J_2/J_1 &lt; 0.58$. This comprehensive study underscores the efficacy of our combined approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate frustrated quantum spin systems while ensuring computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Emergence and evolution of electronic modes with temperature in spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic modes emerge within the band gap at nonzero temperature in strongly correlated insulators such as Mott and Kondo insulators, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. As the temperature increases, the emergent modes gain considerable spectral weights and form robust bands that differ from the zero-temperature bands. Here, the origin of the emergent modes, their relation to doping-induced modes, and how their spectral weights increase with temperature are clarified in the ladder and bilayer Hubbard models and one- and two-dimensional Kondo lattice models using effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping and numerical calculations. The results indicate that the temperature-driven change in the band structure reflecting spin excitation, including the change in the number of bands, can be observed in various strongly correlated insulators even with a spin gap, provided that the temperature increases up to about spin-excitation energies. The controlled analyses developed in this study significantly contribute to the fundamental understanding of the band structure of strongly correlated insulators at nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Cluster-projected matrix product state: framework for engineering exact quantum many-body ground states in one and two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework to design concurrently a frustration-free quantum many-body Hamiltonian and its exact ground states in one and two dimensions using an elementary matrix product state (MPS) representation. Our approach strategically chooses a local cluster Hamiltonian, which is arranged to overlap with neighboring clusters on a designed lattice. Ensuring that there exists a state spanned on the lattice that has its local submanifolds as the lowest-energy eigenstate of every cluster, we can construct the bulk Hamiltonian as the sum of the cluster Hamiltonians. The key to find such a solution is a systematic protocol, which projects out excited states on every cluster using MPS and effectively entangles the cluster states. The protocol offers several advantages, including the ability to achieve exact many-body ground-state solutions at nearly equal cost in one and two dimensions including those with gapless or long-range entangled ground states, flexibility in designing Hamiltonians unbiasedly across various forms of models, and numerically feasible validation through energy calculations. Our protocol offers exact ground state for any given-frustration free Hamiltonian, and enables the exploration of exact phase boundaries and the analysis of even a spatially nonuniform random system, providing platforms for quantum simulations and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating field series: towards calculations of correlated systems with high accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce regular series expansion for weakly- and moderately-correlated fermionic systems, based on Fluctuating Local Field approach. The method relies on the explicit account of leading fluctuating mode(s) and is therefore suitable for medium-sized lattices. It can be also used as a solver for the cluster approximations for infinite-size lattices. We introduce classical fluctuating field coupled to fermionic collective mode(s). This way, fluctuations in selected modes are treated in a non-perturbative way. Other degrees of freedom are accounted for the diagram expansion performed at each value of the fluctuating field. The method is benchmarked for the $U/t=1$ and $U/t=2$ Hubbard lattices at half-filling. Results for susceptibility in the antiferromagnetic channel along with the single particle density of states are compared with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo data. Calculations up to the third order of the series expansion are performed and show a uniform convergence to the reference result for the susceptibility. This convergence is observed well below the DMFT Ne\'el temperature and makes our practically simple method applicable in a much wider temperature range than DMFT-based diagrammatic schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of dielectric relaxation by quantum critical magnons in Cs$_2$Cu$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{12}$, we conduct a detailed analysis of its dielectric response and compare it to that in the isostructural compound Rb$_2$Cu$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{12}$. Measurements in the vicinity of the field-induced magnon softening show that its description in terms of 3D Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons quantum critical point is unaltered by the presence of dielectric relaxation. We also demonstrate the existence of dielectric relaxation anomalies at 19 K in Rb$_2$Cu$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{12}$ and discuss the implications for the microscopic origin of dielectric activity in two compounds.</description>

      <title>Spin-Peierls instability of deconfined quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) are putative phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm with emergent fractionalized degrees of freedom. The original example of a DQCP is the spin-1/2 quantum antiferromagnet on the square lattice which features a second order transition between valence bond solid (VBS) and N\'eel order. The VBS order breaks a lattice symmetry, and the corresponding VBS order parameter may couple to lattice distortion modes (phonons) at appropriate momenta. We investigate a field-theoretic description of the DQCP in the presence of such a spin-lattice coupling. We show that treating phonons as classical lattice distortions leads to a relevant monopole-phonon interaction inducing an instability towards a distorted lattice by an analogous mechanism to the spin-Peierls instability in one dimension. Consequently, there is a breakdown of the DQCP which generally becomes a strong first-order transition. Taking into account the full quantum nature of the phonons, we argue that the continuous DQCP persists above a critical phonon frequency. Lastly, we comment on the connection to general gapless, deconfined gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Theory of Coulomb driven nematicity in a multi-valley two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a semiconductor host with two valleys related by an underlying $C_4$ rotational symmetry are studied using Hartree-Fock (HF) and various other many-body approaches. A familiar artifact of the HF approach is a degeneracy between the valley polarized - ``Ising nematic'' - and spin polarized - ferromagnetic - phases, which is inconsistent with recent variational Monte Carlo (VMC) results. Correlation effects, computed either within the random phase approximation (RPA) or the T-matrix approximation, enhance the valley susceptibility relative to the spin susceptibility. Extrapolating the results to finite interaction strength, we find a direct first-order transition from a symmetry-unbroken state to a spin unpolarized Ising nematic fluid with full valley polarization, in qualitative agreement with VMC. The RPA results are also reminiscent of experiments on the corresponding 2DEG in AlAs heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Patel et.al introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar with vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector as well as scalar interaction, although the details are very different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimension not in higher dimension independent of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the role of spatial random disorder and find a simple understanding how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to the strange metal by changing the behavior of the self-energies of involved boson and fermion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states and identify a family of organic semiconductors exhibiting the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through chemical functionalisation and through the dielectric environment of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for linear response theory in cavity QED materials. Our approach leverages the collective coupling between light and matter, drawing parallels with large-N theories in quantum field theory. We derive closed formulas for various responses of both the cavity and the matter. Our theory is validated by recovering established results for the Dicke model and the Quantum Hall Effect. Additionally, we discover novel excitations in quantum magnets, where the cavity binds magnon pairs into localized states.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity QED materials: Comparison and validation of two linear response theories at arbitrary light-matter coupling strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for materials collectively coupled to a cavity that is valid in all regimes of light-matter coupling, including symmetry-broken phases. We present and compare two different approaches. First, using a coherent path integral formulation for the partition function to obtain thermal Green functions. This approach relies on a saddle point expansion for the action, that can be truncated in the thermodynamic limit. Second, by formulating the equations of motion for the retarded Green functions and solving them. We use a mean-field decoupling of high-order Green functions in order to obtain a closed, solvable system of equations. Both approaches yield identical results in the calculation of response functions for the cavity and material. These are obtained in terms of the bare cavity and material responses. In combination, the two techniques clarify the validity of a mean-field decoupling in correlated light-matter systems and provide complementary means to compute finite-size corrections to the thermodynamic limit. The theory is formulated for a general model that encompasses most of the systems typically considered in the field of cavity QED materials, within a long-wavelength approximation. Finally, we provide a detailed application of the theory to the Quantum Hall effect and to a collection of magnetic models. We validate our predictions against analytical and finite-size exact-diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>Inevitable First Order Phase Transitions in 3D Quantum Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that low carrier density three-dimensional (3D) metals ZrTe$_5$ and HfTe$_5$ exhibit the 3D quantum Hall (QH) effect with Hall resistivity plateaus and a metal-insulator transition in strong magnetic fields. The conventional 3D QH theory requires a fixed period charge density wave (CDW), which is however not observed experimentally. We investigate alternative non-CDW mechanisms by considering a 3D metal in strong magnetic fields with electrons coupled to a boson (e.g., phonon) field. We show that the model exhibits inevitable first order phase transitions at jumps of the number of occupied Landau level bands, which do not involve CDW. These transitions may drive the system into a phase separation state with percolation transitions. We further show this can lead to Hall resistivity quasi-plateaus similar to that observed experimentally, and can provide a natural explanation for the metal-insulator transition.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Quantum Geometric Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations of many-body electron systems can carry internal structure, tied to the quantum geometry of the Hilbert space in which they are embedded. This has been shown explicitly for particle-hole-like excitations, which carry a ``quantum geometric dipole'' (QGD) that is essentially an electric dipole moment associated with the state. We demonstrate in this work that this property can be formulated in a generic way, which does not require wavefunctions expressed in terms of single particle-hole states. Our formulation exploits the density matrix associated with a branch of excitations that evolves continuously with its momentum ${\bf K}$, from which one may extract single-particle states allowing a construction of the QGD. We demonstrate the formulation using the single-mode approximation for excited states of two quantum Hall systems: the first for an integrally filled Landau level, and the second for a fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor $\nu=1/m$, with $m$ an odd integer. In both cases we obtain the same result for the QGD, which can be attributed to the translational invariance assumed of the system. Our study demonstrates that the QGD is an intrinsic property of collective modes which is valid beyond approximations one might make for their wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Exploring $G$-ality defects in 2-dim QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPT before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries correspond to invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible $\textit{$G$-ality defects}$. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification is acquired previously by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N &lt; 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</description>

      <title>Entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Lindblad quantum dynamics from correlation functions of classical spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad quantum master equation is one of the central approaches to the physics of open quantum systems. In particular, boundary driving enables the study of transport, where a steady state emerges in the long-time limit, which features a constant current and a characteristic density profile. While the Lindblad equation complements other approaches to transport in closed quantum systems, it has become clear that a connection between closed and open systems exists in certain cases. Here, we build on this connection for magnetization transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with and without integrability-breaking perturbations. Specifically, we show that the time evolution of the open quantum system can be described on the basis of classical correlation functions, as generated by the Hamiltonian equations of motion for real vectors. By comparing to exact numerical simulations of the Lindblad equation, we demonstrate the accuracy of this description for a range of model parameters, but also point out counterexamples. While this agreement is an interesting physical observation, it also suggests that classical mechanics can be used to solve the Lindblad equation for comparatively large system sizes, which lie outside the possibilities of a quantum mechanical treatment.</description>

      <title>Realization of a classical Ruddlesden Popper type bilayer nickelate in Sr$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_{7-\delta}$ with unusual Ni$^{4+}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of 80 K superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at pressures greater than 14 GPa presents a unique opportunity to study a novel class of high-temperature superconductors. Therefore, other bilayer nickelate following the classical ($T^{4+}$) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) series of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ would present an interesting new candidate. In this work, we study the stabilization of RP $n=2$ phase in Sr$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$, via floating zone growth of crystals. With powder and single crystal XRD, we study the stability range of the RP-type phase. Our Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas extraction studies reveal a remarkably high oxidation state of Ni$^{4+}$. The obtained black crystals are insulating in transport and show a magnetic transition around 12 K.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Dyson equation: derivation and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 216401] we presented the multichannel Dyson equation (MCDE) in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. In this work we will give further details of the MCDE approach. In particular we will discuss: 1) the derivation of the MCDE and the definition of the space in which it is to be solved; 2) the rationale of the approximation to the multichannel self-energy; 3) a diagrammatic analysis of the MCDE; 4) the recasting of the MCDE on an eigenvalue problem with an effective Hamiltonian that can be solved using standard numerical techniques. This work mainly focuses on the coupling between the one-body Green's function and the three-body Green's function to describe photoemission spectra, but the MCDE method can be generalized to the coupling of other many-body Green's functions and to other spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Using operator covariance to disentangle scaling dimensions in lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In critical lattice models, distance ($r$) dependent correlation functions contain power laws $r^{-2\Delta}$ governed by scaling dimensions $\Delta$ of an underlying continuum field theory. In Monte Carlo simulations and other numerical approaches, the leading dimensions can be extracted by data fitting, which can be difficult when two or more powers contribute significantly. Here a method utilizing covariance between multiple lattice operators is developed where the $r$ dependent eigenvalues of the covariance matrix represent scaling dimensions of individual field operators. The scheme is tested on symmetric operators in the two-dimensional tricritical Blume-Capel model, where the two relevant dimensions, as well as some irrelevant ones, are isolated along with their corresponding eigenvectors. The method will be broadly useful in studies of classical and quantum models at multicritical points and for targeting irrelevant operators at simple critical (or multicritical) points.</description>

      <title>Coherence Length of Electronic Nematicity in Iron-Based Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM) advance the visualization of electronic nematicity and nematic domain structures in iron-based superconductors. In FeSe and BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.87}$P$_{0.13}$)$_2$ superconductors, it has been reported that the thickness of the electronic nematic domain walls is unexpectedly long, leading to the formation of mesoscopic nematicity wave [T. Shimojima $\textit{et al.}$, Science $\textbf{373}$ (2021) 1122]. This finding demonstrates that the nematic coherence length $\xi_{\rm nem}$ can be decoupled from the lattice domain wall. Here, we report that the electronic domain wall thickness shows a distinct variation in related materials: it is similarly long in FeSe$_{0.9}$S$_{0.1}$ whereas it is much shorter in undoped BaFe$_2$As$_2$. We find a correlation between the thick domain walls and the non-Fermi liquid properties of normal-state resistivity above the nematic transition temperature. This suggests that the nematic coherence length can be enhanced by underlying spin-orbital fluctuations responsible for the anomalous transport properties.</description>

      <title>Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci string-net condensate, a complex topological state that supports non-Abelian anyon excitations, holds promise for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. However, its realization by a static-lattice Hamiltonian has remained elusive due to the inherent high-order interactions demanded. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, that can dynamically prepare the state through reconfigurable graphs. DSNP enables the creation and manipulation of the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC). Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with a composite error-mitigation strategy on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid Fibonacci anyons in two spatial dimensions (2D) demonstrating their potential for universal quantum computation. To this end, we measure anyon charges for two species of anyons associated with the doubled topological quantum field theory underlying Fid-SNC, with an average experimental accuracy of 94%. We validate that a scalable 2D braiding operation on a logical qubit encoded on three anyons yields the golden ratio $\phi$ with 98% average accuracy and 8% measurement uncertainty. We further sample the Fib-SNC wavefunction to estimate the chromatic polynomial at $\phi+2$ for various graphs. Given the established computational hardness of the chromatic polynomial, the wavefunction amplitude is classically hard to evaluate. Our results establish the first proof of principle that scalable DSNP can open doors to fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and to classically-hard problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index in a spinful two dimensional insulator indicates the presence of an odd, quantized (pseudo)spin-resolved Chern number, $C_{s}=(C_{\uparrow}-C_{\downarrow})/2$. However, the statement is not biconditional. An odd spin-Chern number can survive when the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index vanishes. Identification of solid-state systems hosting an odd, quantized $C_{s}$ and trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index is a pressing issue due to the potential for such insulators to admit band gaps optimal for experiments and quantum devices. Nevertheless, they have proven elusive due to the computational expense associated with their discovery. In this work, a neural network capable of identifying the spin-Chern number is developed and used to identify the first solid-state systems hosting a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index and odd $C_{s}$. We demonstrate the potential of one such system, Ti$_{2}$CO$_{2}$, to support Majorana corner modes via the superconducting proximity effect.</description>

Abstract: The natural existence of crystalline symmetry in real materials manifests the importance of understanding crystalline symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, especially for interacting systems. In this paper, we systematically construct and classify all the crystalline topological superconductors and insulators in three-dimensional (3D) interacting fermion systems using the novel concept of topological crystal. The corresponding higher-order topological surface theory can also be systematically studied via higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence. In particular, we discover an intriguing fact that almost all topological crystals with nontrivial 2D block states are intrinsically interacting topological phases that cannot be realized in any free-fermion systems. Moreover, the crystalline equivalence principle for 3D interacting fermionic systems is also verified, with an additional subtle "twist" on the spin of fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent years, the thermal Hall transport has risen as an important diagnosis of the physical properties of the elementary excitations in various quantum materials, especially among the Mott insulating systems where the electronic transports are often featureless. Here we review the recent development of thermal Hall effects in quantum magnets where all the relevant excitations are charge-neutral. In addition to summarizing the existing experiments, we pay a special attention to the underlying mechanisms of the thermal Hall effects in various magnetic systems, and clarify the connection between the microscopic physical variables and the emergent degrees of freedom in different quantum phases. The external magnetic field is shown to modify the intrinsic Berry curvature properties of various emergent and/or exotic quasiparticle excitations in distinct fashions for different quantum systems and quantum phases, contributing to the thermal Hall transports. These include, for example, the conventional ones like the magnons in ordered magnets, the triplons in dimerized magnets, the exotic and fractionalized quasiparticles such as the spinons and the magnetic monopoles in quantum spin liquids. We review their contribution and discuss their presence in the thermal Hall conductivity in different physical contexts. We expect this review to provide a useful guidance for the physical mechanism of the thermal Hall transports in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Dark Fermions in Fluctuating Valence Insulators</title>

Abstract: A fluctuating-valence impurity in a metal is quantum-critical unlike a Kondo impurity which has the properties of a local Fermi-liquid. A systematic theory for the fluctuating-valence lattice is constructed, based on the hybridization and pairing of itinerant d-orbitals with localized f-orbitals both of which are essential parts of the solution of the impurity problem. It also uses the fact that the single-particle excitations at the Fermi-surface in any dimension can be written as orthogonal Majoranas and those with linear departures from the Fermi-surface as linear combination of bare particles and holes with the same spin. The calculations on the lattice give four spin-degenerate one-particle excitations of fractionalized fermions; two sets disperse across the chemical potential and the other two have gaps. The former are shown to be dark to any linear electro-magnetic probes of their charge and spin and observable only through probes of their free-energy such as a Fermi-liquid specific heat and magneto-oscillations characteristic of a Fermi-surface but without a Zeeman splitting. The excitations with the gaps behave as in insulators but with renormalized amplitudes. The superfluid density is zero. A magnetic field $H$ turns the insulator to a metal with a singularity in magnetization proportional to $\sqrt{H - H_c}$, with $H_c$ related to the gap. Beyond $H_c$, the usual Zeeman splitting appears in the magneto-oscillations. The properties and predictions are compared to the momentous recent discoveries in fluctuating-valence insulators. Similar excitations may be expected in transition metal chalcogenide layers at fluctuating-valence, and quite likely for Kagome lattices, and twisted multi-layer graphene near specific fillings.</description>

      <title>Variational optimization of the amplitude of neural-network quantum many-body ground states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQSs), variationally optimized by combining traditional methods and deep learning techniques, is a new way to find quantum many-body ground states and gradually becomes a competitor of traditional variational methods. However, there are still some difficulties in the optimization of NQSs, such as local minima, slow convergence, and sign structure optimization. Here, we split a quantum many-body variational wave function into a multiplication of a real-valued amplitude neural network and a sign structure, and focus on the optimization of the amplitude network while keeping the sign structure fixed. The amplitude network is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual blocks, namely a ResNet. Our method is tested on three typical quantum many-body systems. The obtained ground state energies are lower than or comparable to those from traditional variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Surprisingly, for the frustrated Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model, our results are better than those of the complex-valued CNN in the literature, implying that the sign structure of the complex-valued NQS is difficult to be optimized. We will study the optimization of the sign structure of NQSs in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computed Green's Functions using a Cumulant Expansion of the Lanczos Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantum computational method to calculate the many-body Green's function matrix in a spin orbital basis. We apply our approach to finite-sized fermionic Hubbard models and related impurity models within Dynamical Mean Field Theory, and demonstrate the calculation of Green's functions on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. Our approach involves a cumulant expansion of the Lanczos method, using Hamiltonian moments as measurable expectation values. This bypasses the need for a large overhead in the number of measurements due to repeated applications of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and instead measures the expectation value of the moments with one set of measurement circuits. From the measured moments, the tridiagonalised Hamiltonian matrix can be computed, which in turn yields the Green's function via continued fractions. While we use a variational algorithm to prepare the ground state in this work, we note that the modularity of our implementation allows for other (non-variational) approaches to be used for the ground state.</description>

      <title>Kondo breakdown in multi-orbital Anderson lattices induced by destructive hybridization interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a multi band extension to the periodic Anderson model. We use a single site DMFT(NRG) in order to study the impact of the conduction band mediated effective hopping of the correlated electrons between the correlated orbitals onto the heavy Fermi liquid formation. Whereas the hybridization of a single impurity model with two distinct conduction bands always adds up constructively, $T_{K}\propto \exp(-\mathrm{const}\, U/(\Gamma_1+\Gamma_2))$, we show that this does not have to be the case in lattice models, where, in remarkable contrast, also an low-energy Fermi liquid scale $T_0\propto \exp(-\mathrm{const}\, U/(\Gamma_1-\Gamma_2))$ can emerge due to quantum interference effects in multi band models, where $U$ denotes the local Coulomb matrix element of the correlated orbitals and $\Gamma_i$ the local hybridization strength of band $i$. At high symmetry points, heavy Fermi liquid formation is suppressed which is associated with a breakdown of the Kondo effect. This results in an asymptotically scale-invariant (i.e., power-law) spectrum of the correlated orbitals $\propto|\omega|^{1/3}$, indicating non-Fermi liquid properties of the quantum critical point, and a small Fermi surface including only the light quasi-particles. This orbital selective Mott phase demonstrates the possibility of metallic local criticality within the general framework of ordinary single site DMFT.</description>

      <title>On dualities of paired quantum Hall bilayer states at $\nu_T = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density-balanced, widely separated quantum Hall bilayers at $\nu_T = 1$ can be described as two copies of composite Fermi liquids (CFLs). The two CFLs have interlayer weak-coupling BCS instabilities mediated by gauge fluctuations, the resulting pairing symmetry of which depends on the CFL hypothesis used. If both layers are described by the conventional Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory-based composite electron liquid (CEL), the dominant pairing instability is in the $p+ip$ channel; whereas if one layer is described by CEL and the other by a composite hole liquid (CHL, in the sense of anti-HLR), the dominant pairing instability occurs in the $s$-wave channel. Using the Dirac composite fermion (CF) picture, we show that these two pairing channels can be mapped onto each other by particle-hole (PH) transformation. Furthermore, we derive the CHL theory as the non-relativistic limit of the PH-transformed massive Dirac CF theory. Finally, we prove that an effective topological field theory for the paired CEL-CHL in the weak-coupling limit is equivalent to the exciton condensate phase in the strong-coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum criticality through the lens of topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the topological holographic framework to characterize and gain insights into the nature of quantum critical points and gapless phases in fermionic quantum systems. Topological holography is a general framework that describes the generalized global symmetry and the symmetry charges of a local quantum system in terms of a slab of a topological order, termed as the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), in one higher dimension. In this work, we consider a generalization of the topological holographic picture for $(1+1)d$ fermionic quantum phases of matter. We discuss how spin structures are encoded in the SymTFT and establish the connection between the formal fermionization formula in quantum field theory and the choice of fermionic gapped boundary conditions of the SymTFT. We demonstrate the identification and the characterization of the fermionic gapped phases and phase transitions through detailed analysis of various examples, including the fermionic systems with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{F}$, and the fermionic version of the non-invertible $\text{Rep}(S_{3})$ symmetry. Our work uncovers many exotic fermionic quantum critical points and gapless phases, including two kinds of fermionic symmetry enriched quantum critical points, a fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, and a fermionic gapless spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase that breaks the fermionic non-invertible symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we examine the unoccupied electronic structure and electron dynamics of the type-I Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$. Using the ability to change the probe photon energy over a wide range, we identify the predicted Weyl points in the unoccupied three-dimensional band structure and we discuss the effect of $k_\perp$ broadening in the normally unoccupied states. We characterise the electron dynamics close to the Weyl point and in other parts of three-dimensional Brillouin zone using $k$-means, an unsupervised machine learning technique. This reveals distinct differences -- in particular, dynamics that are faster in the parts of the Brillouin zone that host most of the bulk Fermi surface than in parts close to the Weyl points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electron dynamics in the unoccupied states of the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ is studied by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). The measurement's result is the photoemission intensity $I$ as a function of at least four parameters: the emission angle and kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, the time delay between pump and probe laser pulses, and the probe laser photon energy that needs to be varied to access the full three-dimensional Brillouin zone of the material. The TR-ARPES results are reported in an accompanying paper. Here we focus on the technique of using $k$-means, an unsupervised machine learning technique, in order to discover trends in the four-dimensional data sets. We study how to compare the electron dynamics across the entire data set and how to reveal subtle variations between different data sets collected in the vicinity of the bulk Weyl points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of the intrinsic metric profoundly influence the neutral excitations in the fractional quantum Hall system, as established by Haldane in 2011 \cite{Haldane2011}, and further evidenced by a recent two-photon experiment \cite{Liang2024}. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic properties of these excitations, especially at long wavelengths, continues to elude interest. In this study, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate the neutral excitations of the Laughlin and Moore-Read states on an infinite cylinder. This investigation deepens our understanding of the excitation spectrum in regions where traditional methods do not work effectively. The spectral functions for both states reveal the presence of $S=-2$ geometric excitations. For the first time, we unveil the complex spectra of both neutral fermion and bosonic Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman modes within the excitation continuum by calculating the three-particle density response function for the Moore-Read state. Our findings support the hypothesis of emergent supersymmetry and highlight the potential for detecting neutral fermions in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Highly correlated two-dimensional electron fluid in best-quality GaAs quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.01035v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetotransport phenomena in high-quality quantum wells often shed a light on the nature of microscopic states of two-dimensional electrons in these systems. In particular, the independence of photoresistance on the polarization helicity of incident radiation have been treated an important puzzling result, which had no well-established explanation up to now. Here we propose a theoretical model of dynamics of a strongly non-ideal two-dimensional electron liquid in moderate magnetic fields. In this system, in particular, successive collisions of electrons joined in pairs are as important as single collisions of statistically independent electrons. The resulting fluid photoresistance exhibits an irregular shape of magnetooscillations, the absence of the dependence on the helicity of the circular polarization of incident radiation, and a large peak near the doubled cyclotron frequency. All these effects were observed in experiments on best-quality GaAs quantum wells. We conclude that 2D electrons in such nanostructures in moderate magnetic fields form a novel type of highly correlated fluids.</description>

      <title>Is spontaneous vortex generation in superconducting 4Hb-TaS$_2$ from vison-vortex nucleation with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the superconducting van der Waals material 4Hb-TaS$_2$ to realize the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order and interpret the recent discovery of the spontaneous vortex generation in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ as the vison-vortex nucleation. For the alternating stacking of metallic/superconducting and Mott insulating layers in 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we expect the local moments in the Mott insulating 1T-TaS$_2$ layer to form the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. The spontaneous vortex generation in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is interpreted from the transition or nucleation between the superconducting vortex and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vison in different phase regimes. Differing from the single vison-vortex nucleation in the original Senthil-Fisher's cuprate proposal, we consider such nucleation process between the superconducting vortex lattice and the vison crystal. We further propose experiments to distinguish this proposal with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order from the chiral spin liquid scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice may provide a robust topological quantum memory platform, but finding a material that realizes the unique spin liquid phase remains a considerable challenge. We demonstrate that an effective Kitaev Hamiltonian can arise from a half-filled Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian where each site can experience a magnetic field in a different direction. As such, we provide a method for realizing the Kitaev spin liquid on a single hexagonal plaquette made up of twelve quantum dots. Despite the small system size, there are clear signatures of the Kitaev spin-liquid ground state, and there is a range of parameters where these signatures are predicted, allowing a potential platform where Kitaev spin-liquid physics can be explored experimentally in quantum dot plaquettes.</description>

      <title>The $g$-function and Defect Changing Operators from Wavefunction Overlap on a Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects are common in physical systems with boundaries, impurities or extensive measurements. The interaction between bulk and defect can lead to rich physical phenomena. Defects in gapless phases of matter with conformal symmetry usually flow to a defect conformal field theory (dCFT). Understanding the universal properties of dCFTs is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computational strategy applicable to a line defect in arbitrary dimensions. Our main assumption is that the defect has a UV description in terms of a local modification of the Hamiltonian so that we can compute the overlap between low-energy eigenstates of a system with or without the defect insertion. We argue that these overlaps contain a wealth of conformal data, including the $g$-function, which is an RG monotonic quantity that distinguishes different dCFTs, the scaling dimensions of defect creation operators $\Delta^{+0}_\alpha$ and changing operators $\Delta^{+-}_\alpha$ that live on the intersection of different types of line defects, and various OPE coefficients. We apply this method to the fuzzy sphere regularization of 3D CFTs and study the magnetic line defect of the 3D Ising CFT. Using exact diagonalization and DMRG, we report the non-perturbative results $g=0.602(2),\Delta^{+0}_0=0.108(5)$ and $\Delta^{+-}_0=0.84(5)$ for the first time. We also obtain other OPE coefficients and scaling dimensions. Our results have significant physical implications. For example, they constrain the possible occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking at line defects of the 3D Ising CFT. Our method can be potentially applied to various other dCFTs, such as plane defects and Wilson lines in gauge theories.</description>
