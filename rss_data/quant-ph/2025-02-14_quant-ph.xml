      <title>Rapid-stable Collective Charging and Reverse Suppressing in Many-Body Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two major challenges in the process of practical development of quantum batteries (QBs) are: how to achieve rapid-stable charging, i.e., the maximum extractable work quantified via ergotropy, and how to identify the reverse mechanism of rapid-stable charging and propose contrary control strategies in many-body quantum systems. This work proposes a strongly coupled many-body collective charging QB scheme interacting with the surrounding environment, analyzes its physical operating mechanisms as a battery system, explores the mechanisms for achieving fast and stable collective charging under strong environmental coupling, and provides a detailed analysis of various physical methods for suppressing the reverse mechanism. This work highlights the novel properties of many-body QB systems and advances the physical research needed to accelerate the practical application of QBs.</description>

      <title>Complement Sampling: Provable, Verifiable and NISQable Quantum Advantage in Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a fixed universe of $N=2^n$ elements and the uniform distribution over elements of some subset of size $K$. Given samples from this distribution, the task of complement sampling is to provide a sample from the complementary subset. We give a simple quantum algorithm that uses only a single quantum sample -- a single copy of the uniform superposition over elements of the subset. When $K=N/2$, we show that the quantum algorithm succeeds with probability $1$, whereas classically $\Theta(N)$ samples are required to succeed with bounded probability of error. This shows that in a sample-to-sample setting, quantum computation can achieve the largest possible separation over classical computation. Moreover, we show that the same bound can be lifted to prove average-case hardness. It follows that under the assumption of the existence of one-way functions, complement sampling gives provable, verifiable and NISQable quantum advantage in a sample complexity setting.</description>

      <title>CV4Quantum: Reducing the Sampling Overhead in Probabilistic Error Cancellation Using Control Variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiprobabilistic decompositions (QPDs) play a key role in maximizing the utility of near-term quantum hardware. For example, Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) (an error mitigation technique) and circuit cutting (which enables large quantum computations to be performed on quantum hardware with a limited number of qubits) both involve QPDs. Computations based on QPDs typically incur large sampling overheads that grow exponentially, e.g., with the number of error-terms mitigated or the number of circuit-cuts employed, limiting their practical feasibility. In this work, we adapt the control variates variance reduction technique from the statistics literature in order to reduce the sampling overhead in QPD-based computations. We demonstrate our method, dubbed CV4Quantum, using simulation experiments that mimic a realistic PEC scenario. In more than 50% of the PEC-based estimations performed in the study, we observed a more than 50% reduction in the number of samples needed to achieve a given precision when using our technique. We discuss how future research on constructing good control variates can lead to even stronger sampling overhead reduction.</description>

      <title>Quantum communication over bandwidth-and-time-limited channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard communication systems have transmission spectra that characterize their ability to perform frequency multiplexing over a finite bandwidth. Realistic quantum signals in quantum communication systems like transducers are inherently limited in time due to intrinsic decoherence and finite latency, which hinders the direct implementation of frequency-multiplexed encoding. We investigate quantum channel capacities for bandwidth-and-time-limited (BTL) channels to establish the optimal communication strategy in a realistic setting. For pure-loss bosonic channels, we derive analytical solutions of the optimal encoding and decoding modes for Lorentzian and box transmission spectra, along with numerical solutions for various other transmissions. Our findings reveal a general feature of sequential activation of quantum channels as the input signal duration increases, as well as the existence of optimal signal length for scenarios where only a limited number of channels are in use.</description>

      <title>Assessing Quantum Layout Synthesis Tools via Known Optimal-SWAP Cost Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum layout synthesis (QLS) is a critical step in quantum program compilation for superconducting quantum computers, involving the insertion of SWAP gates to satisfy hardware connectivity constraints. While previous works have introduced SWAP-free benchmarks with known-optimal depths for evaluating QLS tools, these benchmarks overlook SWAP count - a key performance metric. Real-world applications often require SWAP gates, making SWAP-free benchmarks insufficient for fully assessing QLS tool performance. To address this limitation, we introduce QUBIKOS, a benchmark set with provable-optimal SWAP counts and non-trivial circuit structures. For the first time, we are able to quantify the optimality gaps of SWAP gate usages of the leading QLS algorithms, which are surprisingly large: LightSabre from IBM delivers the best performance with an optimality gap of 63x, followed by ML-QLS with an optimality gap of 117x. Similarly, QMAP and t|ket&gt; exhibit significantly larger gaps of 250x and 330x, respectively. This highlights the need for further advancements in QLS methodologies. Beyond evaluation, QUBIKOS offers valuable insights for guiding the development of future QLS tools, as demonstrated through an analysis of a suboptimal case in LightSABRE. This underscores QUBIKOS's utility as both an evaluation framework and a tool for advancing QLS research.</description>

      <title>A quantum speedup algorithm for TSP based on quantum dynamic programming with very few qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP-hard problem that plays a crucial role in combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we are interested in the quantum search framework for the TSP because it has robust theoretical guarantees. However, we need to first search for all Hamiltonian cycles from a very large solution space, which greatly weakens the advantage of quantum search algorithms. To address this issue, one can first prepare a superposition state of all feasible solutions, and then amplify the amplitude of the optimal solution from it. We propose a quantum algorithm to generate the uniform superposition state of all N-length Hamiltonian cycles as an initial state within polynomial gate complexity based on pure quantum dynamic programming with very few ancillary qubits, which achieves exponential acceleration compared to the previous initial state preparation algorithm. As a result, we realized the theoretical minimum query complexity of quantum search algorithms for a general TSP. Compared to some algorithms that theoretically have lower query complexities but lack practical implementation solutions, our algorithm has feasible circuit implementation.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Si spin qubit arrays with multilevel interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promise of quantum computation is contingent upon physical qubits with both low gate error rate and broad scalability. Silicon-based spins are a leading qubit platform, but demonstrations to date have not utilized fabrication processes capable of extending arrays in two dimensions while maintaining complete control of individual spins. Here, we implement an interconnect process, common in semiconductor manufacturing, with multiple back-end-of-line layers to show an extendable two-dimensional array of spins with fully controllable nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. In a device using three interconnect layers, we encode exchange-only qubits and achieve average single-qubit gate fidelities consistent with single-layer devices, including fidelities greater than 99.9%, as measured by blind randomized benchmarking. Moreover, with spin connectivity in two dimensions, we show that both linear and right-angle exchange-only qubits with high performance can be formed, enabling qubit array reconfigurability in the presence of defects. This extendable device platform demonstrates that industrial manufacturing techniques can be leveraged for scalable spin qubit technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement in qudit states offers a promising pathway towards the realization of practical, large-scale quantum systems that are highly controllable. These systems can be leveraged for various applications, including advanced quantum information processing, secure communications, computation, and metrology. In this context, quantum frequency combs have a crucial role as they inherently support multiple modes in both temporal and frequency domains, while preserving a single spatial mode. The multiple temporal and frequency modes of quantum frequency combs facilitate the generation, characterization, and control of high-dimensional time-frequency entanglement in extensive quantum systems. In this review article, we provide an overview of recent technological advancements in high-dimensional energy-time entangled quantum frequency combs. We explore how these time-frequency qudits, achieved using scalable telecommunications-wavelength components, can empower the creation of large-scale quantum states. Advances in quantum frequency combs can unlock new capabilities and versatility for promising developments in quantum science and technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Trojan Insertion: Controlled Activation for Covert Circuit Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has demonstrated superior efficiency compared to classical computing. Quantum circuits are essential for implementing functions and achieving correct computational outcomes. Quantum circuit compilers, which translate high-level quantum operations into hardware-specific gates while optimizing performance, serve as the interface between the quantum software stack and physical quantum machines. However, untrusted compilers can introduce malicious hardware Trojans into quantum circuits, altering their functionality and leading to incorrect results. In the world of classical computing, effective hardware Trojans are a critical threat to integrated circuits. This process often involves stealthily inserting conditional logic gates that activate under specific input conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel advanced quantum Trojan that is controllable, allowing it to be activated or deactivated under different circumstances. These Trojans remain dormant until triggered by predefined input conditions, making detection challenging. Through a series of benchmark experiments, we demonstrate the feasibility of this method by evaluating the effectiveness of embedding controlled trojans in quantum circuits and measuring their impact on circuit performance and security.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Four Photon Subtraction from Squeezed Vacuum: Preparing Cat State for Optical Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating logical qubits, essential for error detection and correction in quantum computation, remains a critical challenge in continuous-variable (CV) optical quantum information processing. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is a leading candidate for logical qubits, and its generation requires large-amplitude coherent state superpositions -- Schr\"{o}dinger cat states. However, experimentally producing these resource states has been hindered in the optical domain by technical challenges. The photon subtraction method, a standard approach for generating cat states using a squeezed vacuum and a photon number-resolving detector, has proven difficult to scale to multi-photon operations. While the amplitude of the generated cat states increases with the number of subtracted photons, limitations in the generation rate have restricted the maximum photon subtraction to $n=3$ for over a decade. In this work, we demonstrate high-rate photon subtraction of up to four photons from a squeezed vacuum with picosecond wavepackets generated by a broadband optical parametric amplifier. Using a Ti-Au superconducting-transition-edge sensor, we achieve high-speed, high-resolution photon number discrimination. The resulting states exhibit Wigner function negativity without loss correction, and their quantum coherence is verified through off-diagonal density matrix elements in CV representation. These results overcome long-standing limitations in multi-photon operations, providing a critical foundation for generating quantum resources essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing and advancing ultrafast optical quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit for Non-Unitary Linear Transformation of Basis Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to implementing non-unitary linear transformations of basis on quantum computational platforms, a significant leap beyond the conventional unitary methods. By integrating Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) into the process, the method achieves an operational depth of $O(n)$ with about $n$ ancilla qubits, enhancing the computational capabilities for analyzing fermionic systems. The non-unitarity of the transformation allows us to transform a wave function from one basis to another, which can span different spaces. By this trick, we can calculate the overlap of two wavefunctions that live in different (but non-distinct Hilbert subspaces) with different basis representations. This provides the opportunity to use state specific ansatzes to calculate different energy eigenstates under orbital-optimized settings and may improve the accuracy when computing the energies of multiple eigenstates simultaneously in VQE or other framework. It allows for a deeper exploration of complex quantum states and phenomena, expanding the practical applications of quantum computing in physics and chemistry.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of Multipath Entanglement Purification in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum networks, a set of entangled states distributed over multiple, alternative, distinct paths between a pair of source-destination nodes can be purified to obtain a higher fidelity entangled state between the nodes. This multipath entanglement purification (MP-EP) strategy can exploit the network's complex structure to strengthen the entanglement connection between node pairs separated by appropriate graph distances. We investigate the network scenarios in which MP-EP outperforms entanglement distribution over single network paths utilising a statistical model of a quantum network and find that MP-EP can be an effective entanglement distribution strategy over a range of node separations determined by the average edge fidelities and probabilities of the network. We find that MP-EP can bost the entanglement connection between suitably separated node pairs to reach fidelities sufficient for a given quantum task thereby increasing the functionality of a quantum network. Further, we provide statistical criteria in terms of network parameters that can determine the regions of the network where MP-EP can be a useful entanglement distribution strategy.</description>

      <title>Generalized Cross-Entropy Benchmarking for Random Circuits with Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-entropy benchmarking is a central technique used to certify a quantum chip in recent experiments. To better understand its mathematical foundation and develop new benchmarking schemes, we introduce the concept of ergodicity to random circuit sampling and find that the Haar random quantum circuit satisfies an ergodicity condition -- the average of certain types of post-processing function over the output bit strings is close to the average over the unitary ensemble. For noiseless random circuits, we prove that the ergodicity holds for polynomials of degree $t$ with positive coefficients and when the random circuits form a unitary $2t$-design. For strong enough noise, the ergodicity condition is violated. This suggests that ergodicity is a property that can be exploited to certify a quantum chip. We formulate the deviation of ergodicity as a measure for quantum chip benchmarking and show that it can be used to estimate the circuit fidelity for global depolarizing noise and weakly correlated noise. For a quadratic post-processing function, our framework recovers Google's result on estimating the circuit fidelity via linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB), and we give a sufficient condition on the noise model characterizing when such estimation is valid. Our results establish an interesting connection between ergodicity and noise in random circuits and provide new insights into designing quantum benchmarking schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum code division multiple access based continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quantum code division multiple access (q-CDMA) based continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system. In the proposed system, the quantum states of two senders ($\text{Alice}_{1,2}$) are chaotically encoded through chaotic phase shifters and then transmitted over a quantum channel. At the receiver, the quantum states are decoded via chaos synchronization to separate the quantum states sent by the different senders and received by the two receivers ($\text{Bob}_{1,2}$) separately. We characterize the input-output relation of the quadrature between the two senders and receivers and then analyze the secret key rate (SKR) of the q-CDMA-based CV-QKD system. Our numerical results reveal that the q-CDMA approach can significantly enhance the SKR for both users when compared to the single-user case without the q-CDMA approach.</description>

      <title>Scalable Optical Quantum State Synthesizer with Dual-Mode Cavity Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing with light is a promising approach to achieving large-scale quantum computation. While Gaussian operations on optical states have been successfully scaled, the generation of highly non-Gaussian states remains a critical challenge for achieving universality and fault-tolerance. However, due to the inherently weak nonlinearity in optics, creating non-Gaussian states remains challenging. A promising solution is to ``breed'' non-Gaussianity by combining multiple weakly non-Gaussian states using quantum memory systems.
  Here, we propose and demonstrate a scalable method for generating optical non-Gaussian states using a cavity-based quantum memory operating in continuous time. Our memory features dual-mode operation, enabling efficient switching between memory and entangling functionalities, allowing state generation and processing with minimal resources. By employing a time-domain-multiplexed breeding protocol, we successfully generated Wigner-negative states, a key requirement for quantum error correction. This work also marks the first full demonstration of continuous-time cavity-based quantum memory, encompassing the complete processes of writing, storage, and readout.
  These results represent a significant advancement in quantum information processing with light, providing a scalable method for generating complex non-Gaussian states essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Beyond advancing optical quantum computing, the techniques and insights from this work could impact a wide range of applications, from enhancing quantum communication networks to refining quantum sensing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Frequency Conversion of Ultra-Violet Single Photons from a Trapped Ytterbium Ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion trap system is a leading candidate for quantum network privileged by its long coherence time, high-fidelity gate operations, and the ion-photon entanglement that generates an ideal pair of a stationary memory qubit and a flying communication qubit. Rapid developments in nonlinear quantum frequency conversion techniques have enhanced the potential for constructing a trapped ion quantum network via optical fiber connections. The generation of long-distance entanglement has been demonstrated with ions such as Ca$^{+}$ and Ba$^{+}$, which emit photons in visible or near-infrared range naturally. On the other hand, as the qubit-native photons reside in ultra-violet (UV) spectrum, the Yb$^{+}$ ion has not been considered as a strong competitor for telecommunication qubits despite extensive research on it. Here, we demonstrate an efficient difference-frequency conversion of UV photons, emitted from a trapped Yb$^{+}$ ion, into a visible range. We provide experimental evidence that confirms the converted photons are radiated from the Yb$^{+}$ ion. Our results provide a crucial step toward realizing a long-distance trapped ion quantum network based on Yb$^{+}$ ions through quantum frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limit and Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation under Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum feedback control is a technique for controlling quantum dynamics by applying control inputs to the quantum system based on the results of measurements performed on the system. It is an important technique from both an applied and a fundamental theoretical point of view. There are two fundamental inequalities that describe trade-off relations in quantum mechanics, namely, the quantum speed limit and the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. They characterize the operational limit of non-equilibrium quantum systems, making them essential for controlling such systems. Therefore, it is meaningful to formulate these trade-off relations within the framework of quantum feedback control. In this paper, we derive these inequalities based on the continuous matrix product state method. Additionally, we analytically derive the exact form of quantum dynamical activity under feedback control, which serves as the cost term in these inequalities. Specifically, we focus on the cases of Markovian feedback, i.e., the direct feedback of continuous measurement results. Our numerical analysis reveals that the presence of feedback control can improve the quantum speed limit time and the quality of continuous measurements. Thus, our work clarifies how feedback control affects these important trade-off relationships in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Point-Gap Interactions Unveil the Mirage Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topology has revolutionized our understanding of energy gaps and band topology, unveiling phases that do not exist within the Hermitian framework. Nonetheless, its fundamental implications for quantum interactions in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a novel interaction mechanism by examining a quantum-optical system where quantum emitters interact through the photonic band-gap of a dissipative photon bath with periodic boundaries, described by a nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Although localized photons within the gap should inhibit interactions between emitters in certain regimes, we find that long-range interactions emerge, defying conventional expectations. These anomalous interactions are mediated by a ``mirage bath" - a virtual bath that unfolds onto a distinct layer of the Riemann surface. This mirage bath generates emitter dynamics identical to those produced by the physical bath but possesses distinct band topology. Crucially, the interactions inherit the topology of the mirage bath, not the physical one. This bath duality is inherent to any dissipative bath with spectral topology, leading to a fundamentally new mechanism for long-range interactions and correlations across the multi-layered Riemann surface, unseen in traditional settings. Our findings open new avenues in quantum optics, many-body quantum simulations, and offer fresh insights into non-Hermitian topology.</description>

      <title>Two-level control over quantum state creation via entangled equal-probability state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the scheme realizing the two-level control over the unitary operators $U_k$ creating the required quantum state of the system $S$. These operators are controlled by the superposition state of the auxiliary subsystem $R$ which is governed by two control centers. The
  first-level control center (main control) creates the equal-probability pure state of $R$ with certain distribution of phase factors that, in turn, govern the power of the second-level control center $C$ that applies the special $V$-operators to the same subsystem $R$ changing its state and thus controlling the applicability of $U_k$. In addition, the above phases are responsible for the entanglement in the subsystem $R$. We find the direct relation between this entanglement and the number of operators $U_k$ that can be controlled by $C$. The simple example of a two-level control system governing the creation of entangled state of the two-qubit system $S$ is presented.</description>

      <title>Citizen Science Games on the Timeline of Quantum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of existing quantum physics-related games, referred to as \textit{quantum games}, that serve citizen science research in quantum physics. Additionally, we explore the connection between citizen science and \textit{quantum computer games}, games played on quantum computers. The information presented is derived from academic references and supplemented by diverse sources, including social media publications, conference presentations, and blog posts from research groups and developers associated with the presented games. We observe that the current landscape of quantum games is shaped by three distinct driving forces: the serious application of games, the evolution of quantum computers, and open game development events such as \textit{Quantum Game Jams}. Notably, citizen science plays an influential role in all three aspects. The article points to existing design guides for citizen science quantum games and views future prospects of citizen science projects and quantum games through collaborative endeavours, human-machine collaboration, and open access quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Approximate Dynamical Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a critical role in enabling fault-tolerant quantum computing by protecting fragile quantum information from noise. While general-purpose quantum error correction codes are designed to address a wide range of noise types, they often require substantial resources, making them impractical for near-term quantum devices. Approximate quantum error correction provides an alternative by tailoring codes to specific noise environments, reducing resource demands while maintaining effective error suppression. Dynamical codes, including Floquet codes, introduce a dynamic approach to quantum error correction, employing time-dependent operations to stabilize logical qubits. In this work, we combine the flexibility of dynamical codes with the efficiency of approximate quantum error correction to offer a promising avenue for addressing dominant noise in quantum systems. We construct several approximate dynamical codes using the recently developed strategic code framework. As a special case, we recover the approximate static codes widely studied in the existing literature. By analyzing these approximate dynamical codes through semidefinite programming, we establish the uniqueness and robustness of the optimal encoding, decoding, and check measurements. We also develop a temporal Petz recovery map suited to approximate dynamical codes.</description>

      <title>Composing Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composition is something we take for granted in classical algorithms design, and in particular, we take it as a basic axiom that composing ``efficient'' algorithms should result in an ``efficient'' algorithm -- even using this intuition to justify our definition of ``efficient.'' Composing quantum algorithms is a much more subtle affair than composing classical algorithms. It has long been known that zero-error quantum algorithms \emph{do not} compose, but it turns out that, using the right algorithmic lens, bounded-error quantum algorithms do. In fact, in the bounded-error setting, quantum algorithms can even avoid the log factor needed in composing bounded-error randomized algorithms that comes from amplifying the success probability via majority voting. In this article, aimed at a general computer science audience, we try to give some intuition for these results: why composing quantum algorithms is tricky, particularly in the zero-error setting, but why it nonetheless works \emph{better} than classical composition in the bounded-error setting.</description>

      <title>Space-Efficient Quantum Error Reduction without log Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an algorithm that outputs the correct answer with bounded error, say $1/3$, it is sometimes desirable to reduce this error to some arbitrarily small $\varepsilon$ -- for example, if one wants to call the algorithm many times as a subroutine. The usual method, for both quantum and randomized algorithms, is a procedure called majority voting, which incurs a multiplicative overhead of $O(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ from calling the algorithm this many times.
  A recent paper introduced a model of quantum computation called \emph{transducers}, and showed how to reduce the ``error'' of a transducer arbitrarily with only constant overhead, using a construction analogous to majority voting called \emph{purification}. Even error-free transducers map to bounded-error quantum algorithms, so this does not let you reduce algorithmic error for free, but it does allow bounded-error quantum algorithms to be composed without incurring log factors.
  In this paper, we present a new highly simplified construction of a purifier, that can be understood as a weighted walk on a line similar to a random walk interpretation of majority voting. In addition to providing a new perspective that is easier to contrast with majority voting, our purifier has exponentially better space complexity than the previous one, and quadratically better dependence on the soundness-completeness gap of the algorithm being purified. Our new purifier has nearly optimal query complexity, even down to the constant, which matters when one composes quantum algorithms to super-constant depth.</description>

      <title>Low-Fidelity Entanglement Distillation with FIMAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncontrolled interactions with the environment introduce errors that remain a significant challenge to the reliability of quantum technologies using entanglement. An essential method to overcome or mitigate these errors is entanglement distillation, the transformation of multiple copies of weakly entangled states into a smaller number of approximately maximally entangled states. We present a comparative analysis of the stabilizer-based two-copy entanglement distillation protocol, FIMAX, against other recurrent two-copy protocols, including ADGJ, DEJMPS, P1-P2, and the generalized BBPSSW protocol. We focus on low-fidelity bipartite quantum states in dimensions $d = 2$ and $d = 3$, which are particularly challenging to distill. Our findings demonstrate that FIMAX exhibits superior performance for these states. While other protocols struggle with highly noisy states, FIMAX successfully distills entanglement even when the initial state quality is severely compromised. These results highlight the protocol's capability to address the effects of environmental noise, advancing the robustness and scalability of quantum technologies leveraging entanglement distillation.</description>

      <title>One-shot manipulation of coherence in dynamic quantum resource theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum information is to understand the operational significance of quantum resources. Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a powerful theoretical framework that aids in analyzing and comprehending the operational meaning of these resources. Early resource theories primarily focused on analyzing static quantum resources. Recently, there has been growing interest in the study of dynamic quantum resources. In this paper, we utilize superchannel theory to describe the dynamic resource theory of quantum coherence. In this dynamic resource theory, we treat classical channels as free channels and consider two classes of free superchannels that preserve channel incoherence (maximally incoherent superchannels (MISC) and dephasing-covariant incoherent superchannels (DISC)) as free resources. We regard the quantum Fourier transform as the golden unit of dynamic coherence resources. We first establish the one-shot theory of dynamic coherence cost and dynamic coherence distillation, which involves converting the quantum Fourier transform into an arbitrary quantum channel using MISC and DISC. Next, we introduce a class of free superchannels known as $\delta$-MISC, which asymptotically generate negligible dynamic coherence. Finally, we provide upper and lower bounds for the one-shot catalytic dynamic coherence cost of quantum channels under the action of these $\delta$-MISC superchannels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By evidencing the holonomic and dynamical contributions in scattering problems, we develop a method for calculating the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. To validate our approach, we investigate the spin-resolved scattering of electrons along a wire subjected to a spatially varying magnetic (Zeeman) field. In particular, we show that in the high-energy limit, the transmission matrix aligns with the holonomy, reducing to a pure topological form. We illustrate the method by examining several scenarios with varied in-plane magnetic field profiles. For instance, our results indicate the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, with implications for use in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Entanglement behavior and localization properties in monitored fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry with stroboscopic projective measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Casimir effect in a (1+1)-dimensional model with a critical mode. Such a mode gives rise to a condensate described by the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In the condensate, there are two sources of the Casimir force; one is the conventional one resulting from the fluctuations, the other follows from the condensate. We consider three simple models that allow for condensate solutions in terms of elliptic Jacobi functions. We also investigate a method for obtaining approximate solutions and show its range of applicability. In all three examples we compute the condensate energy. In one example with a finite interval with Robin boundary conditions on one side and Dirichlet conditions on the other side, we calculate the vacuum energy and the Casimir force. There is a competition between the forces from the condensate and the fluctuations. We mention that the force from the condensate is always repulsive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of delta-kick collimation (DKC) applied to heteronuclear Feshbach molecules, focusing on both condensed and thermal ensembles across various interaction and temperature regimes. We demonstrate that DKC enables significant reductions in molecular cloud expansion energies and beam divergence, achieving expansion energies in the picokelvin range, comparable to state-of-the-art results obtained experimentally with atoms. Furthermore, we show that vibrational and translational motions remain strongly decoupled throughout the process, ensuring molecular stability during the delta-kick. This work paves the way for advanced experimental sequences involving degenerate ground state molecules, light-pulse molecular interferometry, and applications of dual-species precision measurements, such as testing the universality of free fall.</description>

      <title>Constant Overhead Entanglement Distillation via Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum entanglement enables key quantum networking capabilities such as secure communication and distributed quantum computing, but distributing entangled states through optical fibers is limited by noise and loss. Entanglement distillation protocols address this problem by extracting high-fidelity Bell pairs from multiple noisy ones. The primary objective is minimizing the resource overhead: the number of noisy input pairs needed to distill each high-fidelity output pair. While protocols achieving optimal overhead are known in theory, they often require complex decoding operations that make practical implementation challenging. We circumvent this challenge by introducing protocols that use quantum scrambling - the spreading of quantum information under chaotic dynamics - through random Clifford operations. Based on this scrambling mechanism, we design a distillation protocol that maintains asymptotically constant overhead, independent of the desired output error rate $\bar{\varepsilon}$, and can be implemented with shallow quantum circuits of depth $O(\operatorname{poly} \log \log \bar{\varepsilon}^{-1})$ and memory $O(\operatorname{poly} \log \bar{\varepsilon}^{-1})$. We show this protocol remains effective even with noisy quantum gates, making it suitable for near-term devices. Furthermore, by incorporating partial error correction, our protocol achieves state-of-the-art performance: starting with pairs of 10% initial infidelity, we require only 7 noisy inputs per output pair to distill a single Bell pair with infidelity $\bar{\varepsilon}=10^{-12}$, substantially outperforming existing schemes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our protocols through applications to quantum repeater networks.</description>

      <title>Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States</title>

Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/nqs-models, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.</description>

      <title>Continuous Variable Quantum MacWilliams Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive bounds on general quantum error correcting codes against the displacement noise channel. The bounds limit the distances attainable by codes and also apply in an approximate setting. Our main result is a quantum analogue of the classical Cohn-Elkies bound on sphere packing densities attainable in Euclidean space. We further derive a quantum version of Levenshtein's sphere packing bound and argue that Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) codes based on the $E_8$ and Leech lattices achieve optimal distances. The main technical tool is a continuous variable version of the quantum MacWilliams identities, which we introduce. The identities relate a pair of weight distributions which can be obtained for any two trace-class operators. General properties of these weight distributions are discussed, along with several examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum Synchronizing Words: Resetting and Preparing Qutrit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronizing words in classical automata theory provide a mechanism to reset any state of a deterministic automaton to a specific target state via a carefully chosen finite sequence of transition rules. In this work, we extend the concept of synchronizing words to quantum information theory. Specifically, we show that with only two quantum channels, it is possible to bring an arbitrary qutrit state close to a designated target state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that following this reset, any pure real qutrit state can be closely approximated using the same two channels. These findings establish a quantum analogue of synchronizing words, highlighting their potential applications in constructing minimal sets of universal quantum gates capable of both resetting and preparing arbitrary states.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Architecture and Cost Function on Dissipative Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining machine learning and quantum computation is a potential path towards powerful applications on quantum devices. Regarding this, quantum neural networks are a prominent approach. In this work, we present a novel architecture for dissipative quantum neural networks (DQNNs) in which each building block can implement any quantum channel, thus introducing a clear notion of universality suitable for the quantum framework. To this end, we reformulate DQNNs using isometries instead of conventionally used unitaries, thereby reducing the number of parameters in these models. We furthermore derive a versatile one-to-one parametrization of isometries, allowing for an efficient implementation of the proposed structure. Focusing on the impact of different cost functions on the optimization process, we numerically investigate the trainability of extended DQNNs. This unveils significant training differences among the cost functions considered. Our findings facilitate both the theoretical understanding and the experimental implementability of quantum neural networks.</description>

      <title>Constant-Overhead Fault-Tolerant Bell-Pair Distillation using High-Rate Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fault-tolerant Bell-pair distillation scheme achieving constant overhead through high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. Our approach maintains a constant distillation rate equal to the code rate - as high as $1/3$ in our implementations - while requiring no additional overhead beyond the physical qubits of the code. Full circuit-level analysis demonstrates fault-tolerance for input Bell pair infidelities below a threshold $\sim 5\%$, readily achievable with near-term capabilities. Unlike previous proposals, our scheme keeps the output Bell pairs encoded in qLDPC codes at each node, eliminating decoding overhead and enabling direct use in distributed quantum applications through recent advances in qLDPC computation. These results establish qLDPC-based distillation as a practical route toward resource-efficient quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the photon statistics of a single-mode sub-Poissonian light propagating in the temperature-loss bosonic channel with fluctuating transmittance which can be regarded as a temperature-dependent model of turbulent atmosphere. By assuming that the variance of the transmittance can be expressed in terms of the fluctuation strength parameter we show that the photon statistics of the light remains sub-Poissonian provided the averaged transmittance exceeds its critical value. The critical transmittance is analytically computed as a function of the input states parameters, the temperature and the fluctuation strength. The results are applied to study special cases of the one-mode squeezed states and the odd optical Shr\"odinger cats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for quantum computing applications in chemistry and materials science, particularly in addressing the limitations of classical methods for complex systems. This study benchmarks the performance of the VQE for calculating ground-state energies of aluminum clusters (Al$^-$, Al$_2$, and Al$_3^-$) within a quantum-density functional theory (DFT) embedding framework, systematically varying key parameters -- (I) classical optimizers, (II) circuit types, (III) number of repetitions, (IV) simulator types, (V) basis sets, and (VI) noise models. Our findings demonstrate that certain optimizers achieve efficient and accurate convergence, while circuit choice and basis set selection significantly impact accuracy, with higher-level basis sets closely matching classical computation data from Numerical Python Solver (NumPy) and Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark DataBase (CCCBDB). To evaluate the workflow under realistic conditions, we employed IBM noise models to simulate the effects of hardware noise. The results showed close agreement with CCCBDB benchmarks, with percent errors consistently below 0.02 percent. The results establish VQE's capability for reliable energy estimations and highlight the importance of optimizing quantum-DFT parameters to balance computational cost and precision. This work paves the way for broader VQE benchmarking on diverse chemical systems, with plans to make results accessible on Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS) and develop a Python package to support the quantum chemistry and materials science communities in advancing quantum-enhanced discovery.</description>

      <title>Absorbing state transitions with discrete symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in interactive quantum dynamics has inspired the study of fundamentally out-of-equilibrium dynamical phase transitions of quantum and classical many-body systems. Motivated by these developments, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions to absorbing states in one-dimensional systems that can model certain quantum circuits. Specifically, we consider dynamics for which the absorbing states are not unique due to a discrete symmetry: Z2 for two-state models and S3 or Z3 for three-state models. Under time evolution, domain walls in these models perform random walks and coarsen under local feedback, which, if perfect, reduces their number over time, driving the system to an absorbing state in polynomial time. Imperfect feedback, however, introduces domain wall multiplication (branching), potentially leading to an active phase. For Z2-symmetric two-state models, starting from a single domain wall, we find distinct absorbing and active phases as in previous studies. Extending this analysis to local three-state models shows that any nonzero branching rate drives the system into the active phase. However, we demonstrate that incorporating nonlocal classical information into the feedback can stabilize the absorbing phase against branching. By tuning the level of nonlocality, we observe a transition from the active to the absorbing phase, which belongs to a new universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This essay is a two-step reflection on the question 'Which events (can be said to) occur in quantum phenomena?' The first step regiments the ontological category of "statistical phenomena" and studies the adequacy of "probabilistic event models" as descriptions thereof. Guided by the conviction that quantum phenomena are to be circumscribed within this same ontological category, the second step highlights the peculiarities of probabilistic event models of some non-relativistic quantum phenomena, and thereby of what appear to be some plausible answers to our initial question. The reflection ends in an aporetic state, as it is by now usual in encounters between ontology and the quantum.</description>

      <title>Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantitive analytical treatment of two-point velocity correlations for two important classes of superfluid excitation in compressible quantum fluids: vortices, and rarefaction pulses. We achieve this using two approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for describing vortex cores in planar quantum fluids with improved analytic integrability that provides analytic results for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions, in good agreement with numerical results using the exact vortex shape. The results show signatures of short and long range correlations associated with vortex dipoles and vortex pairs respectively. Second, for the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton the asymptotic high velocity wavefunction provides analytical results for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the main length scale of the soliton. We compare our analytical treatment of the homogeneous system with numerical results for a trapped system, finding good quantitative agreement. Our results are relevant to experimental work to characterize quantum vortices and solitons in quantum fluids of atoms and light, and for studies of quantum turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Since the first experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensates in a spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice, a wide range of applications have been found in these systems. Here, we systematically study the ground-state phase diagram of the systems. We address that the band-edge phase in the ground-state phase diagram is exotic and exists in a very broad parameter regime. The superfluidity of the band-edge states is identified by elementary excitations and superfluid fraction.</description>

      <title>Broadband bright biphotons from periodically poled triple-resonance metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biphotons from spontaneous parametric down conversion with broad bandwidth are highly wanted in many quantum technologies. However, achieving broad bandwidth in both frequency and momentum while keeping a high rate remains a challenge for both conventional nonlinear crystals and recently emerging nonlinear metasurfaces. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a periodically poled triple-resonance metasurface (PPTM) incorporating a nano-grating atop a periodically poled LiNbO$_3$ thin film. PPTM supports high-Q guided mode resonances at pump, signal, and idler wavelengths meanwhile enabling quasi-phase matching between three guided modes in a broad frequency/momentum range. The predicted biphoton rate is over 100 MHz/mW with a frequency bandwidth of 165 nm around 1550 nm and a momentum bandwidth of $13^\circ \times 6^\circ$, improving the state-of-the-art by over three orders of magnitude in rate and one order of magnitude in bandwidths. This ultrathin broadband bright biphoton source could stimulate system-level miniaturization of various free-space quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model Induced by On-Site or Long-Range Two-Body Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the dissipative dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model induced by on-site or long-range two-body losses. We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses. We finally investigate the dissipative quench dynamics starting from a strongly-correlated superfluid state or from a Mott-insulating state; for the Bose-Hubbard chain initially confined in the superfluid-correlated regime, an unexpected strong decay of the density appearing at short times is revealed.</description>

      <title>Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective modes of an atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory. In particular we focus on the breathing mode of the soliton, which is not a single linearized normal mode but a common component of many modes, and therefore decays within a $t^{-1/2}$ envelope due to dispersion. If the soliton is held in the center of a harmonic trap, we show that the breathing amplitude revives periodically, as atoms shed from the vibrating soliton oscillate in the trap, and return. After each revival the breathing amplitude again decays, and this cycle repeats every trap half-period. The amplitude envelope of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, however, with a gradual increase in breathing followed by sudden drop in breathing amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum, and offer this coherent Bogoliubov-de Gennes phenomenon as a background against which to compare possible quantum many-body effects, including decoherence over trap-period time scales.</description>

With the Andreev bound state being confined to the nanoscale weak link, it couples to a circuit-QED architecture via the state-dependent supercurrent flowing through the weak link. Thus, increasing this coupling strength is a crucial challenge for this architecture. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and microwave characterization of an InAs nanowire weak link embedded in a superconducting loop with a lumped-element resonator patterned from a thin NbTiN film with high kinetic inductance. We investigated several devices with various weak link lengths and performed spectroscopy of spin-degenerate and spin-orbit split Andreev bound states for the shorter and longer weak links, respectively. Our approach offers a compact geometry and a large resonator impedance above 12 k$\Omega$ at a resonator frequency of 8 GHz, which results in a measured coupling strength reaching 1.95 GHz to the Andreev level and 77 MHz to the Andreev spin. Our spectroscopic data are in good agreement with existing theoretical models and demonstrate ultrastrong coupling to the Andreev pair qubit with the coupling strength approaching the bare resonator and qubit frequencies.</description>

Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling due to the cur- vature of the path. We then estimate the magnitude of this eff ective geometric spin-orbit interaction for structures that showcase chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We fi nd that this chiral-induced spin-orbit coupling (\chi-SOC), coupled to broken time-reversal symmetry, may provide a simple, yet rigorous way to describe the CISS phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Deterministic fabrication of GaAs-quantum-dot micropillar single-photon sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the performance of droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots (QDs) integrated into micropillar structures using a deterministic fabrication technique. We demonstrate a unity QD positioning yield across 74 devices and consistent device performance. Under p-shell excitation, the QD decay dynamics within the micropillars exhibit biexponential behavior, accompanied by intensity fluctuations limiting the source efficiency to &lt; 4.5%. Charge stabilization via low-power above-band LED excitation effectively reduces these fluctuations, doubling the source efficiency to $\sim$ 9%. Moreover, we introduce suppression of radiation modes by introducing cylindrical rings theoretically predicted to boost the collection efficiency by a factor of 4. Experimentally, only a modest improvement is obtained, underscoring the influence of even minor fabrication imperfections for this advanced design. Our findings demonstrate the reliability of our deterministic fabrication approach in producing high-yield, uniform devices, while offering detailed insights into the influence of charge noise and complex relaxation dynamics on the performance.</description>

      <title>Controlling Symmetries and Quantum Criticality in the Anisotropic Coupled-Top Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic coupled-top model, which describes the interactions between two large spins along both $x-$ and $y-$directions. By tuning anisotropic coupling strengths along distinct directions, we can manipulate the system's symmetry, inducing either discrete $Z_2$ or continuous U(1) symmetry. In the thermodynamic limit, the mean-field phase diagram is divided into five phases: the disordered paramagnetic phase, the ordered ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic phases with symmetry breaking along either $x-$ or $y-$direction. This results in a double degeneracy of the spin projections along the principal direction for $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. When U(1) symmetry is broken, infinite degeneracy associated with the Goldstone mode emerges. Beyond the mean-field ansatz, at the critical points, the energy gap closes, and both quantum fluctuations and entanglement entropy diverge, signaling the onset of second-order quantum phase transitions. These critical behaviors consistently support the universality class of $Z_2$ symmetry. Contrarily, when U(1) symmetry is broken, the energy gap vanishes beyond the critical points, yielding a novel exponent of 1, rather than 1/2 for $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. The framework provides an ideal platform for experimentally controlling symmetries and investigating associated physical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a mobile impurity in a one-dimensional harmonically confined optical lattice interacting repulsively with a bosonic bath. The behavior of the impurity across baths with superfluid and Mott-insulator domains is examined, including its full back-action effect on the bath. We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows a combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality catastrophe and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Superspin Renormalization and Slow Relaxation in Random Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Subroutine Composition</title>

Abstract: An important tool in algorithm design is the ability to build algorithms from other algorithms that run as subroutines. In the case of quantum algorithms, a subroutine may be called on a superposition of different inputs, which complicates things. For example, a classical algorithm that calls a subroutine $Q$ times, where the average probability of querying the subroutine on input $i$ is $p_i$, and the cost of the subroutine on input $i$ is $T_i$, incurs expected cost $Q\sum_i p_i E[T_i]$ from all subroutine queries. While this statement is obvious for classical algorithms, for quantum algorithms, it is much less so, since naively, if we run a quantum subroutine on a superposition of inputs, we need to wait for all branches of the superposition to terminate before we can apply the next operation. We nonetheless show an analogous quantum statement (*): If $q_i$ is the average query weight on $i$ over all queries, the cost from all quantum subroutine queries is $Q\sum_i q_i E[T_i]$. Here the query weight on $i$ for a particular query is the probability of measuring $i$ in the input register if we were to measure right before the query.
  We prove this result using the technique of multidimensional quantum walks, recently introduced in arXiv:2208.13492. We present a more general version of their quantum walk edge composition result, which yields variable-time quantum walks, generalizing variable-time quantum search, by, for example, replacing the update cost with $\sqrt{\sum_{u,v}\pi_u P_{u,v} E[T_{u,v}^2]}$, where $T_{u,v}$ is the cost to move from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$. The same technique that allows us to compose quantum subroutines in quantum walks can also be used to compose in any quantum algorithm, which is how we prove (*).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating many-body quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the large size of the state space. To address this issue, we propose using an SU(2) coherent state for individual spins to simulate spins on a lattice and derive equations of motion based on the variational principle. This method involves a sampling approach, where a subset of relevant configurations is chosen based on energy criteria, and a projection method is used to remove linear dependency on the overcomplete and time-dependent basis during propagation. We validate this method through numerical simulations of up to seven-qubit system, calculating key physical observables such as state probabilities and domain-wall densities. Our results indicate that while complete basis sets offer accurate dynamics, selected incomplete sets can recover essential features, especially with the assistance of a projector. The selected incomplete dual bases method is not limited by the structure of Hamiltonian and efficiently captures the non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The quantum world is described by a unit vector in the Hilbert space and the Hamiltonian. Do these abstract basis-independent objects give a complete description of the physical world, or should we include observables like positions and momenta and the decomposition into subsystems? According to "Hilbert-space fundamentalism" they give a complete description, and all other features of the physical world emerge from them (Carroll, arXiv:2103.09780). Here I will give a concrete refutation of this thesis based on the symmetries of the theory of quantum measurements. These results show that even if a tensor product structure is assumed along with the unit vector and the Hamiltonian, concrete physically distinct worlds can be described by the same structures.</description>

Abstract: Optical telescopes are powerful eyes for terrestrial and astronomical detection. Here we propose a new detection method with high efficiency, strong robustness and super precision, as an enhanced technique for optical telescopes in angular locating. In detail, our method requests only small number of incident single-photons, holds strong fault tolerance to any noise and improves the precision by magnitude orders comparing with current optical telescopes. Given these advantages, our method promises an important progress in remote sensing and astrometry, especially in locating the very dark object.</description>

Abstract: When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental limitation of quantum communication is that a single qubit can carry at most 1 bit of classical information. For an important class of quantum communication channels, known as entanglement-breaking, this limitation holds even if the sender and receiver share entangled particles. But does this mean that, for the purpose of communicating classical messages, a noisy entanglement-breaking qubit channel can be replaced by a noisy bit channel? Here we answer the question in the negative. We introduce a game, similar to the Monty Hall problem in classical statistics, where a sender assists a receiver in finding a valuable item (the prize) hidden into one of four possible boxes, while avoiding a hazardous item (the bomb) hidden in one of the remaining three boxes. We show that no classical strategy using a noisy bit channel can ensure that the bomb is avoided, even if the sender and receiver share arbitrary amounts of randomness. In contrast, communication of a qubit through a class of noisy entanglement-breaking channels, which we call quantum NOT channels, allows the players to deterministically avoid the bomb and to find the prize with a guaranteed nonzero probability. Our findings show that the communication of classical messages through a noisy entanglement-breaking qubit channel assisted by quantum entanglement cannot, in general, be simulated by communication through a noisy bit channel assisted by classical correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important quantities characterizing the microscopic properties of quantum systems are dynamical correlation functions. These correlations are obtained by time-evolving a perturbation of an eigenstate of the system, typically the ground state. In this work, we study approximations of these correlation functions that do not require time dynamics. We show that having access to a circuit that prepares an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, it is possible to approximate the dynamical correlation functions up to exponential accuracy in the complex frequency domain $\omega=\Re(\omega)+i\Im(\omega)$, on a strip above the real line $\Im(\omega)=0$. We achieve this by exploiting the continued fraction representation of the dynamical correlation functions as functions of frequency $\omega$, where the level $k$ approximant can be obtained by measuring a weight $O(k)$ operator on the eigenstate of interest. In the complex $\omega$ plane, we show how this approach allows to determine approximations to correlation functions with accuracy that increases exponentially with $k$.
  We analyse two algorithms to generate the continuous fraction representation in scalar or matrix form, starting from either one or many initial operators. We prove that these algorithms generate an exponentially accurate approximation of the dynamical correlation functions on a region sufficiently far away from the real frequency axis. We present numerical evidence of these theoretical results through simulations of small lattice systems. We comment on the stability of these algorithms with respect to sampling noise in the context of quantum simulation using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>On the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational quantum learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for successful variational quantum machine learning (QML) relies on the design of suitable parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), as analogues to neural networks in classical machine learning. Successful QML models must fulfill the properties of trainability and non-dequantization, among others. Recent works have highlighted an intricate interplay between trainability and dequantization of such models, which is still unresolved. In this work we contribute to this debate from the perspective of machine learning, proving a number of results identifying, among others when trainability and non-dequantization are not mutually exclusive. We begin by providing a number of new somewhat broader definitions of the relevant concepts, compared to what is found in other literature, which are operationally motivated, and consistent with prior art. With these precise definitions given and motivated, we then study the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational QML. Next, we also discuss the degrees of "variationalness" of QML models, where we distinguish between models like the hardware efficient ansatz and quantum kernel methods. Finally, we introduce recipes for building PQC-based QML models which are both trainable and nondequantizable, and corresponding to different degrees of variationalness. We do not address the practical utility for such models. Our work however does point toward a way forward for finding more general constructions, for which finding applications may become feasible.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical localization of discrete time evolution of topological split-step quantum random walk (QRW) on a single-site defect starting from a uniform distribution. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we determine the high localization probability regions in the parameter space of the quantum walker. These regions contain two or more pairs of trapped states, forming near a lattice defect. By investigating the spectral properties of the discrete-time evolution operators, we show that these trapped states have large overlap with the initial uniformly distributed state, thus offering a simple interpretation of the localization effect. As this localization scheme could be interpreted as a variation of spatial quantum search algorithm, we compare the localization probability and time with other types of two-dimensional quantum walks that do not have topological phases and realize localization time scaling similar to Grover's algorithm. Finally we show that mechanism of localization we identified is robust against the influence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Black Box Work Extraction and Composite Hypothesis Testing</title>

Abstract: Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory. We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

      <title>Tunable photon scattering by an atom dimer coupled to a band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters trapped near photonic crystal waveguides have recently emerged as an exciting platform for realizing novel quantum matter-light interfaces. Here we study tunable photon scattering in a photonic crystal waveguide coupled to an atom dimer with an arbitrary spatial separation. In the weak-excitation regime, we give the energy levels and their decay rates into the waveguide modes in the dressed basis, which both depend on the distance between the two atoms. We focus on the Bragg case and anti-Bragg case, where subradiant and superradiant states are produced and perfect transmission with a $\pi$ phase shift may occur on resonance. We observe quantum beats in the photon-photon correlation function of the reflected field in the anti-Bragg case. Moreover, the frequencies of quantum beats can be controlled due to the tunability of the bound states via the dispersion engineering of the structure. We also observe directional photon emission in the anti-Bragg case and give the dynamic mechanism of the perfect transmission. We quantify the effects of the system imperfections, including the deviation in the distance between the two atoms and the asymmetry in the atomic decay rates into the waveguide modes. With recent experimental advances in the superconducting microwave transmission lines, our results should soon be realizable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for verifying the local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph and stabilizer states. Our approach reduces the problem to solving a system of linear equations in modular arithmetic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any LU transformation between two graph states takes a specific form, naturally generalizing the class of local Clifford (LC) transformations. Lastly, using existing libraries, we verify that for up to $n=11$, the number of LU and LC orbits of stabilizer states is identical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that bipartite bound entangled states make possible violations of correlation inequalities in the prepare-and-measure scenario. These inequalities are satisfied by all classical models as well as by all quantum models that do not feature entanglement. In contrast to the known Bell inequality violations from bound entangled states, we find that the violations in the prepare-and-measure scenario are sizeable and significantly noise-tolerant. Furthermore, we show that significantly stronger quantum correlations are made possible by considering bound entanglement with a larger dimension.</description>

Abstract: Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.</description>

      <title>Entanglement teleportation along a regenerating hamster-wheel graph state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We scheme an efficient and reusable approach to quantum teleportation that allows cyclic teleportation of a two-qubit graph state around a quantum hamster wheel -- a ring of qubits entangled as a one-dimensional line prepared on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processor. The qubits on the ring are periodically measured and reused to achieve a teleportation depth that exceeds the total number of available qubits in the quantum processor. Using the outcomes measured during teleportation, we calculate and apply byproduct operators through dynamic circuits to correct local transformations induced on the teleported state. We evaluate the quality of teleportation by tracing the preserved entanglement and fidelity of the teleported two-qubit graph state from its density matrix. In the real-machine experiments, we demonstrate that 58% of the teleported state's entanglement is sustained with a measured two-qubit negativity of $0.291\pm0.018$ after three complete revolutions around the hamster wheel, or equivalently, after hopping across 56 qubits. On the machine-specific noisy emulator, we found that the teleported state after 100 hops still sustained 45% of its entanglement. By performing teleportation along a regenerating graph state, our work is a step forward in demonstrating the feasibility of measurement-based quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum strategy from nonlocal games to improve the stabilizer approximation we proposed previously. The resulting approach turns out to be a qubit-by-qubit gauging procedure for standard stabilizers, which could involve discrete or continuous gauge parameters. We take examples from many-body physics and quantum chemistry to show such a procedure leads to an improvement of the performance.</description>

      <title>Exploration of optimal hyperfine transitions for spin-wave storage in $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dependence of the magnetic fluctuations and the spin coherence time $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ of the lowest Stark states $^4I_{15/2}\ (Z_1)$ in $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ under zero magnetic field on Er concentration is numerically investigated in the range of 10 to 10$^6$ parts per million (ppm). The magnetic fluctuations surrounding the target Er electron generated by the dipole-dipole interaction due to two components, Y ions in host crystal and doped Er ions, are calculated by Monte-Carlo method. The former magnetic fluctuation is constant, while the latter depends on Er concentration. Due to these two components, the Er-concentration dependence of $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ at the zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) points saturates for crystals with Er concentration below 10 ppm and no extension of the $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ is expected without an external magnetic field. Under a magnetic field, the longest $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ at a particular ZEFOZ point is expected to be over 150 s (90 s) for site 1 (site 2), which is $\sim 10^5$ times longer than that at zero field for 10-ppm $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$. Interestingly, the ZEFOZ points under a magnetic field appear almost along the one direction for site 1 and almost in one plane for site 2 in optical frame $(D_1, D_2, b)$. The experiment favors this trend in the position of the ZEFOZ points which can be explained on the basis of the anisotropy of the effective spin Hamiltonian parameters. Finally, the tolerance of the ZEFOZ point at each site with the longest $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ against the errors in the applied magnetic field vector is evaluated numerically.</description>

      <title>No quantum advantage for violating fixed-order inequalities?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In standard quantum theory, the causal relations between operations are fixed. One can relax this notion by allowing for dynamical arrangements, where operations may influence the causal relations of future operations, as certified by violation of fixed-order inequalities, e.g., the k-cycle inequalities. Another, non-causal, departure further relaxes these limitations, and is certified by violations of causal inequalities. In this paper, we explore the interplay between dynamic and indefinite causality. We study the k-cycle inequalities and show that the quantum switch violates these inequalities without exploiting its indefinite nature. We further introduce non-adaptive strategies, which effectively remove the dynamical aspect of any process, and show that the k-cycle inequalities become ovel causal inequalities; violating k-cycle inequalities under the restriction of non-adaptive strategies requires non-causal setups. The quantum switch is known to be incapable of violating causal inequalities, and it is believed that a device-independent certification of its causal indefiniteness requires extended setups incorporating spacelike separation. This work reopens the possibility for a device-independent certification of the quantum switch in isolation via fixed-order inequalities instead of causal inequalities. The inequalities we study here, however, turn out to be unsuitable for such a device-independent certification.</description>

      <title>Heralded entanglement of on-demand spin-wave solid-state quantum memories for multiplexed quantum network links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes is a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of the most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding rates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval of stored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite tremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of telecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine narrowband parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories based on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom heralded entanglement between spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable recall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the storage in the spin-state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take advantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feed-forward conditional phase-shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding detector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding rate for a given quantum state up to \SI{500}{\cps}, with a measured positive concurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate the communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional storage scheme with a dead-time of \SI{100}{\micro\second}, leading to an entanglement rate of \SI{22}{\cps} per heralding detector, increased by a factor of 15 thanks to temporal multiplexing. These results establish our architecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate quantum network links.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For multiple hypothesis testing based on classical data samples, we demonstrate a quantum advantage in the optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT), where the privacy and utility measures are set to (quantum) local differential privacy and the pairwise-minimum Chernoff information, respectively. To show the quantum advantage, we consider some class of hypotheses that we coin smoothed point masses. For such hypotheses, we derive an upper bound of the optimal PUT achieved by classical mechanisms, which is tight for some cases, and propose a certain quantum mechanism which achieves a better PUT than the upper bound. The proposed quantum mechanism consists of a classical-quantum channel whose outputs are pure states corresponding to a symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM), and a depolarizing channel.</description>

Abstract: Bell's theorem states that no model that respects Local Causality and Statistical Independence can account for the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics via entangled states. This paper proposes a new approach, using backward-in-time conditional probabilities, which relaxes conventional assumptions of temporal ordering while preserving Statistical Independence as a "fine-tuning condition. It is shown how such models can account for EPR/Bell correlations and, analogously, the GHZ predictions while nevertheless forbidding superluminal signalling.</description>

Abstract: We derive a novel chain rule for a family of channel conditional entropies, covering von Neumann and sandwiched R\'{e}nyi entropies. In the process, we show that these channel conditional entropies are equal to their regularized version, and more generally, additive across tensor products of channels. For the purposes of cryptography, applying our chain rule to sequences of channels yields a new variant of R\'{e}nyi entropy accumulation, in which we can impose some specific forms of marginal-state constraint on the input states to each individual channel. This generalizes a recently introduced security proof technique that was developed to analyze prepare-and-measure QKD with no limitations on the repetition rate. In particular, our generalization yields ``fully adaptive'' protocols that can in principle update the entropy estimation procedure during the protocol itself, similar to the quantum probability estimation framework.</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Non-Local Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are fundamental resources that characterize distinct aspects of a quantum state: entanglement reflects non-local correlations, while magic quantifies the deviation from stabilizer states. A quantum state becomes a valuable resource for applications like universal quantum computation only when both quantities are present. Here, we propose that quantum non-local magic (NM) serves as an effective measure of this combined resource, incorporating both entanglement and magic. We demonstrate that NM can be precisely computed for two-qubit pure states, where it is directly related to the entanglement spectrum. We then extend the definition of NM to mixed states and explore its presence in many-body quantum systems, revealing that the two-point NM decays according to a power law in critical states. Furthermore, we explore measurement-induced NM and uncover an intriguing phenomenon termed "magic swapping", analogous to entanglement swapping, wherein post-measurement NM decays more slowly than any pre-measurement correlations. Our results thus represent a pivotal step towards accurately quantifying the "quantumness" of a state and reveal the potential for manipulating this resource through measurements.</description>

      <title>Local topological order and boundary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a set of axioms for locally topologically ordered quantum spin systems in terms of nets of local ground state projections, and we show they are satisfied by Kitaev's Toric Code and Levin-Wen type models. For a locally topologically ordered spin system on $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$, we define a local net of boundary algebras on $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$, which provides a mathematically precise algebraic description of the holographic dual of the bulk topological order. We construct a canonical quantum channel so that states on the boundary quasi-local algebra parameterize bulk-boundary states without reference to a boundary Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a recent result of Ogata [Ann. H. Poincar\'e 25, 2024] that the bulk cone von Neumann algebra in the Toric Code is of type $\rm{II}$, and we show that Levin-Wen models can have cone algebras of type $\rm{III}$. Finally, we argue that the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules for the net of boundary algebras characterizes the bulk topological order in (2+1)D, and can also be used to characterize the topological order of boundary states.</description>

      <title>Unveiling UV/IR Mixing via Symmetry Defects: A View from Topological Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some topological lattice models in two spatial dimensions exhibit intricate lattice size dependence in their ground state degeneracy (GSD). This and other features such as the position-dependent anyonic excitations are manifestations of UV/IR mixing. In the first part of this paper, we perform an exact calculation of the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) for a specific model, the rank-2 toric code. This analysis includes both contractible and non-contractible boundaries, with the minimum entropy states identified specifically for non-contractible boundaries. Our results show that TEE for a contractible boundary remains independent of lattice size, whereas TEE for non-contractible boundaries, similarly to the GSD, shows intricate lattice-size dependence. In the latter part of the paper we focus on the fact that the rank-2 toric code is an example of a translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, and show that viewing distinct lattice size as a consequence of different translation symmetry defects can explain both our TEE results and the GSD of the rank-2 toric code. Our work establishes the translation symmetry defect framework as a robust description of the UV/IR mixing in topological lattice models.</description>

      <title>The one-dimensional Coulomb Hamiltonian: Properties of its Birman-Schwinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Birman-Schwinger operator for a self-adjoint realisation of the one-dimensional Hamiltonian with the Coulomb potential. We study both the case in which this Hamiltonian is defined on the whole real line and when it is only defined on the positive semiaxis. In both cases, the Birman-Schwinger operator is Hilbert-Schmidt, even though it is not trace class. Then, we have considered some approximations to the Hamiltonian depending on a positive parameter, under given conditions, and proved the convergence of the Birman-Schwinger operators of these approximations to the original Hamiltonian as the parameter goes to zero. Further comments and results have been included.</description>

      <title>Instability of the engineered dark state in two-band fermions under number-conserving dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated quantum many-body states can be created and controlled by the dissipative protocols. Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are particularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically nontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We address this question by examining a general class of models involving a two-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions from the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a guaranteed steady state - a dark state - with a completely filled lower band and an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations governing the long-wavelength and long-time dynamics of the fermion densities and analyze them numerically. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov reaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered dark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a finite density of particles in the upper band. We also estimate the minimum system sizes required to observe this instability in finite systems. Our results suggest that number-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool for stabilizing dark states.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Mixed Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of thermofield double states in systems with mixed phase space, uncovering a direct correlation with the Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner statistics. Our analysis spans two-dimensional random matrix models featuring (I) GOE-Poisson and (II) GUE-Poisson transitions and extends to higher-dimensional cases, including a stringy matrix model (GOE-Poisson) and the mass-deformed SYK model (GUE-Poisson). Krylov complexity consistently emerges as a reliable marker of quantum chaos, displaying a characteristic peak in the chaotic regime that gradually diminishes as the Brody parameter approaches zero, signaling a shift toward integrability. These results establish Krylov complexity as a powerful diagnostic of quantum chaos and highlight its interplay with eigenvalue statistics in mixed phase systems.</description>

      <title>Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</description>

      <title>Ohm's law, Joule heat, and Planckian dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previously, we have shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions. We will demonstrate the importance of it in electron conduction problems in metals in this work. We first revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire connected to an electric battery. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that a sensible explanation is given if the generation of the current is due to the chemical potential gradient generated inside the wire by the battery connection. Next, we demonstrate its importance in the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation of the Josephson relation does not include the capacitor contribution inherently exists in the junction. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force explains the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals.</description>

      <title>Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from conserved current, application to massive scalar boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method applies to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between (covariant) achronal localizations and (covariant) representations of the causal logic thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly one derives the covariant family of representations of the causal logic related to the stress energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. While reaching this result the divergence theorem is proven for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Technology Landscape through Topic Modeling, Expert Involvement, and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, organizations face the challenge of integrating external insights into their decision-making processes to stay competitive. To address this issue, this study proposes a method that combines topic modeling, expert knowledge inputs, and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the detection of technological changes. The method has four main steps: (1) Build a relevant topic model, starting with textual data like documents and reports to find key themes. (2) Create aspect-based topic models. Experts use curated keywords to build models that showcase key domain-specific aspects. (3) Iterative analysis and RL driven refinement: We examine metrics such as topic magnitude, similarity, entropy shifts, and how models change over time. We optimize topic selection with RL. Our reward function balances the diversity and similarity of the topics. (4) Synthesis and operational integration: Each iteration provides insights. In the final phase, the experts check these insights and reach new conclusions. These conclusions are designed for use in the firm's operational processes. The application is tested by forecasting trends in quantum communication. Results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in identifying, ranking, and tracking trends that align with expert input, providing a robust tool for exploring evolving technological landscapes. This research offers a scalable and adaptive solution for organizations to make informed strategic decisions in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>
