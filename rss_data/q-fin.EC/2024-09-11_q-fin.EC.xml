      <title>Patterns of Medical Care Cost by Service Type Associated with Lung Cancer Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Lung cancer screening (LCS) increases early-stage cancer detection which may reduce cancer treatment costs. Little is known about how receipt of LCS affects healthcare costs in real-world clinical settings.
  Methods: This retrospective study analyzed utilization and cost data from the Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process Lung Consortium. We included individuals who met age and smoking LCS eligibility criteria and were engaged within four healthcare systems between February 5, 2015, and December 31, 2021. Generalized linear models estimated healthcare costs from the payer perspective during 12-months prior and 12-months post baseline LCS. We compared these costs to eligible individuals who did not receive LCS. Sensitivity analyses expanded our sample to age-eligible individuals with any smoking history noted in the electronic health record. Secondary analyses examined costs among a sample diagnosed with lung cancer. We reported mean predicted costs with average values for all other explanatory variables.
  Results: We identified 10,049 eligible individuals who received baseline LCS and 15,233 who did not receive baseline LCS. Receipt of baseline LCS was associated with additional costs of $3,698 compared to individuals not receiving LCS. Secondary analyses showed suggestive evidence that LCS prior to cancer diagnosis decreased healthcare costs compared to cancer diagnosed without screening.
  Conclusion: These findings suggest LCS increases healthcare costs in the year following screening. However, LCS also improves early-stage cancer detection and may reduce treatment costs following diagnosis. These results can inform future simulation models to guide LCS recommendations, and aid health policy decision makers on resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Optimal In-Kind Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a model of in-kind redistribution where consumers participate in either a private market or a government-designed program, but not both. We characterize when a social planner, seeking to maximize weighted total surplus, can strictly improve upon the laissez-faire outcome. We show that the optimal mechanism consists of three components: a public option, nonlinear subsidies, and laissez-faire consumption. We quantify the resulting distortions and relate them to the correlation between consumer demand and welfare weights. Our findings reveal that while private market access constrains the social planner's ability to redistribute, it also strengthens the rationale for non-market allocations.</description>

      <title>Contests with sequential moves: An experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study experimentally contests in which players make investment decisions sequentially, and information on prior investments is revealed between stages. Using a between-subject design, we consider all possible sequences in contests of three players and test two major comparative statics of the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium: The positive effect of the number of stages on aggregate investment and earlier mover advantage. The former prediction is decidedly rejected, as we observe a reduction in aggregate investment when more sequential information disclosure stages are added to the contest. The evidence on earlier mover advantage is mixed but mostly does not support theory as well. Both predictions rely critically on large preemptive investment by first movers and accommodation by later movers, which does not materialize. Instead, later movers respond aggressively, and reciprocally, to first movers' investments, while first movers learn to accommodate those responses.</description>

      <title>Evidence gathering under competitive and noncompetitive rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward schemes may affect not only agents' effort, but also their incentives to gather information to reduce the riskiness of the productive activity. In a laboratory experiment using a novel task, we find that the relationship between incentives and evidence gathering depends critically on the availability of information about peers' strategies and outcomes. When no peer information is available, competitive rewards can be associated with more evidence gathering than noncompetitive rewards. In contrast, when decision-makers know what or how their peers are doing, competitive rewards schemes are associated with less active evidence gathering than noncompetitive schemes. The nature of the feedback -- whether subjects receive information about peers' strategies, outcomes, or both -- also affects subjects' incentives to engage in evidence gathering. Specifically, only combined feedback about peers' strategies and performance -- from which subjects may assess the overall relationship between evidence gathering, riskiness, and success -- is associated with less evidence gathering when rewards are based on relative performance; we find no similar effect for noncompetitive rewards.</description>

      <title>Watts and Bots: The Energy Implications of AI Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence, there are expectations for a proportional expansion of economic activity due to increased productivity, and with it energy consumption and its associated environmental consequences like carbon dioxide emissions. Here, we combine data on economic activity, with early estimates of likely adoption of AI across occupations and industries, to estimate the increase in energy use and carbon dioxide emissions at the industry level and in aggregate for the US economy. At the industry level, energy use can increase between 0 and 12 PJ per year, while emissions increase between 47 tCO$_2$ and 272 ktCO$_2$. Aggregating across industries in the US economy, this totals an increase in energy consumption of 28 PJ per year, or around 0.03% of energy use per year in the US. We find this translates to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions of 896 ktCO$_2$ per year, or around 0.02% of the CO$_2$ emissions per year in the US.</description>

      <title>The Accuracy of Job Seekers' Wage Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the accuracy of job seekers' wage expectations by comparing subjective beliefs to objective benchmarks using linked administrative and survey data. Our findings show that especially job seekers with low objective earnings potential and those predicted to face a penalty compared to their pre-unemployment wage display overly optimistic wage expectations. Moreover, wage optimism is amplified by increased job search incentives and job seekers with overoptimistic wage expectations tend to overestimate their reemployment chances. We discuss the labor market implications of wage optimism, as well as the role of information frictions and motivated beliefs as sources of overoptimism.</description>
