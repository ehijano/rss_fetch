      <title>A novel view of the flavor-singlet spectrum from multi-flavor QCD on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SU(3) gauge theories with increasing number of light fermions are the templates of strongly interacting sectors and studying their low-energy dynamics and spectrum is important, both for understanding the strong dynamics of QCD itself, but also for discovering viable UV completions of beyond the Standard Model physics. In order to contrast many-flavors strongly interacting theories with QCD on a quantitative footing, we use Lattice Field Theory simulations. We focus on the study of the flavor-singlet spectrum in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels: this is an interesting probe of the dynamics of the strongly interacting sector, as reminded by the QCD case with the $f_0(500)$ ($\sigma$) and $\eta^\prime$ mesons. The hierarchy of the spectrum of a strongly coupled new gauge sector of the Standard Model defines the potential reach of future colliders for new physics discoveries. In addition to a novel hierarchy with light scalars, introducing many light flavors at fixed number of colors can influence the dynamics of the lightest flavor-singlet pseudoscalar. We present a complete lattice study of both these flavor-singlet channels on high-statistics gauge ensembles generated by the LatKMI collaboration with 4, 8, and 12 copies of light mass-degenerate fermions. We also present other hadron masses on the lightest ensemble for $N_f=8$ generated by the LatKMI collaboration and discuss the chiral extrapolation of the spectrum in this particular theory. We contrast the results to $N_f=4$ simulations and previous results of $N_f=12$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Center-vortex semiclassics with non-minimal 't Hooft fluxes on $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ and center stabilization at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the semiclassical description of confinement for $4$d $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on small $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ with non-minimal 't Hooft twist $p$ with $\gcd(N,p)=1$. For this purpose, we construct the self-dual center vortex for non-minimal 't Hooft twists from the Kraan-van Baal-Lee-Lu-Yi (KvBLLY) monopoles by using the $3$d Abelianized description of $SU(N)$ gauge fields on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with nontrivial holonomy backgrounds. This construction shows the self-dual vortex has (1) the fractional magnetic charge $q/N$ with $pq=1$ mod $N$, (2) the fractional topological charge $1/N$, and (3) the fractional instanton action $S_{\mathrm{YM}}=8\pi^2/(Ng^2)$. The confinement vacua for $NL\Lambda\ll 1$ can be described by the dilute gas approximation of center vortices, and we give the semiclassical formula for the $\theta$ dependence and confining string tensions. We apply this result to understand the suitable choice of the twist $p$ for center stabilization at large $N$. In particular, we test the proposal using the Fibonacci sequence, $N=F_{n+2}$ and $p=F_n$, suggested in studies of the twisted Eguchi-Kawai model, from the viewpoint of the $1$-form and $0$-form center symmetries.</description>

      <title>Fermion Doubling in Quantum Cellular Automaton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of particles on a lattice, through local unitaries. Because $\Delta_x=\Delta_t=\varepsilon$, QCA constitute a privileged framework to cast the digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum particles, e.g. $(3+1)$-QED. But before they can be adopted, simulation schemes for high energy physics need prove themselves against specific numerical issues -- of which the most infamous in Fermion Doubling (FD). FD is well-understood in the discrete-space continuous-time setting of Lattice Gauge Theories as the appearance of spurious solutions for all $\Delta_x=\varepsilon\neq 0$. We rigorously extend its analysis to discrete-space discrete-time. We demonstrate the existence of FD issues in QCA. By applying a covering map on the Brillouin zone, we provide a flavouring-without-staggering way of fixing FD that does not break linearity nor the chiral symmetry. We explain how this method coexists with Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, and illustrate this with a neutrino-like QCA.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamics of three-dimensional $Z_N$ gauge models and the inverted XY universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical relaxational dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) lattice $Z_N$ gauge models with $N=6$ and $N=8$, whose equilibrium critical behavior at their topological transitions belongs to the inverted XY (IXY) universality class (this is also the universality class of the continuous transitions of the 3D lattice U(1) gauge Higgs models with a one-component complex scalar field), which is connected to the standard XY universality class by a nonlocal duality relation of the partition functions. Specifically, we consider the purely relaxational dynamics realized by a locally reversible Metropolis dynamics, as commonly used in Monte Carlo simulations. To determine the corresponding dynamic exponent $z$, we focus on the out-of-equilibrium critical relaxational flows arising from instantaneous quenches to the critical point, which are analyzed within an out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling framework. We obtain the estimate $z=2.59(3)$. A numerical analysis of the equilibrium critical dynamics give consistent, but less accurate, results. This dynamic exponent is expected to characterize the critical slowing down of the purely relaxational dynamics of all topological transitions that belong to the 3D IXY universality class. We note that this result implies that the critical relaxational dynamics of the 3D IXY universality class is slower than that of the standard 3D XY universality class, whose relaxational dynamic exponent $z\approx 2.02$ is significantly smaller, although they share the same length-scale critical exponent $\nu\approx 0.6717$.</description>

      <title>The two-loop energy-momentum tensor within the gradient-flow formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.09837v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gradient-flow formulation of the energy-momentum tensor of QCD is extended to NNLO perturbation theory. This means that the Wilson coefficients which multiply the flowed operators in the corresponding expression for the regular energy-momentum tensor are calculated to this order. The result has been obtained by applying modern tools of regular perturbation theory, reducing the occurring two-loop integrals, which also include flow-time integrations, to a small set of master integrals which can be calculated analytically.</description>

      <title>Evaluating matrix power series with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cayley-Hamilton theorem is used to implement an iterative process for the efficient numerical computation of matrix power series and their differentials. In addition to straight-forward applications in lattice gauge theory simulations e.g. to reduce the computational cost of smearing, the method can also be used to simplify the evaluation of SU(N) one-link integrals or the computation of SU(N) matrix logarithms.</description>

      <title>The density of states method for symplectic gauge theories at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor in the 2D Ising CFT in full modular space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of lattice operators for the energy-momentum (EM) tensor in the Ising CFT is derived in the spin variables. Our expression works under arbitrary affine transformation both on triangular and hexagonal lattices (where the former includes the rectangular lattices). The correctness of the operators is numerically confirmed in Monte Carlo calculations by comparing the results with the conformal Ward identity, including the operator normalization. In the derivation of the EM tensor, a staggered structure of the affine-transformed hexagonal lattice is analyzed, which shows a peculiar shift from the circumcenter dual lattice and appears as a mixing angle between the holomorphic part $T(z)$ and the antiholomorphic part $\tilde T(\bar z)$. The details of this contribution will appear in a subsequent paper.</description>

      <title>Block encoding bosons by signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Block Encoding (BE) is a crucial subroutine in many modern quantum algorithms, including those with near-optimal scaling for simulating quantum many-body systems, which often rely on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Currently, the primary methods for constructing BEs are the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and the sparse oracle approach. In this work, we demonstrate that QSP-based techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) and Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary Matrices (QETU), can themselves be efficiently utilized for BE implementation. Specifically, we present several examples of using QSVT and QETU algorithms, along with their combinations, to block encode Hamiltonians for lattice bosons, an essential ingredient in simulations of high-energy physics. We also introduce a straightforward approach to BE based on the exact implementation of Linear Operators Via Exponentiation and LCU (LOVE-LCU). We find that, while using QSVT for BE results in the best asymptotic gate count scaling with the number of qubits per site, LOVE-LCU outperforms all other methods for operators acting on up to $\lesssim11$ qubits, highlighting the importance of concrete circuit constructions over mere comparisons of asymptotic scalings. Using LOVE-LCU to implement the BE, we simulate the time evolution of single-site and two-site systems in the lattice $\varphi^4$ theory using the Generalized QSP algorithm and compare the gate counts to those required for Trotter simulation.</description>
