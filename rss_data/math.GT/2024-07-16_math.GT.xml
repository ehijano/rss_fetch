      <title>Computing the Khovanov homology of 2 strand braid links via generators and relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "Homfly polynomial via an invariant of colored plane graphs", Murakami, Ohtsuki, and Yamada provide a state-sum description of the level $n$ Jones polynomial of an oriented link in terms of a suitable braided monoidal category whose morphisms are $\mathbb{Q}[q,q^{-1}]$-linear combinations of oriented trivalent planar graphs, and give a corresponding description for the HOMFLY-PT polynomial. We extend this construction and express the Khovanov-Rozansky homology of an oriented link in terms of a combinatorially defined category whose morphisms are equivalence classes of formal complexes of (formal direct sums of shifted) oriented trivalent plane graphs. By working combinatorially, one avoids many of the computational difficulties involved in the matrix factorization computations of the original Khovanov-Rozansky formulation: one systematically uses combinatorial relations satisfied by these matrix factorizations to simplify the computation at a level that is easily handled. By using this technique, we are able to provide a computation of the level $n$ Khovanov-Rozansky invariant of the 2-strand braid link with $k$ crossings, for arbitrary $n$ and $k$, confirming and extending previous results and conjectural predictions by Anokhina-Morozov, Beliakova-Putyra-Wehrli, Carqueville-Murfet, Dolotin-Morozov, Gukov-Iqbal-Kozcaz-Vafa, Nizami-Munir-Sohail-Usman, and Rasmussen.</description>

      <title>On the genera of symmetric unions of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of ribbon knots, Lamm introduced symmetric unions inspired by earlier work of Kinoshita and Terasaka. We show an identity between the twisted Alexander polynomials of a symmetric union and its partial knot. As a corollary, we obtain an inequality concerning their genera. It is known that there exists an epimorphism between their knot groups, and thus our inequality provides a positive answer to an old problem of Jonathan Simon in this case. Our formula also offers a useful condition to constrain possible symmetric union presentations of a given ribbon knot. It is an open question whether every ribbon knot is a symmetric union.</description>

      <title>Minimal simplicial degree $d$ self-maps of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\times \mathbb{S}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of a map between orientable manifolds is a fundamental concept in topology that aids in understanding the structure and properties of the manifolds and the maps between them. Numerous studies have been conducted on the degree of maps between orientable topological spaces. For each $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, we construct a degree $ d$ simplicial map from a $(2(n+1) \max\{|d|,1\})$-facet colored triangulation of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^1$ to the standard $ 2(n+1) $-facet colored triangulation of $ \mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^1 $. We demonstrate that these are the minimal possible colored triangulations for a degree $d $ simplicial self-map of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^1 $, where $n \geq 2 $. Additionally, we construct a minimal degree $d $ simplicial map from a closed orientable $ n$-manifold to $ \mathbb{S}^n $, where $n \geq 1 $.</description>

      <title>Simplifying generic smooth maps to the 2-sphere and to the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how to construct explicit deformations of generic smooth maps from closed $n$--dimensional manifolds $M$ with $n \geq 4$ to the $2$--sphere $S^2$ and show that every smooth map $M \to S^2$ is homotopic to a $C^\infty$ stable map with at most one cusp point and with only folds of the middle absolute index. Furthermore, if $n$ is even, such a $C^\infty$ stable map can be so constructed that the restriction to the singular point set is a topological embedding. As a corollary, we show that for $n \geq 4$ even, there always exists a $C^\infty$ stable map $M \to \mathbb{R}^2$ with at most one cusp point such that the restriction to the singular point set is a topological embedding. As another corollary, we give a new proof to the existence of an open book structure on odd dimensional manifolds which extends a given one on the boundary, originally due to Quinn. Finally, using the open book structure thus constructed, we show that $k$--connected $n$--dimensional manifolds always admit a fold map into $\mathbb{R}^2$ without folds of absolute indices $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq k$, for $n \geq 7$ odd and $1 \leq k &lt; (n-3)/2$.</description>

      <title>Locally measure preserving property of bi-Lipschitz maps between Moran sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In literature it is shown that bi-Lipschitz maps between self-similar sets or self-affine sets enjoy a locally measure preserving property, namely, if $f:(E,\mu)\to (F,\nu)$ is a bi-Lipschitz map, then the Radon-Nykodym derivative $df^*\nu/d\mu$ is a constant function on a subset $E'\subset E$ with $\mu(E')&gt;0$, where $f^*\nu(\cdot)=\nu(f(\cdot))$. Indeed, this measure preserving property plays an important role in Lipschitz classification of fractal sets. In this paper, we show that such measure preserving property also holds for bi-Lipschitz maps between two Moran sets in a certain class.</description>

      <title>On the twin-width of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on Whitney's classical method of triangulating smooth manifolds, we show that every compact $d$-dimensional smooth manifold admits a triangulation with dual graph of twin-width at most $d^{O(d)}$. In particular, it follows that every compact 3-manifold has a triangulation with dual graph of bounded twin-width. This is in sharp contrast to the case of treewidth, where for any natural number $n$ there exists a closed 3-manifold such that every triangulation thereof has dual graph with treewidth at least $n$. To establish this result, we bound the twin-width of the incidence graph of the $d$-skeleton of the second barycentric subdivision of the $2d$-dimensional hypercubic honeycomb. We also show that every compact, piecewise-linear (hence smooth) $d$-dimensional manifold has triangulations where the dual graph has an arbitrarily large twin-width.</description>

Abstract: Let $c(K)$ denote the crossing number of a knot $K$ and let $K_1\# K_2$ denote the connected sum of two oriented knots $K_1$ and $K_2$. It is a very old unsolved question that whether $c(K_1\# K_2)=c(K_1)+c(K_2)$. In this paper we show that $c(K_1\# K_2)&gt; (c(K_1)+c(K_2))/16$.</description>

      <title>The worldsheet skein D-module and basic curves on Lagrangian fillings of the Hopf link conormal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HOMFLYPT polynomials of knots in the 3-sphere in symmetric representations satisfy recursion relations. Their geometric origin is holomorphic curves at infinity on knot conormals that determine a $D$-module with characteristic variety the Legendrian knot conormal augmention variety and with the recursion relations as operator polynomial generators [arXiv:1304.5778, arXiv:1803.04011]. We consider skein lifts of recursions and $D$-modules corresponding to skein valued open curve counts [arXiv:1901.08027] that encode HOMFLYPT polynomials colored by arbitrary partitions. We define a worldsheet skein module which is the universal target for skein curve counts and a corresponding $D$-module.
  We then consider the concrete example of the Legendrian conormal of the Hopf link. We show that the worldsheet skein $D$-module for the Hopf link conormal is generated by three operator polynomials that annihilate the skein valued partition function for any choice of Lagrangian filling and recursively determine it uniquely. We find Lagrangian fillings for any point in the augmentation variety and show that their skein valued partition functions admit quiver-like expansions where all holomorphic curves are generated by a small number of basic holomorphic disks and annuli and their multiple covers.</description>

      <title>A manifestly Morita-invariant construction of Turaev-Viro invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a state sum construction that assigns a scalar to a skeleton in a closed oriented three-dimensional manifold. The input datum is the pivotal bicategory $\mathbf{Mod}^{\mathrm{sph}}(\mathcal{A})$ of spherical module categories over a spherical fusion category $\mathcal{A}$.
  The interplay of algebraic structures in this pivotal bicategory with moves of skeleta ensures that our state sum is independent of the skeleton on the manifold. We show that the bicategorical invariant recovers the value of the standard Turaev-Viro invariant associated to $\mathcal{A}$, thereby proving the independence of the Turaev-Viro invariant under pivotal Morita equivalence without recurring to the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction.
  A key ingredient for the construction is the evaluation of graphs on the sphere with labels in $\mathbf{Mod}^{\mathrm{sph}}(\mathcal{A})$ that we develop in this article. A central tool are Nakayama-twisted traces on pivotal bimodule categories which we study beyond semisimplicity.</description>

      <title>From bordisms of three-manifolds to domain walls between topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a correspondence between spin three-manifolds and bosonic abelian topological orders. Let $N$ be a spin three-manifold. We can define a $(2+1)$-dimensional topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$ as follows: its anyons are the torsion elements in $H_1(N)$, the braiding of anyons is given by the linking form, and their topological spins are given by the quadratic refinement of the linking form obtained from the spin structure. Under this correspondence, a surgery presentation of $N$ gives rise to a classical Chern--Simons description of the associated topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$. We then extend the correspondence to spin bordisms between three-manifolds, and domain walls between topological orders. In particular, we construct a domain wall $\mathcal{D}_M$ between $\mathrm{TO}_N$ and $\mathrm{TO}_{N'}$, where $M$ is a spin bordism from $N$ to $N'$. This domain wall unfolds to a composition of a gapped boundary, obtained from anyon condensation, and a gapless Narain boundary CFT.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of twisted Laplacians and random matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rudnick recently proved that the spectral number variance for the Laplacian of a large compact hyperbolic surface converges, in a certain scaling limit and when averaged with respect to the Weil-Petersson measure on moduli space, to the number variance of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random matrix theory. In this note we extend Rudnick's approach to show convergence to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble for twisted Laplacians which break time-reversal symmetry, and to the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble for Dirac operators. This addresses a question of Naud, who obtained analogous results for twisted Laplacians on high genus random covers of a fixed compact surface.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Harmonic Spinors and 1-forms on Connected sums and Torus sums of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a pair of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors (resp. 1-forms) on closed Riemannian 3-manifolds $(Y_1, g_1)$ and $(Y_2,g_2)$, we construct $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors (resp. 1-forms) on the connected sum $Y_1 \# Y_2$ and the torus sum $Y_1 \cup_{T^2} Y_2$ using a gluing argument. The main tool in the proof is a parameterized version of the Nash-Moser implicit function theorem established by Donaldson and the second author. We use these results to construct an abundance of new examples of $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinors and 1-forms. In particular, we prove that for every closed 3-manifold $Y$, there exist infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors with singular sets representing infinitely many distinct isotopy classes of embedded links, strengthening an existence theorem of Doan-Walpuski. Moreover, combining this with previous results, our construction implies that if $b_1(Y) &gt; 0$, there exist infinitely many $\mathrm{spin}^c$ structures on $Y$ such that the moduli space of solutions to the two-spinor Seiberg-Witten equations is non-empty and non-compact.</description>

Abstract: For an oriented $3$-manifold $M$, let $\mathcal{S}(M)$ denote its Kauffman bracket skein module over $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}]$. It is shown that $\mathcal{S}(M)$ admits infinitely many torsion elements when $M$ is the exterior of the Montesinos knot $K(a_1/b_1,a_2/b_2,a_3/b_4,a_4/b_4)\subset S^3$ with each $b_i\ge 3$. This provides a negative answer to Problem 1.92 (G)-(i) in the Kirby's list, which asks whether $\mathcal{S}(M)$ is free when $M$ is irreducible and has no incompressible non-boundary parallel torus.</description>

      <title>Large-$n$ asymptotics for Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry and spectral theory of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with genus-$g$ and $n$ cusps in the large-$n$ limit. We show that for a random hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ with $n$ large, the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues is linear in $n$ with high probability. By work of Ballmann, Matthiesen and Mondal [7], this result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We also study the relative frequency of simple and non-simple closed geodesics, showing that on random surfaces with many cusps, most closed geodesics with lengths up to $\log(n)$ scales are non-simple. Our main technical contribution is a novel large-$n$ asymptotic formula for the Weil-Petersson volume $V_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of genus-$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $k$ geodesic boundary components and $n-k$ cusps with $k$ fixed, building on work of Manin and Zograf [31].</description>

Abstract: A delta-move is a local move on a link diagram. The delta-Gordian distance between links measures the minimum number of delta-moves needed to move between link diagrams. A self delta-move only involves a single component of a link whereas a mixed delta-move involves multiple (2 or 3) components. We prove that two links are mixed delta-equivalent precisely when they have the same pairwise linking number and same components; we also give a number of results on how (mixed/self) delta-moves relate to classical link invariants including the Arf invariant and crossing number. This allows us to produce a graph showing links related by a self delta-move for algebraically split links with up to 9-crossings. For these links we also introduce and calculate the delta-splitting number and mixed delta-splitting number, that is, the minimum number of delta-moves needed to separate the components of the link.</description>

      <title>Directional Invariants of Doubly Periodic Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we define novel topological invariants of doubly periodic tangles (DP tangles). DP tangles are embeddings of curves in the thickened plane with translational symmetries in two independent directions. We first organize the components of a DP tangle into different interlinked compounds, which are invariants of a DP tangle. The notion of interlinked compound leads to the classification of DP tangles according to their directional type. We then prove that the directional type is an invariant of DP tangles using the concept of axis-motif, which can be viewed as the blueprint of a DP tangle.</description>

      <title>A braidoid equivalence for spherical knotoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Braidoids form a counterpart theory to the theory of planar knotoids, just as braids do for three-dimensional links. As such, planar knotoid diagrams represent the same knotoid in $\mathbb{R}^2$ if and only if they can be presented as the closure of two labeled braidoid diagrams related by an equivalence relation, named $L$-equivalence. In this paper, we refine the notion of $L$-equivalence of braidoid diagrams in order to obtain an equivalence theorem for (multi)-knotoid diagrams in $S^2$ when represented as the closure of labeled braidoid diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifolds that we call mixed-platonic, composed of regular ideal hyperbolic polyhedra of more than one type, which includes certain previously-known examples. We establish basic facts about mixed-platonic manifolds which allow us to conclude, among other things, that there is no mixed-platonic hyperbolic knot complement with hidden symmetries.</description>

      <title>Homology Covers and Automorphisms: Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each integer $k \geq 2$ or $k=\infty$, one can associate to each Riemann surface $S$ its $k$-homoly cover $\widetilde{S}_{k}$. This surface admits a group of conformal automorphisms $M_{k} \cong {\rm H}_{1}(S;{\mathbb Z}_{k})$, where ${\mathbb Z}_{\infty}={\mathbb Z}$, such that $S=\widetilde{S}_{k}/M_{k}$. If $L \leq {\rm Aut}(S)$, then there is a short exact sequence $1 \to M_{k} \to \widetilde{L}_{k} \to L \to 1$, where $\widetilde{L}_{k}$ is a subgroup of conformal automorphisms of $\widetilde{S}_{k}$.
  If $k \neq \infty$ and $S$ is analytically finite and non-exceptional, then $M_{k}$, $\widetilde{L}_{k}$ and $L$ are finite groups. In this case, if $k$ and $|L|$, the order $|L|$ of $L$ are relatively prime integers, then the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem asserts that $\widetilde{L}_{k} \cong M_{k} \rtimes L$.
  In this paper, we investigate situations when $k$ and $|L|$ are not necessarily relatively primes.</description>

      <title>Floer homology and square pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a version of Lagrangian Floer homology whose chain complex is generated by the inscriptions of a rectangle into a real analytic Jordan curve. By using its associated spectral invariants, we establish that a rectifiable Jordan curve admits inscriptions of a whole interval of rectangles. In particular, it inscribes a square if the area it encloses is more than half that of a circle of equal diameter.</description>

      <title>Generic doubling of rectangular pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a multiplicity result for rectangular pegs that there is a generic class of smooth Jordan curves in which every curve admits two geometrically distinct similar inscribed rectangles with aspect angle in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, based on the a priori existence result of rectangular peg by Greene and Lobb [GL21], in which the rectangular peg problem is translated into finding intersection points of two Lagrangian tori. The key insights are certain generic geometric transversality of the two tori, and the correspondence between the intersection points and the inscribed rectangles. We present two distinct proofs: one involves the Lagrangian Floer homology, and the other is differential topological in nature which employs a novel computation formula for the algebraic intersection number. Moreover, such generic doubling result can be further extended to cyclic quadrilateral pegs based on [GL23]. In Appendix B, written jointly with Urs Frauenfelder, we provide the detailed derivation of this computation formula.</description>
