      <title>Generalizations of noncommutative Noether's problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noether's problem is classical and very important problem in algebra. It is an intrinsecally interesting problem in invariant theory, but with far reaching applications in the sutdy of moduly spaces, PI-algebras, and the Inverse problem of Galois theory, among others. To obtain an noncommutative analogue of Noether's problem, one would needs a significant skew field that shares a role similar to the field of ratioal functions. Given the importance of the Weyl fields due to Gelfand-Kirillov's Conjecture, in 2006 J. Alev and F. Dumas introduced what is nowdays called the noncommutative Noether's problem, using the Weyl fields. Many papers in recent years \cite{FMO}, \cite{EFOS}, \cite{FS}, \cite{Tikaradze} have been dedicated to the subject. The aim of this article is to generalize the main result of \cite{FS} for more general versions of Noether's problem; and consider its analogue in prime characteristic.</description>

      <title>Counting core sets in matrix rings over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $M_n(R)$ be the ring of $n \times n$ matrices with entries from $R$. For each $S \subseteq M_n(R)$, we consider its (generalized) null ideal $N(S)$, which is the set of all polynomials $f$ with coefficients from $M_n(R)$ with the property that $f(A) = 0$ for all $A \in S$. The set $S$ is said to be core if $N(S)$ is a two-sided ideal of $M_n(R)[x]$. It is not known how common core sets are among all subsets of $M_n(R)$. We study this problem for $2 \times 2$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field with $q$ elements. We provide exact counts for the number of core subsets of each similarity class of $M_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$. While not every subset of $M_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is core, we prove that as $q \to \infty$, the probability that a subset of $M_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is core approaches 1. Thus, asymptotically in~$q$, almost all subsets of $M_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ are core.</description>

      <title>Local derivations and automorphisms of nilpotent Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of local derivations and automorphisms of nilpotent Lie algebras. Namely, we proved that nilpotent Lie algebras with indices of nilpotency $3$ and $4$ admit local derivation (local automorphisms) which is not a derivation (automorphisms). Further, it is presented a sufficient condition under which a nilpotent Lie algebra admits a local derivation which is not a derivation. With the same condition, it is proved the existence of pure local automorphism on a nilpotent Lie algebra. Finally, we present an $n$-dimensional non-associative algebra for which the space of local derivations coincides with the space of derivations.</description>

      <title>Generalized classical Yang-Baxter equation and regular decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of the paper is on constructing new solutions of the generalized classical Yang-Baxter equation (GCYBE) that are not skew-symmetric. Using regular decompositions of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, we construct Lie algebra decompositions of $\mathfrak{g}(\!(x)\!) \times \mathfrak{g}[x]/x^m \mathfrak{g}[x]$. The latter decompositions are in bijection with the solutions to the GCYBE. Under appropriate regularity conditions, we obtain a partial classification of such solutions. The paper is concluded with the presentations of the Gaudin-type models associated to these solutions.</description>

      <title>Parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation: p-racks, solutions &amp; quantum algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of the parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is established from a purely algebraic point of view. The first step towards this objective is the introduction of certain generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks called parametric (p)-shelves and racks. These objects satisfy a parametric self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Novel, non-reversible solutions are obtained from p-shelve/rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all reversible set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the identity map via a parametric twist. The universal algebras associated to both p-rack and generic parametric, set-theoretic solutions are next presented and the corresponding universal R-matrices are derived. The admissible universal Drinfel'd twist is constructed allowing the derivation of the general set-theoretic universal R-matrix. By introducing the concept of a parametric coproduct we prove the existence of a parametric co-associativity. We show that the parametric coproduct is an algebra homomorphsim and the universal R-matrices satisfy intertwining relations with the algebra coproducts.</description>

      <title>On left braces in which every subbrace is an ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce and study the class of all left braces in which every subbrace is an ideal. We call them Dedekind left braces. It is proved that every finite Dedekind left brace is centrally nilpotent. Structural results about Dedekind left braces and a complete description of those ones whose additive group is elementary abelian are also shown. As a consequence, every hypermultipermutational Dedekind left brace whose additive group is elementary abelian is multipermutational of level $2$. A new class of left braces, the extraspecial left braces, is introduced and plays a prominent role in our approach.</description>

      <title>Generalized electrical Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the electrical Lie algebras originally introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy in several ways. To each Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we associate two types (vertex type and edge type) of the generalized electrical algebras. The electrical Lie algebras of vertex type are always subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$ and are flat deformations of the nilpotent Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. In many cases including $sl_n$, $so_n$, and $sp_{2n}$ we find new (edge) models for our generalized electrical Lie algebras of vertex type. Finding an edge model in general is an interesting an open problem.</description>
