      <title>Semiparametric Bayesian Difference-in-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies semiparametric Bayesian inference for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) within the difference-in-differences research design. We propose two new Bayesian methods with frequentist validity. The first one places a standard Gaussian process prior on the conditional mean function of the control group. We obtain asymptotic equivalence of our Bayesian estimator and an efficient frequentist estimator by establishing a semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorem. The second method is a double robust Bayesian procedure that adjusts the prior distribution of the conditional mean function and subsequently corrects the posterior distribution of the resulting ATT. We establish a semiparametric BvM result under double robust smoothness conditions; i.e., the lack of smoothness of conditional mean functions can be compensated by high regularity of the propensity score, and vice versa. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian DiD methods exhibit strong finite-sample performance compared to existing frequentist methods. Finally, we outline an extension to difference-in-differences with multiple periods and staggered entry.</description>

      <title>Linear Regressions with Combined Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study best linear predictions in a context where the outcome of interest and some of the covariates are observed in two different datasets that cannot be matched. Traditional approaches obtain point identification by relying, often implicitly, on exclusion restrictions. We show that without such restrictions, coefficients of interest can still be partially identified and we derive a constructive characterization of the sharp identified set. We then build on this characterization to develop computationally simple and asymptotically normal estimators of the corresponding bounds. We show that these estimators exhibit good finite sample performances.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effects with Targeting Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.10432v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivalued treatments are commonplace in applications. We explore the use of discrete-valued instruments to control for selection bias in this setting. Our discussion revolves around the concept of targeting: which instruments target which treatments. It allows us to establish conditions under which counterfactual averages and treatment effects are point- or partially-identified for composite complier groups. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework by applying it to data from the Head Start Impact Study. Under a plausible positive selection assumption, we derive informative bounds that suggest less beneficial effects of Head Start expansions than the parametric estimates of Kline and Walters (2016).</description>

      <title>Flexible Covariate Adjustments in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07942v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical regression discontinuity (RD) studies often use covariates to increase the precision of their estimates. In this paper, we propose a novel class of estimators that use such covariate information more efficiently than existing methods and can accommodate many covariates. It involves running a standard RD analysis in which a function of the covariates has been subtracted from the original outcome variable. We characterize the function that leads to the estimator with the smallest asymptotic variance, and consider feasible versions of such estimators in which this function is estimated, for example, through modern machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantile Granger Causality in the Presence of Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for assessing Granger causality in quantiles in unstable environments, for a fixed quantile or over a continuum of quantile levels. Our proposed test statistics are consistent against fixed alternatives, they have nontrivial power against local alternatives, and they are pivotal in certain important special cases. In addition, we show the validity of a bootstrap procedure when asymptotic distributions depend on nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed test statistics have correct empirical size and high power, even in absence of structural breaks. Moreover, a procedure providing additional insight into the timing of Granger causal regimes based on our new tests is proposed. Finally, an empirical application in energy economics highlights the applicability of our method as the new tests provide stronger evidence of Granger causality.</description>

      <title>Learning the Effect of Persuasion via Difference-In-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persuasion rate is a key parameter for measuring the causal effect of a directional message on influencing the recipient's behavior. Its identification has relied on exogenous treatment or the availability of credible instruments, but the requirements are not always satisfied in observational studies. Therefore, we develop a novel econometric framework for the average persuasion rate on the treated and other related parameters by using the difference-in-differences approach. The average treatment effect on the treated is a standard parameter in difference-in-differences, but we show that it is an overly conservative measure in the context of persuasion. For estimation and inference, we propose regression-based approaches as well as semiparametrically efficient estimators. Beginning with the two-period case, we extend the framework to staggered treatment settings, where we show how to conduct richer analyses like the event-study design. We investigate the British election and the Chinese curriculum reform as empirical examples.</description>
