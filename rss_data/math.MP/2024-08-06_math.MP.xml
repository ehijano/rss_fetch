      <title>Notions of Fermionic Entropies of a Causal Fermion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fermionic von Neumann entropy, the fermionic entanglement entropy and the fermionic relative entropy are defined for causal fermion systems. Our definition makes use of entropy formulas for quasi-free fermionic states in terms of the reduced one-particle density operator. Our definitions are illustrated in various examples for Dirac spinors in two- and four-dimensional Minkowski space, in the Schwarzschild black hole geometry and for fermionic lattices. We review area laws for the two-dimensional diamond and a three-dimensional spatial region in Minkowski space. The connection is made to the computation of the relative entropy using modular theory.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we find the Poisson superalgebras related to schemes of quantization. Initially, we consider the Dirac superbracket in the context of the quantization of constrained systems. Next, we show the existence of a Poisson supermanifold in the scenario of quantization deformation.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for the L-operator in the Lax Pair of the Boussinesq equation on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a third-order non-self-adjoint operator, which is an $L$-operator in the Lax pair for the Boussinesq equation on the circle. We construct a mapping from the set of operator coefficients to the set of spectral data, similar to the corresponding mapping for the Hill operator constructed by E. Korotyaev. We prove that in a neighborhood of zero our mapping is analytic and one-to-one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve an inverse problem for a third order differential operator under the 3-point Dirichlet conditions. The third-order operator is an $L$-operator in the Lax pair for the good Boussinesq equation. We construct the mapping from the set of the coefficients to the set of spectral data. This mapping is an analytic bijection on a neighborhood of the zero.</description>

Abstract: We establish quantitative Green's function estimates for a class of quasi-periodic (QP) operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with power-law long-range hopping and analytic cosine type potentials. As applications, we prove the arithmetic version of localization, the finite volume version of $(\frac12-)$-H\"older continuity of the IDS, and the absence of eigenvalues (for Aubry dual operators).</description>

      <title>Cospectral trees indistinguishable by scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let v_1 and v_2 be two distinct vertices of a tree T_0. Let \phi_N^{(i)} (i=1,2) be the characteristic functions of the Sturm-Liouville problem on T_0 rooted at v_i with Neumann conditions at the root and let \phi_D^{(i)} (i=1,2) be the characteristic functions of the Sturm-Liouville problem on T_0 with Dirichlet conditions at the root. We prove that if attaching any tree to T_0 at the vertices v_1 and v_2 leads to cospectral trees and d(v_1)=d(v_2) then \phi_N(\lambda)^{(1)}\equiv \phi_N(\lambda)^{(2)} and \phi_D(\lambda)^{(1)}\equiv \phi_D(\lambda)^{(1)} (which means that the scattering is the same at v_1 and v_2).</description>

      <title>Integrable hierarchies and F-manifolds with compatible connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that F-manifolds with compatible connection $(\nabla,\circ,e)$ are the geometric counterpart of integrable systems of quasilinear first order evolutionary PDEs. We consider F-manifolds equipped with an Euler vector field and assume that the operator $L=E\circ$ is regular. This generalises previous results in the semisimple context. As an example we study regular F-manifolds with compatible connection $(\nabla,\circ,e,E)$ associated with integrable hierarchies obtained from the solutions of the equation $d\cdot d_L \,a_0=0$ by applying the construction of [27]. We show that $n$-dimensional F-manifolds associated to operators $L$ with $r\le n$ Jordan blocks $L_\alpha$ of size $m_\alpha$ are classified by $n$ arbitrary functions of a single variable, where each block $L_\alpha$ contributes with $m_\alpha$ functions of the variable appearing in the diagonal of the block. In the case of a single Jordan block of arbitrary size we show that flat connections $\nabla$ correspond to linear solutions $a_0$. This generalises part of the construction of [31] where special linear solutions were considered. We illustrate the construction in dimensions $2,3,$ and $4$ for any choice of Jordan canonical form and any choice of the corresponding solution $a_0$. In these dimensions we have that linear solutions define bi-flat F-manifolds, and that the special linear solutions studied in [31] are related to Riemannian F-manifolds with Killing unit vector field. We conjecture that this is true in general.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with $O(1)$-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states $\unicode{x2013}$ states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium $\unicode{x2013}$ has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements. Beyond these hardness results, we present a lower bound on the temperatures that Gibbs states become easy to sample from classically in terms of the maximum degree of the Hamiltonian's interaction graph.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow in parameter space is equivalent to linear interpolation in output space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the usual gradient flow in parameter space that underlies many training algorithms for neural networks in deep learning can be continuously deformed into an adapted gradient flow which yields (constrained) Euclidean gradient flow in output space. Moreover, if the Jacobian of the outputs with respect to the parameters is full rank (for fixed training data), then the time variable can be reparametrized so that the resulting flow is simply linear interpolation, and a global minimum can be achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA for different boundary topologies, i.e. sphere and torus, using super-Virasoro TQFT. We use fusion and modular kernels of the super-Liouville theory to compute the necklace-channel conformal block and showcase formalism by proving that the inner product holds for superconformal blocks, defined as states in the Hilbert space. Finally, we compute the out-of-time-order correlator for the torus topology with superconformal primary insertions as matter using the tools of super-Virasoro TQFT and investigate its early-time behaviour.</description>

      <title>Relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the transport equations from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation when the velocity space is spherically symmetric. The Shkarofsky form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth collision operator is employed in the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. A relaxation model for homogeneous plasma could be presented in closed form in terms of Gauss HyperGeometric2F1 functions. This has been accomplished based on the Maxwellian mixture model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classic models such as two-temperature thermal equilibrium model, Braginskii model and thermodynamic equilibrium model are special cases of our relaxation model. The present relaxation model is a nonequilibrium model which is under the assumption that the plasma system possesses finitely distinguishable independent features, but it is not relying on the conventional near-equilibrium assumption.</description>

      <title>Einstein's equations constrained by homogeneous and isotropic expansion: Initial value problems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we put forth a general scheme for defining initial value problems from Einstein's equations of General Relativity constrained by homogeneous and isotropic expansion. The cosmological models arising as solutions are naturally interpreted as spatially homogeneous and isotropic on ``large scales". In order to show the well-posedness and applicability of such a scheme, we specialize in a class of spacetimes filled with the general homogeneous perfect fluid and inhomogeneous viscoelastic matter. We prove the existence, uniqueness, and relative stability of solutions, and an additional inequality for the energy density. As a consequence of our theorems, a new mechanism of energy transfer appears involving the different components of matter. A class of exact solutions is also obtained to exemplify the general results.</description>

Abstract: The methods of Information geometry have been glowing up to develop various subjects of theoretical physics, including quantum information systems. The present article has two purposes. The first one is to develop general theory of homogeneous statistical manifolds. In particular we construct explicit examples of homogeneous statistical manifolds of low dimension. The second purpose is to classify $3$-dimensional Lie groups admitting non-trivial conjugate symmetric left invariant statistical structure.</description>

      <title>Leading correction to the relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For Dirac particles interacting with external fields, we use the exact operator of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation obtained by Eriksen and rigorously derive a leading correction in the weak-field approximation to the known relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we carry out the operator extraction of a square root in the Eriksen operator. The derived correction is important for the scattering of relativistic particles. Since the description of this scattering by a relativistic wave equation of the second order is more convenient, we determine a general connection between relativisic wave equations of the first and second orders. For Dirac particles, the relativisic wave equation of the second order is obtained with the correction similar to that to the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>New edge modes and corner charges for first-order symmetries of 4D gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a set of noncommuting frame-translation symmetries in 4D gravity in tetrad-connection variables, which allow expressing diffeomorphisms as composite transformations. Working on the phase space level for finite regions, we pay close attention to the corner piece of the generators, discuss various possible charge brackets, relative definitions of the charges, coupling to spinors and relations to other charges. What emerges is a picture of the symmetries and edge modes of gravity that bears local resemblance to a Poincare group $SO(1,3)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, but possesses structure functions. In particular, we argue that the symmetries and charges presented here are more amenable to discretisation, and sketch a strategy for this charge algebra, geared toward quantum gravity applications.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Some Integrals over Gaussian Measure with Nuclear Covariance Operator in Separable Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to construct convergent series for the approximate calculation of certain integrals over the Gaussian measure with a nuclear covariance operator, nonlocal propagator, in separable Hilbert space. Such series arise, for example, in the model with the interaction Lagrangian $\sinh^{2(p+1)}\varphi$, where $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varphi$ is the scalar field, although the problem can be solved in general form for a fairly wide class of Lagrangians: an even, strictly convex, continuous, non-negative function with a single zero value for $\varphi=0$ and for $|\varphi|\rightarrow +\infty$ growing faster than $\varphi^{2}$. We strictly define the scattering matrix, $\mathcal{S}$-matrix, at the zero value of the classical field, argument of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix, of such a theory in terms of the corresponding integral, find the iterated expansion for the integrand (the Gaussian measure doesn't expand) over two orthonormal bases of functions, prove the validity of summation and integration interchange and thus find the expansion of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix at the zero value of the classical field into the iterated series in powers of the interaction action. The individual terms of the resulting series have the form of a canonical partition function (CPF), and the methods of statistical physics are applicable to them. In particular, we express them in terms of Bell polynomials. It is important to note that such iterated series cannot be reduced to the perturbation theory (PT) series, since in the proposed model the latter diverges as $e^{n^{2}}$, where $n \in \mathbb {N}$ is the PT order. Along the way, we provide detailed mathematical background, including Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem (MCT) and Henri Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem (DCT), without which the presented calculation would be significantly more complex.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of many-body localized systems: logarithmic lightcones and $\log \, t$-law of $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional spin systems. The XXZ model with disorder is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOMs), but assuming instead a logarithmic lightcone we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation of $ \alpha$-R\'enyi entropies, $ 0&lt; \alpha&lt;1 $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law. Assuming the existence of LIOMs we prove that the Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic lightcone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy, from a generic initial product state, has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</description>

      <title>Exponential tail estimates for quantum lattice dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of a particle on a lattice for large times. Assuming translation invariance, and either discrete or continuous time parameter, the distribution of the ballistically scaled position $Q(t)/t$ converges weakly to a distribution that is compactly supported in velocity space, essentially the distribution of group velocity in the initial state. We show that the total probability of velocities strictly outside the support of the asymptotic measure goes to zero exponentially with $t$, and we provide a simple method to estimate the exponential rate uniformly in the initial state. Near the boundary of the allowed region the rate function goes to zero like the power 3/2 of the distance to the boundary. The method is illustrated in several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key question in the analysis of discrete models for material defects, such as vortices in spin systems and superconductors or isolated dislocations in metals, is whether information on boundary energy for a domain can be sufficient for controlling the number of defects in the interior. We present a general combinatorial dipole-removal argument for a large class of discrete models including XY systems and screw dislocation models, allowing to prove sharp conditions under which controlled flux and boundary energy guarantee to have minimizers with zero or one charges in the interior. The argument uses the max-flow min-cut theorem in combination with an ad-hoc duality for planar graphs, and is robust with respect to changes of the function defining the interaction energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we study Landis conjecture for positive Schr\"odinger operators on graphs. More precisely, we give a decay criterion that ensures when $ \mathcal{H} $-harmonic functions for a positive Schr\"odinger operator $ \mathcal{H} $ with potentials bounded from above by $ 1 $ are trivial. We then specifically look at the special cases of $ \mathbb{Z}^{d} $ and regular trees for which we get explicit decay criterion. Moreover, we consider the fractional analogue of Landis conjecture on $ \mathbb{Z}^{d} $. Our approach relies on the discrete version of Liouville comparison principle which is also proved in this article.</description>

      <title>Potential Hessian Ascent: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first iterative spectral algorithm to find near-optima of a random quadratic objective over the discrete hypercube. The algorithm is a randomized Hessian ascent in the solid cube, where we modify the objective by subtracting a specific instance-independent potential function [Chen et al., Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 76(7), 2023]. This extends Subag's algorithmic program of Hessian ascent from the sphere [Subag, Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 74(5), 2021] to the more complex geometry of the cube.
  Utilizing tools from free probability theory, we construct an approximate projector into the top-eigenspaces of the Hessian with well-behaved diagonal entries, and use it as the covariance matrix for the random increments. With high probability, the empirical distribution of the iterates approximates the solution to the primal version of the Auffinger-Chen SDE [Auffinger et al., Communications in Mathematical Physics, 335, 2015]. We then bound the change to the modified objective function for every iterate via a Taylor expansion whose derivatives are controlled using various Gaussian concentration bounds and smoothness properties of (a semiconcave regularization of) the Fenchel-Legendre dual to the solution of the Parisi PDE.
  These results lay the groundwork for demonstrating the (possible) existence of low-degree sum-of-squares certificates over high-entropy step distributions for a relaxed version of the Parisi formula [Open Question 1.8, arXiv:2401.14383].</description>

Abstract: In the framework of quasi-Hermitian quantum mechanics it is shown that a weakening of the isotropy of the Hilbert-space geometry can help us to enlarge the domain of the parameters at which the evolution is unitary.

      <title>Quasi-classical Limit of a Spin Coupled to a Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin (qubit) is in contact with a bosonic reservoir. The state of the reservoir contains a parameter {\varepsilon} interpolating between quantum and classical reservoir features. We derive the explicit expression for the time-dependent reduced spin density matrix, valid for all values of {\varepsilon} and for energy conserving interactions. We study decoherence and markovianity properties. Our main finding is that the spin decoherence is enhanced (full decoherence) when the spin is coupled to quantum reservoir states while it is dampened (partial decoherence) when coupled to classical reservoir states. The markovianity properties depend in a subtle way on the classicality parameter {\varepsilon} and on the finer details of the spin-reservoir interaction. We further examine scattering and periodicity properties for energy exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ via Fujii-Wetterich model in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Fujii-Wetterich model [Phys.Rev.D 26, 2580 (1982) and Nucl.Phys.B 302, 645 (1988)] which allows the Higgs doublet to couple with a "cosmon" scalar $\chi$ of the background spacetime as $\chi^2\,\Phi^2$. Upon the SSB of the $SU(2)$ gauge, the VEV of the Higgs doublet is proportional to the field $\chi$. Fujii and Wetterich employed this linkage to make particle masses dependent on $\chi$. We shall present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: at a given point $x^*$, the prevailing Higgs VEV will be used to $\textit construct$ a quantum of action $\hbar_*$ and a speed of light $c_*$ in association with $\chi(x^*)$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$, whereas particle masses induced via Higgs SSB remain independent of $\chi(x^*)$. Our mechanism unambiguously generates the dependencies $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these "fundamental constants" to vary along with the dynamical field $\chi$ across the manifold. For late-time cosmology, a varying $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards Earth renders the classic Lema\^itre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-1}$ inapplicable. Using the dependency $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, we derive the new (variable-$c$) Lema\^itre redshift relation and apply it to analyze the Pantheon Catalog of SneIa $\textit without$ invoking the dark energy hypothesis. Key consequences are: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog with a fit exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model; (2) Explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration based on variable $c$, eliminating the need for dark energy; (3) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)].</description>

      <title>Differential Cohomology as Diffeological Homotopy Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin homotopies, introduced by Caetano-Picken, serve to axiomatize the holonomy of connections on principal bundles. This approach has been generalized to higher non-abelian bundles with connection through transport functors and higher holonomies, at least in dimension two and partially in dimension three. In this thesis, we introduce a new variant of thin homotopy based on the definition of skeletal diffeologies introduced recently by Kihara and show that, in the abelian setting, ordinary differential cohomology can be completely recovered in terms of the homotopy theory of skeletal diffeological spaces. Specifically, to any smooth manifold and non-negative integer $k$, we associate a $k$-skeletal simplicial presheaf such that its $k$th cohomology with values in the circle group is isomorphic to the abelian group of Cheeger-Simons differential characters. Further, we relate these higher holonomies to the only other existing model in the literature, developed by Gajer based on the geometric loop group. The main motivation for us is to provide a model where the differential refinement is established by refining the underlying space, rather than the coefficient object. This has the advantage of possible generalizations to non-abelian differential cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability of the cosmological region of Kerr de Sitter spacetimes. More precisely, we show that solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant arising from data on a cylinder that is uniformly close to the Kerr de Sitter geometry (with possibly different mass and angular momentum parameters at either end) are future geodesically complete and display asymptotically de Sitter-like degrees of freedom. The proof uses an ADM formulation of the Einstein equations in parabolic gauge. Together with a well-known theorem of Hintz-Vasy [Acta Math. 220 (2018)], our result yields a global stability result for Kerr de Sitter from Cauchy data on a spacelike hypersurface bridging two black hole exteriors.</description>

      <title>The Cyclic and Modular Microcosm Principle in Quantum Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monoidal categories with additional structure such as a braiding or some form of duality abound in quantum topology. They often appear in tandem with Frobenius algebras inside them. Motivations for this range from the theory of module categories to the construction of correlators in conformal field theory. We generalize the Baez-Dolan microcosm principle to consistently describe all these types of algebras by extending it to cyclic and modular algebras in the sense of Getzler-Kapranov. Our main result links the microcosm principle for cyclic algebras to the one for modular algebras via Costello's modular envelope. The result can be understood as a local-to-global construction for various flavors of Frobenius algebras that substantially generalizes and unifies the available, and often intrinsically semisimple methods using for example triangulations, state-sum constructions or skein theory. Several applications of the main result in conformal field theory are presented: We classify consistent systems of correlators for open conformal field theories and show that the genus zero correlators for logarithmic conformal field theories constructed by Fuchs-Schweigert can be uniquely extended to handlebodies. This establishes a very general correspondence between full genus zero conformal field theory in dimension two and skein theory in dimension three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for understanding symmetries in topological phases in 2+1 dimensions using the string-net model, encompassing both gauge symmetries that preserve anyon species and global symmetries permuting anyon species, including both invertible symmetries describable by groups and noninvertible symmetries described by categories. As an archetypal example, we reveal the first noninvertible categorical gauge symmetry of topological orders in 2+1 dimensions: the Fibonacci gauge symmetry of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, described by the Fibonacci fusion 2-category. Our approach involves two steps: first, establishing duality between different string-net models with Morita equivalent input fusion categories that describe the same topological order; and second, constructing symmetry transformations within the same string-net model when the dual models have isomorphic input fusion categories, achieved by composing duality maps with isomorphisms of degrees of freedom between the dual models.</description>

Abstract: We show that one dimensional non-stationary Schr\"odi-nger equation with a specific choice of potential reduces to the quantum Painlev\'e II equation and the solution of its Riccati form appears as a dominant term of that potential. Further, we show that Painlev\'e II Riccati solution is an equivalent representation of centrifugal expression of radial Schr\"odinger potential. This expression is used to derive the approximated form of the Yukawa potential of radial Schr\"odinger equation which can be solved by applying the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Finally, we express the approximated form of Yukawa potential explicitly in terms of qunatume Painlev\'e II solution.</description>

Abstract: We discuss some new aspects of the theory of the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno tau function which have come to light within the recent developments in the global asymptotic analysis of the tau functions related to the Painlev\'e equations. Specifically, we show that up to the total differentials the logarithmic derivatives of the Painlev\'e tau functions coincide with the corresponding classical action differential. This fact simplifies considerably the evaluation of the constant factors in the asymptotics of tau-functions, which has been a long-standing problem of the asymptotic theory of Painlev\'e equations. Furthermore, we believe that this observation is yet another manifestation of L. D. Faddeev's emphasis of the key role which the Hamiltonian aspects play in the theory of integrable system.

Abstract: The central object of the quantum algebraic approach to the study of quantum integrable models is the universal $R$-matrix, which is an element of a completed tensor product of two copies of quantum algebra. Various integrability objects are constructed by choosing representations for the factors of this tensor product. There are two approaches to constructing explicit expressions for the universal $R$-matrix. One is based on the quantum double construction, and the other is based on the concept of the $q$-commutator. In the case of a quantum superalgebra, we cannot use the first approach, since we do not know an explicit expression for the Lusztig automorphisms. One can use the second approach, but it requires some modifications related to the presence of isotropic roots. In this article, we provide the necessary modification of the method and use it to find an $R$-operator for quantum integrable systems related to the quantum superalgebra $\mathrm U_q(\mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{sl}_{M | N}))$.</description>

We derive an integral representation for the Dirac propagator involving the solutions of the ordinary differential equations which arise in the separation of variables. Our integral representation describes the dynamics of Dirac particles outside and across the event horizon, up to the Cauchy horizon.</description>

Abstract: We construct a $P(\phi)_2$ Gibbs state on infinite volume periodic surfaces (namely, with discrete ``time translations'') by analogy with 1-dimensional spin chains and establish the mass gap for our Gibbs state, there are no phase transitions. We also derive asymptotic properties of the $P(\phi)_2$ partition function on certain towers of cyclic covers of large degrees that converge to the periodic surface in some appropriate sense. This gives the first construction of an interacting Quantum Field Theory on surfaces of infinite genus with a mass gap. The main ingredient in our approach is to reconcile the so-called $P(\phi)_2$ model from classical constructive quantum field theory (CQFT) with Riemannian version of the axioms proposed by G. Segal in the 90's. We show the $P(\phi)_2$ model satisfies these axioms, appropriately adjusted. One key ingredient in our proof is to use what we call ``the Bayes principle'' of conditional probabilities in the infinite dimensional setting. We also give a precise statement and full proof of the locality of the $P(\phi)_2$ interaction.</description>

      <title>On tensors of factorizable quantum channels with the completely depolarizing channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:1803.10446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain results for factorizability of quantum channels. Firstly, we prove that if a tensor $T\otimes S_k$ of a quantum channel $T$ on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ with the completely depolarizing channel $S_k$ is written as a convex combination of automorphisms on the matrix algebra $M_n(\mathbb{C})\otimes M_k(\mathbb{C})$ with rational coefficients, then the quantum channel $T$ has an exact factorization through some matrix algebra with the normalized trace. Next, we prove that if a quantum channel has an exact factorization through a finite dimensional von Neumann algebra with a convex combination of normal faithful tracial states with rational coefficients, then it also has an exact factorization through some matrix algebra with the normalized trace.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional conformal field theory, full vertex algebra and current-current deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is a mathematical construction of a non-perturbative deformation of a two-dimensional conformal field theory. We introduce a notion of a full vertex algebra which formulates a compact two-dimensional conformal field theory. Then, we construct a deformation family of a full vertex algebra which serves as a current-current deformation of conformal field theory in physics. The parameter space of the deformation is expressed as a double coset of an orthogonal group, a quotient of an orthogonal Grassmannian. As an application, we consider a deformation of chiral conformal field theories, vertex operator algebras. A current-current deformation of a "vertex operator algebra" may produce new vertex operator algebras. We give a formula for counting the number of the isomorphic classes of vertex operator algebras obtained in this way. We demonstrate it for some holomorphic vertex operator algebra of central charge $24$.</description>

Abstract: We describe the tropical curves in toric varieties and define the tropical Gromov-Witten invariants. We introduce amplitudes for the higher topological quantum mechanics (HTQM) on special trees and show that the amplitudes are equal to the tropical Gromov-Witten invariants. We show that the sum over the amplitudes in $A$-model HTQM equals the total amplitude in B-model HTQM, defined as a deformation of the $A$-model HTQM by the mirror superpotential. We derived the mirror superpotentials for the toric varieties and showed that they coincide with the superpotentials in the mirror Landau-Ginzburg theory. We construct the mirror dual states to the evaluation observables in the tropical Gromov-Witten theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal blocks, physical quantities of chiral 2d conformal field theory, are sheaves on the configuration spaces of the complex plane, which are mathematically formulated in terms of a vertex operator algebra, its modules and associated D-modules. We show that the operad of fundamental groupoids of the configuration spaces, the parenthesized braid operad, acts on the conformal blocks by the monodromy representation.
  More precisely, let $V$ be a vertex operator algebra with $V=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} V_n$, $\dim V_n &lt;\infty$, $V_0=\mathbb{C}\bf{1}$ and $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ the category of $V$-modules $M$ such that $M$ is $C_1$-cofinite and the dual module $M^\vee$ is a finitely generated $V$-module. We show that the parenthesized braid operad weakly 2-categorically acts on $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$, and consequently $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ has a structure of the (unital) pseudo-braided category. Moreover, if $V$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite, then $V\text{-mod}_{\mathrm{f.g}}$ is a balanced braided tensor category, which gives an alternative proof of a result of Huang and Lepowsky.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of $q$-Painlev\'e VI with generic parameter values, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence induces a one-to-one mapping between solutions of the nonlinear equation and points on an affine Segre surface. Upon fixing a generic point on the surface, we give formulae for the function values of the corresponding solution near the critical points, in the form of complete, convergent, asymptotic expansions. These lead in particular to the solution of the nonlinear connection problem for the general solution of $q$-Painlev\'e VI. We further show that, when the point on the Segre surface is moved to one of the sixteen lines on the surface, one of the asymptotic expansions near the critical points truncates, under suitable parameter assumptions. At intersection points of lines, this then yields doubly truncated asymptotics at one of the critical points or simultaneous truncation at both.</description>

      <title>Topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in higher dimensions and uniform spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is an iconic phenomenon characterized by the aggregation of eigenstates near the system boundaries in non-Hermitian systems. While extensively studied in one dimension, understanding the skin effect and extending the non-Bloch band theory to higher dimensions encounters a formidable challenge, primarily due to infinite lattice geometries or open boundary conditions. This work adopts a point-gap perspective and unveils that non-Hermitian skin effect in all spatial dimensions originates from point gaps. We introduce the concept of uniform spectra and reveal that regardless of lattice geometry, their energy spectra are universally given by the uniform spectra, even though their manifestations of skin modes may differ. Building on the uniform spectra, we demonstrate how to account for the skin effect with generic lattice cuts and establish the connections of skin modes across different geometric shapes via momentum-basis transformations. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles point gaps play, offering a unified understanding of the topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in all dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a formulation of the Brans-Dicke theory in Jordan's frame for Bianchi-I spacetime within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The robustness of singularity resolutions due to the quantum effects is explicitly verified in the context of two quantization schemes typically used in the literature. We present an exploration of the effects of quantum geometry on the background dynamics, which is also illustrated through some explicit numerical examples and showing the absence of the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the heat kernel coefficients that are needed for the regularization and renormalization of massive gravity. Starting from the Stueckelberg action for massive gravity, we determine the propagators of the different fields (massive tensor, vector and scalar) in a general linear covariant gauge depending on four free gauge parameters. We then compute the non-minimal heat kernel coefficients for all the components of the scalar, vector and tensor sector, and employ these coefficients to regularize the propagators of all the different fields of massive gravity. We also study the massless limit and discuss the appearance of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity. In the course of the computation, we derive new identities relating the heat kernel coefficients of different field sectors, both massive and massless.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the self-adjointness of the two dimensional Dirac operator with infinite mass boundary conditions on an unbounded domain with an infinite number of corners. We prove that if the domain has no concave corners, then the operator is self-adjoint. On the other hand, when concave corners are present, the operator is no longer self-adjoint and self-adjoint extensions can be constructed. Among these, we characterize the distinguished extension as the unique one whose domain is included in the Sobolev space $H^{s}$, where $s&gt;1/2$ depends on the amplitude of the corners. Lastly, we study the spectrum of this distinguished self-adjoint extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the crossing map, a closed linear map acting on operators on the tensor square of a given Hilbert space that is inspired by the crossing property of quantum field theory. This map turns out to be closely connected to Tomita--Takesaki modular theory. In particular, crossing symmetric operators, namely those operators that are mapped to their adjoints by the crossing map, define endomorphisms of standard subspaces. Conversely, such endomorphisms can be integrated to crossing symmetric operators. We also investigate the relation between crossing symmetry and natural compatibility conditions with respect to unitary representations of certain symmetry groups, and furthermore introduce a generalized crossing map defined by a real object in an abstract $C^*$-tensor category, not necessarily consisting of Hilbert spaces and linear maps. This latter crossing map turns out to be closely related to the (unshaded, finite-index) subfactor theoretical Fourier transform. Lastly, we provide families of solutions of the crossing symmetry equation, solving in addition the categorical Yang--Baxter equation, associated with an arbitrary Q-system.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Underdamped Systems: An Analytic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal control theory deals with finding protocols to steer a system between assigned initial and final states, such that a trajectory-dependent cost function is minimized. The application of optimal control to stochastic systems is an open and challenging research frontier, with a spectrum of applications ranging from stochastic thermodynamics to biophysics and data science. Among these, the design of nanoscale electronic components motivates the study of underdamped dynamics.
  In this work, we develop analytic techniques to determine protocols steering finite time transitions at a minimum thermodynamic cost for stochastic underdamped dynamics. As cost functions, we consider two paradigmatic thermodynamic indicators. The first is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability measure of the controlled process and that of a reference process. The corresponding optimization problem is the underdamped version of the Schr\"odinger diffusion problem that has been widely studied in the overdamped regime. The second is the mean entropy production during the transition, corresponding to the second law of modern stochastic thermodynamics. For transitions between Gaussian states, we show that optimal protocols satisfy a Lyapunov equation, a central tool in stability analysis of dynamical systems. For transitions between states described by general Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, we introduce an infinite-dimensional version of the Poincar\'e-Linstedt multiscale perturbation theory around the overdamped limit. This technique fundamentally improves the standard multiscale expansion. Indeed, it enables the explicit computation of momentum cumulants, whose variation in time is a distinctive trait of underdamped dynamics and is directly accessible to experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We will establish (paying particular attention to large, or small, ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansions terms as linear combinations, with rational polynomial coefficients, of higher order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$. With a proper parametrization, the expansions in the Gaussian cases can be understood, for given $n$, as the limit $p\to\infty$ of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focussing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with large sample sizes.</description>

Abstract: We construct an integrable sigma model with a generalized $\mathcal{F}$ structure, which involves a generalized Nijenhuis structure $\mathcal{J}$ satisfying $\mathcal{J}^{3}=-\mathcal{J}$. Utilizing the expression of the generalized complex structure on the metric Lie group manifold $G$ in terms of operator relations on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we formulate a Yang-Baxter sigma model with a generalized complex structure. Additionally, we present multi-Yang-Baxter sigma models featuring two and three compatible Nijenhuis structures. Examples for each of these models are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some of the properties of the $G \to 0$ limit of the Kerr-Newman solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations. Noting Carter's observation of the near equality between the $g = 2$ gyromagnetic ratio in the Kerr-Newman solution and that of the electron, we discuss additional such coincidences relating to the Kerr-Newman multipoles and properties of the electron. In contrast to the Coulomb field, this spinning Maxwell field has a finite Lagrangian. Moreover, by evaluating the Lagrangian for the superposition of two such Kerr-Newman electromagnetic fields on a flat background, we are able to find their interaction potential. This yields a correction to the Coulomb interaction due to the spin of the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal theory of instabilities in swirling flows, occurring in both natural settings and industrial applications, is formulated. The theory encompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral isothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients and natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local analysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations and linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general criterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both centrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking into account viscosity and thermal diffusion and guiding experimental and numerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

Abstract: In this article we propose a numerical algorithm to compute the intensity and polarization of a polychromatic electromagnetic radiation crossing a medium with graded refractive index and modeled by the Vector Radiative Refractive Transfer Equations (VRRTE). Special attention is given to the case where the refractive index has a discontinuity for which the Fresnel conditions are necessary. We assume that the only spatial variable of interest is the altitude (stratified medium). An algorithm based on iterations of the sources is shown to be monotone and convergent. Numerical examples are given with highly varying absorption coefficient kappa and Rayleigh scattering as in the Earth atmosphere. To study the effect of CO2 in the atmosphere kappa is changed in the frequency ranges where CO2 is absorbing.</description>

      <title>Riesz means asymptotics for Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary and prove two-term asymptotics for their Riesz means of arbitrary positive order. Moreover, when the underlying domain is convex, we obtain universal, non-asymptotic bounds that correctly reproduce the two leading terms in the asymptotics and depend on the domain only through simple geometric characteristics. An important ingredient in the proof of the latter result is a pointwise bound for the heat kernel of the Neumann Laplacian in a convex domain with universal constants. Additional ingredients in our proof are non-asymptotic versions of various Tauberian theorems.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional inverse acoustic scattering problem by the BC-method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The forward acoustic scattering problem is to find $u=u^f(x,t)$ satisfying \begin{align*} &amp;u_{tt}-\Delta u+qu=0, &amp;&amp; (x,t) \in {\mathbb R}^3 \times (-\infty,\infty); \\ &amp;u \mid_{|x|&lt;-t} =0 , &amp;&amp; t&lt;0;\\ &amp;\lim_{s \to -\infty} s\,u((-s+\tau)\,\omega,s)=f(\tau,\omega), &amp;&amp; (\tau,\omega) \in \Sigma:=[0,\infty)\times S^2; \end{align*} for a real valued compactly supported potential $q=q(x)$ and a control $f \in L_2(\Sigma)$. The map $R: L_2(\Sigma)\to L_2(\Sigma)$, \begin{align*} &amp; (Rf)(\tau ,\omega )\,:= \lim_{s \to +\infty} s\, u^f((s+\tau )\,\omega ,s), \quad (\tau ,\omega ) \in \Sigma \end{align*} is a response operator.
  The inverse problem is to determine $q$ from $R$. It is solved by a relevant version of the boundary control method. The procedure that recovers the potential is local: for any fixed $\xi&gt;0$, given $R\upharpoonright\{f\in L_2(\Sigma)\,|\,\,f\mid_{0\leqslant \tau&lt;\xi}=0\}$ it determines $q\big|_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$.</description>
