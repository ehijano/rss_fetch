      <title>A predator-prey model with age-structured role reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a predator-prey model with an age-structured predator population that exhibits a functional role reversal. The structure of the predator population in our model embodies the ecological concept of an "ontogenetic niche shift", in which a species' functional role changes as it grows. This structure adds complexity to our model but increases its biological relevance. The time evolution of the age-structured predator population is motivated by the Kermack-McKendrick Renewal Equation (KMRE). Unlike KMRE, the predator population's birth and death rate functions depend on the prey population's size. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the solutions to the proposed model's initial value problem. The dynamical properties of the proposed model are investigated via Latin Hypercube Sampling in the 15-dimensional space of its parameters. Our Linear Discriminant Analysis suggests that the most influential parameters are the maturation age of the predator and the rate of consumption of juvenile predators by the prey. We carry out a detailed study of the long-term behavior of the proposed model as a function of these two parameters. In addition, we reduce the proposed age-structured model to ordinary and delayed differential equation (ODE and DDE) models. The comparison of the long-term behavior of the ODE, DDE, and the age-structured models with matching parameter settings shows that the age structure promotes the instability of the Coexistence Equilibrium and the emergence of the Coexistence Periodic Attractor.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector-Based Sensitivity Analysis of Contact Patterns in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how age-specific social contact patterns and susceptibility influence infectious disease transmission is crucial for accurate epidemic modeling. This study presents an eigenvector-based sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the impact of age-structured interactions on disease spread. By applying perturbation analysis to the Next Generation Matrix, we reformulate the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, as a generalized eigenproblem, enabling the identification of key age group interactions that drive transmission. Using real-world COVID-19 contact data from Hungary, we demonstrate the framework's ability to highlight critical transmission pathways. We compare these findings with results obtained earlier using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we extend the analysis to contact structures in the UK and British Columbia, Canada, providing broader epidemiological insights. This work enhances our understanding of demographic interactions in epidemic propagation and offers a robust methodological foundation for improving infectious disease modeling and informing public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of parsimony under the multispecies coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is known that parsimony can be statistically inconsistent under certain models of evolution due to high levels of homoplasy, the consistency of parsimony under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) is less well studied. Previous studies have shown the consistency of concatenated parsimony (parsimony applied to concatenated alignments) under the MSC for the rooted 4-taxa case under an infinite-sites model of mutation; on the other hand, other work has also established the inconsistency of concatenated parsimony for the unrooted 6-taxa case. These seemingly contradictory results suggest that concatenated parsimony may fail to be consistent for trees with more than 5 taxa, for all unrooted trees, or for some combination of the two. Here, we present a technique for computing the expected internal branch lengths of gene trees under the MSC. This technique allows us to determine the regions of the parameter space of the species tree under which concatenated parsimony fails for different numbers of taxa, for rooted or unrooted trees. We use our new approach to demonstrate that while parsimony succeeds in the unrooted 5-taxa case, there are regions of statistical inconsistency for concatenated parsimony for rooted 5+-taxa cases and unrooted 6+-taxa cases. Our results therefore suggest that parsimony is not generally dependable under the MSC.</description>

      <title>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</description>
