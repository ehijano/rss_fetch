      <title>Bridging Microscopic Dynamics and Hydraulic Permeability in Mechanically-Deformed Nanoporous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of nanoconfined fluids, there are striking examples of deformation/transport coupling in which mechanical solicitation of the confining host and dynamics of the confined fluid impact each other. While this intriguing behavior can be potentially used for practical applications (e.g. energy storage, phase separation, catalysis), the underlying mechanisms remain to be understood as they challenge existing frameworks. Here, using molecular simulations analyzed through concepts inherent to interfacial fluids, we investigate fluid flow in compliant nanoporous materials subjected to external mechanical stresses. We show that the pore mechanical properties significantly affect fluid flow as they lead to significant pore deformations and different density layering at the interface accounted for by invoking interfacial viscous effects. Despite such poromechanical effects, we show that the thermodynamic properties (i.e. adsorption) can be linked consistently to Darcy's law for the permeability by invoking a pore size definition based on the concept of Gibbs' dividing surface. In particular, regardless of the pore stiffness and applied external stress, all data can be rationalized by accounting for the fluid viscosity and slippage at the interface independent of a specific pore size definition. Using such a formalism, we establish that the intimate relation - derived using the linear response theory - between collective diffusivity and hydraulic permeability remains valid. This allows for linking consistently microscopic dynamics experiments and permeability experiments on fluid flow in compliant nanoporous materials.</description>

      <title>A generalized approach for rapid entropy calculation of liquids and solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a comprehensive methodology for the fast computation of entropy across both solid and liquid phases. The proposed method utilizes a single trajectory of molecular dynamics (MD) to facilitate the calculation of entropy, which is composed of three components. The electronic entropy is determined through the temporal average acquired from density functional theory (DFT) MD simulations. The vibrational entropy, typically the predominant contributor to the total entropy, even within the liquid state, is evaluated by computing the phonon density of states via the velocity auto-correlation function. The most arduous component to quantify, the configurational entropy, is assessed by probability analysis of the local structural arrangement and atomic distribution. We illustrate, through a variety of examples, that this method is both a versatile and valid technique for characterizing the thermodynamic states of both solids and liquids. Furthermore, this method is employed to expedite the calculation of melting temperatures, demonstrating its practical utility in computational thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>From cell intercalation to flow, the importance of T1 transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of epithelial monolayers, T1 transitions, also known as cell-intercalations, are topological rearrangements of cells that contribute to fluidity of the epithelial monolayers. We use a multi-phase field model to show that the ensemble-averaged flow profile of a T1 transition exhibits a saddle point structure, where large velocities are localised near cells undergoing T1 transitions, contributing to vortical flow. This tissue fluidisation corresponds to the dispersion of cells relative to each other. While the temporal evolution of the mean pair-separation distance between initially neighbouring cells depends on specific model details, the mean pair-separation distance increases linearly with the number of T1 transitions, in a way that is robust to model parameters.</description>

      <title>Associative memory by virtual oscillator network based on single spin-torque oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coupled oscillator network may be able to perform an energy-efficient associative memory operation. However, its realization has been difficult because inhomogeneities unavoidably arise among the oscillators during fabrication and lead to an unreliable operation. This issue could be resolved if the oscillator network were able to be formed from a single oscillator. Here, we performed numerical simulations and theoretical analyses on an associative memory operation that uses a virtual oscillator network based on a spin-torque oscillator. The virtual network combines the concept of coupled oscillators with that of feedforward neural networks. Numerical experiments demonstrate successful associations of $60$-pixel patterns with various memorized patterns. Moreover, the origin of the associative memory is shown to be forced synchronization driven by feedforward input, where phase differences among oscillators are fixed and correspond to the colors of the pixels in the pattern.</description>

      <title>Phonon pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent studies, it has been discovered that phonons can carry angular momentum, leading to a series of investigations into systems with 3-fold rotation symmetry. However, for systems with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry, such as $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, there has been no relevant discussion. In this paper, we investigated the pseudoangular momentum of phonons in crystals with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry. Taking $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ as an example, we explain the selection rules in circularly polarized Raman experiments resulting from pseudoangular momentum conservation, providing important guidance for experiments. This study of pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ opens up a new degree of freedom for its potential applications, expanding into new application domains.</description>
