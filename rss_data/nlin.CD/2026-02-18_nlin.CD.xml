      <title>Spinning compact object and chaos in galactic centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic centres are highly dynamic regions dominated by a supermassive black hole (BH) surrounded by nuclear star clusters (NSC), molecular gas, and asymmetric matter distributions such as disks or halos. The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families. These findings enhance our understanding of how relativistic spin effects and multipolar mass distributions jointly govern the dynamical architecture of galactic centers.</description>

      <title>Coupled Map Lattice for Astronomical Object Formation: A Scenario for Evolution from Star to Disk, Arms, and Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new dynamic formation model of a star, a disk, arms, and companions using a coupled map lattice (CML), a complex systems approach. This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star "starring" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called "arm-crossing companion formation" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.</description>

      <title>Global phase-space geometry of three-dimensional gliding: terminal velocity manifolds, separatrices, and stability structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a three-dimensional dynamical-systems framework for passive gliding and identify the global phase-space structures that organize its motion. Extending previous two-dimensional models of non-equilibrium gliding, we show that the 3D velocity dynamics possess an attracting, normally hyperbolic invariant surface, the terminal velocity manifold (TVM), onto which all trajectories rapidly collapse before evolving slowly toward a glide equilibrium. There is also a separatrix surface associated with an invariant manifold of an unstable equilibrium within the TVM, which partitions initial conditions into qualitatively distinct descent behaviors: efficient shallow glides versus steep, drag-dominated descent. Using lift-drag data from three representative airfoils--a snake-inspired bluff body, the Zimmerman planform characteristic of Draco lizards, and the classical NACA 0012--we compute the full equilibrium surfaces, analyze their pitch-roll bifurcations, and reconstruct the TVM and separatrix geometry in three dimensions. The results reveal that (i) equilibrium stability changes with both pitch and roll, rather than pitch alone; (ii) separatrix geometry determines the dynamic accessibility of shallow glides; and (iii) bio-inspired airfoils possess compact separatrix regions that make efficient gliding robust across a wide range of initial jump conditions. This work unifies biological and engineered gliders within a single global geometric framework and establishes separatrix geometry on the TVM as a principled diagnostic for glide robustness.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model: a review and open problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review provides an up-to-date account of energy transport in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) chains, a key testbed for nonequilibrium statistical physics. We discuss the transition from the historical puzzle of thermalization to the discovery of anomalous heat transport, where the effective thermal conductivity $\kappa$ diverges with system size $L$ as $\kappa \propto L^\delta$. The article clarifies the distinction between two universality classes: the FPUT-$\alpha \beta$ model, characterized by $\delta = 1/3$ and linked to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics, and the symmetric FPUT-$\beta$ model, where numerical and theoretical evidence support $\delta = 2/5$. We investigate how finite-size effects - unavoidably induced by the thermostatting protocols - can disguise the asymptotic scaling. Additionally, we analyze the role of conservative noise in preserving hydrodynamic properties and examine how proximity to integrable limits leads to long-lived quasi-particles and, thereby, to diffusive regimes over intermediate spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium statistical mechanics of waves in inhomogeneous moving media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt the microcanonical framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics to predict the statistics of short waves in inhomogeneous moving media. For steady inhomogeneities and background flow, we compute the wave spectrum at any location in the domain based on an ergodic prescription for the action density in phase space, constrained by conservation of absolute frequency. We illustrate the method for shallow-water waves subject to a background flow or to topographic inhomogeneities, and for deep-water surface capillary waves over a background flow, validating the predicted maps of rms surface elevation and interfacial slope against numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Analog-based ensembles to characterize turbulent dynamics from observed data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a methodology for the study of the dispersion of trajectories of stochastic processes in reconstructed phase spaces from observed data. The methodology allows to find ensembles of analog states, i.e. states that are close in the phase space. Once these states are found, we focus on the characterisation of their dispersion in function of 1) the time and 2) their initial separation. We study an experimental turbulent velocity measurement and two scale-invariant stochastic processes: a regularized fractional Brownian motion and a regularized multifractal random walk. Both stochastic processes are synthesized to have the same covariance structure as the experimental turbulent velocity, but only the regularized multifractal random walk mimics the intermittency of turbulent velocity. We illustrate that while the covariance structure of the processes governs the time dependence of the dispersion of the analog states, the intermittency phenomenon is responsible for the impact of the initial separation of the analogs on their dispersion.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector Geometry as a New Route to Criticality in Random Multiplicative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed fluctuations and power law distributions pervade physics, biology, and the social sciences, with numerous mechanisms proposed for their emergence. Kesten processes, which are multiplicative stochastic recursions with additive noise or reinjection, provide a canonical explanation, where power law tails arise from transient supercritical excursions as eigenvalues intermittently cross the stability boundary. Here we uncover a distinct and more general mechanism in multidimensional systems: non-normal eigenvector amplification. In random non-normal matrices, the non-orthogonality of eigenvectors, quantified at each time step by the condition number $\kappa_t$ in Kesten-like processes, induces transient growth that increases the effective Lyapunov exponent $\gamma \to \gamma + \mathbb{E}\left[\ln \kappa_t \right]$ and lowers the tail exponent $\alpha \simeq -2\gamma / \sigma_{\kappa}^2$, where $\mathbb{E}\left[\ln \kappa_t \right]$ and $\sigma_{\kappa}^2$ are respectively the mean and variance of $\ln \kappa_t$. As the system dimension $N$ grows, $\kappa$ typically increases proportionally, making non-normal amplification the dominant source of scale-free behavior. We illustrate this mechanism in polymer stretching in turbulent flows, where intermittent extensions arise from eigenvector amplification of velocity gradients.</description>

      <title>Chaotic discretization theorems for forced linear and nonlinear coupled oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the holding of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke for a family of four-dimensional discrete dynamical systems that are naturally associated to ODE systems describing coupled oscillators subject to an external non-conservative force, also giving an example of a discrete map that is Li-Yorke chaotic but not topologically transitive. Analytical results are generalized to a modular definition of the problem and to a system of nonlinear oscillators described by polynomial potentials in one coordinate. We perform numerical simulations looking for a strange attractor of the system; furthermore, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the system presenting 1D and 2D bifurcation diagrams, together with spectra of Lyapunov exponents and basins of attraction.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic versus relativistic quantum scars in billiard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the features of scarred eigenstates of relativistic neutrino billiards (NBs), graphene billiards (GBs) and Haldane graphene billiards (HGBs) and recapitulate those for nonrelativistic quantum billiards (QBs) with the shapes of a full- and quarter-stadium billiard. Here, we restrict for the GBs and HGBs to the region of linear dispersion around the Fermi energy, where they are effectively described by the same Dirac equation for massless spin-1/2 particles as NBs. Scarred wave functions of the nonrelativistic billiards and spinor functions of the relativistic ones are localized along the same types of periodic orbits, the most prominent ones being bouncing-ball orbits. The objective is to demonstrate that the properties of the scarred eigenstates observed in the full- and quarter-stadium GB do not comply with those of relativistic quantum systems. For this we apply the semiclassical approach associated with such non-generic contributions, which was developed for the spectral density of QBs and NBs. It provides semiclassical trace formulas in terms of the periodic orbits associated with a scarred wave function and a procedure to extract such contributions from the eigenvalue spectra. Furthermore, we analyze momentum distributions and Husimi functions of such scarred states and employ them to classify scarred wave functions according to the periodic orbits along which they are localized. We show that for the GB the semiclassical approach, the spectral properties, the symmetry properties and generally properties of the wave functions all comply with those of the nonrelativistic QB, whereas for the HGB they agree well with those of the NB, implying that the quantum scars observed in GBs are not relativistic.</description>

      <title>Causally constrained reduced-order neural models of complex turbulent dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible framework based on response theory and score matching to suppress spurious, noncausal dependencies in reduced-order neural emulators of turbulent systems, focusing on climate dynamics as a proof-of-concept. We showcase the approach using the stochastic Charney-DeVore model as a relevant prototype for low-frequency atmospheric variability. We show that the resulting causal constraints enhance neural emulators' ability to respond to both weak and strong external forcings, despite being trained exclusively on unforced data. The approach is broadly applicable to modeling complex turbulent dynamical systems in reduced spaces and can be readily integrated into general neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description>
