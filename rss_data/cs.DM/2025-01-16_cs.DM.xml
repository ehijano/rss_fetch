      <title>On the generalized coloring numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{coloring number} $\mathrm{col}(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is equal to the \emph{degeneracy} of $G$ plus one, provides a very useful measure for the uniform sparsity of $G$. The coloring number is generalized by three series of measures, the \emph{generalized coloring numbers}. These are the \emph{$r$-admissibility} $\mathrm{adm}_r(G)$, the \emph{strong $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{col}_r(G)$ and the \emph{weak $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)$, where $r$ is an integer parameter. The generalized coloring numbers measure the edge density of bounded-depth minors and thereby provide an even more uniform measure of sparsity of graphs. They have found many applications in graph theory and in particular play a key role in the theory of bounded expansion and nowhere dense graph classes introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. We overview combinatorial and algorithmic applications of the generalized coloring numbers, emphasizing new developments in this area. We also present a simple proof for the existence of uniform orders and improve known bounds, e.g., for the weak coloring numbers on graphs with excluded topological minors.</description>

      <title>Profile and neighbourhood complexity of graphs with excluded minors and tree-structured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $r$-neighbourhood complexity of a graph $G$ is the function counting, for a given integer $k$, the largest possible number, over all vertex-subsets $A$ of size $k$, of subsets of $A$ realized as the intersection between the $r$-neighbourhood of some vertex and $A$. A refinement of this notion is the $r$-profile complexity, that counts the maximum number of distinct distance-vectors from any vertex to the vertices of $A$, ignoring distances larger than $r$. Typically, in structured graph classes such as graphs of bounded VC-dimension or chordal graphs, these functions are bounded, leading to insights into their structural properties and efficient algorithms.
  We improve existing bounds on the $r$-profile complexity (and thus on the $r$-neighbourhood complexity) for graphs in several structured graph classes. We show that the $r$-profile complexity of graphs excluding $K_h$ as a minor is in $O_h(r^{3h-3}k)$. For graphs of treewidth at most $t$ we give a bound in $O_t(r^{t+1}k)$, which is tight up to a function of $t$ as a factor. These bounds improve results and answer a question of Joret and Rambaud [Combinatorica, 2024].
  For outerplanar graphs, we can improve our treewidth bound by a factor of $r$ and conjecture that a similar improvement holds for graphs with bounded simple treewidth. For graphs of treelength at most $\ell$, we give the upper bound in $O(k(r^2(\ell+1)^k))$.
  Our bounds also imply relations between the order, diameter and metric dimension of graphs in these classes, improving results from [Beaudou et al., SIDMA 2017].</description>

      <title>A stochastic programming approach for the scheduling of medical interpreting service under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited English Proficiency (LEP) patients face higher risks of adverse health outcomes due to communication barriers, making timely medical interpreting services essential for mitigating those risks. This paper addresses the scheduling of medical interpreting services under uncertainty. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model that accounts for uncertainties in emergency patients' arrival and service time. The model handles the hiring decisions of part-time interpreters and the assignment of full-time and hired part-time interpreters. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which encompasses full-time interpreters' overtime cost, the fixed and variable costs of part-time interpreters, and the penalty cost for not serving LEP patients on time. The model is solved using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) algorithm. To overcome the computational burden of the SAA algorithm, a Tabu Search (TS) algorithm was used to solve the model. A real-life case study is used to validate and evaluate the proposed solution algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic programming-based solutions in concurrently reducing both the total cost and the waiting time. Further, sensitivity analysis reveals how the increase in some key parameters, such as the arrival rate of emergency patients with LEP, impacts scheduling outcomes.</description>

      <title>Matching Cut and Variants on Bipartite Graphs of Bounded Radius and Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Matching Cut problem we ask whether a graph $G$ has a matching cut, that is, a matching which is also an edge cut of $G$. We consider the variants Perfect Matching Cut and Disconnected Perfect Matching where we ask whether there exists a matching cut equal to, respectively contained in, a perfect matching. Further, in the problem Maximum Matching Cut we ask for a matching cut with a maximum number of edges. The last problem we consider is $d$-Cut where we ask for an edge cut where each vertex is incident to at most $d$ edges in the cut.
  We investigate the computational complexity of these problems on bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter. Our results extend known results for Matching Cut and Disconnected Perfect Matching. We give complexity dichotomies for $d$-Cut and Maximum Matching Cut and solve one of two open cases for Disconnected Perfect Matching. For Perfect Matching Cut we give the first hardness result for bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter and extend the known polynomial cases.</description>

      <title>The Hurt-Sada Array and Zeckendorf Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wesley Ivan Hurt and Ali Sada both independently proposed studying an infinite array where the $0$'th row consists of the non-negative integers $0,1,2,\ldots$ in increasing order. Thereafter the $n$'th row is formed from the $(n-1)$'th row by "jumping" the single entry $n$ by $n$ places to the right. Sada also defined a sequence $s(n)$ defined to be the first number that $n$ jumps over. In this note I show how the Hurt-Sada array and Sada's sequence are intimately connected with the golden ratio $\varphi$ and Zeckendorf representation. I also consider a number of related sequences.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representation via Axis-Aligned Point-Subspace Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new representation of $k$-partite, $k$-uniform hypergraphs, that is, a hypergraph with a partition of vertices into $k$ parts such that each hyperedge contains exactly one vertex of each type; we call them $k$-hypergraphs for short. Given positive integers $\ell, d$, and $k$ with $\ell\leq d-1$ and $k={d\choose\ell}$, any finite set $P$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ represents a $k$-hypergraph $G_P$ as follows. Each point in $P$ is covered by $k$ many axis-aligned affine $\ell$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we call $\ell$-subspaces for brevity and which form the vertex set of $G_P$. We interpret each point in $P$ as a hyperedge of $G_P$ that contains each of the covering $\ell$-subspaces as a vertex. The class of \emph{$(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs} is the class of $k$-hypergraphs that can be represented in this way. The resulting classes of hypergraphs are fairly rich: Every $k$-hypergraph is a $(k,k-1)$-hypergraph. On the other hand, $(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs form a proper subclass of the class of all $k$-hypergraphs for $\ell&lt;d-1$.
  In this paper we give a natural structural characterization of $(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs based on vertex cuts. This characterization leads to a poly\-nomial-time recognition algorithm that decides for a given $k$-hypergraph whether or not it is a $(d,\ell)$-hypergraph and that computes a representation if existing. We assume that the dimension $d$ is constant and that the partitioning of the vertex set is prescribed.</description>

      <title>Multigraph edge-coloring with local list sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a multigraph and $L\,:\,E(G) \to 2^\mathbb{N}$ be a list assignment on the edges of $G$. Suppose additionally, for every vertex $x$, the edges incident to $x$ have at least $f(x)$ colors in common. We consider a variant of local edge-colorings wherein the color received by an edge $e$ must be contained in $L(e)$. The locality appears in the function $f$, i.e., $f(x)$ is some function of the local structure of $x$ in $G$. Such a notion is a natural generalization of traditional local edge-coloring. Our main results include sufficient conditions on the function $f$ to construct such colorings. As corollaries, we obtain local analogs of Vizing and Shannon's theorems, recovering a recent result of Conley, Greb\'ik and Pikhurko.</description>

      <title>Stable Set Polytopes with Rank $|V(G)|/3$ for the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytope of graphs with respect to the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$ applied to the fractional stable set polytope. In particular, we show that for every positive integer $\ell$, the smallest possible graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ contains $3\ell$ vertices. This result is sharp and settles a conjecture posed by Lipt\'{a}k and the second author in 2003, as well as answers a generalization of a problem posed by Knuth in 1994. We also show that for every positive integer $\ell$ there exists a vertex-transitive graph on $4\ell+12$ vertices with $\text{LS}_+$-rank at least $\ell$.</description>
