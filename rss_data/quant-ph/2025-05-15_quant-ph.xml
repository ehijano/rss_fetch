      <title>Thin Film Lithium Niobate on Diamond (LiNDa) platform for Efficient Spin-Phonon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamonds are leading candidates for solid-state quantum memories that can be controlled using electromagnetic or acoustic waves. The latter are particularly promising due to strong strain response of SiV, enabling large spin-phonon interaction strengths. Indeed, coherent spin control via surface acoustic waves (SAW) has been demonstrated and is essential for developing on-chip phononic quantum networks. However, the absence of piezoelectricity in diamond requires interfacing with a piezoelectric material for efficient transduction and delivery of acoustic waves to spins in diamonds. Here, we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated phononic platform that combines thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) with diamond to enable acoustic control of single SiV spins. Additionally, leveraging large SAW-induced strain at the location of SiV, we achieve coherent acoustic control of an electron spin with more than twofold improvement in Rabi frequency compared to the state-of-the-art devices based on aluminum nitride-on-diamond. This work represents a crucial step towards realizing phonon-based quantum information processing systems.</description>

      <title>When Recall Fails, Discord Remembers: A Quantum Analogue of Kuhn's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A behavioral quantum strategy is shown to replicate the payoff of a classical mixed strategy in an extensive-form game with imperfect recall, using only local measurements on a separable quantum state with zero entanglement and nonzero discord. Classical behavioral strategies, constrained by imperfect recall, cannot achieve this coordination. The result suggests a quantum analogue to Kuhn's classical equivalence: discord enables behavioral-style strategies to functionally substitute for strategic memory and recover coordination lost in the classical setting. This highlights quantum discord as a minimal and robust resource for extending bounded rationality beyond classical limits.</description>

      <title>TeleSABRE: Layout Synthesis in Multi-Core Quantum Systems with Teleport Interconnect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit compilation and, in particular, efficient qubit layout synthesis is a critical challenge in modular, multi-core quantum architectures with constrained interconnects. In this work, we extend the SABRE heuristic algorithm to develop TeleSABRE, a layout synthesis approach tailored for architectures featuring teleportation-based interconnects. Unlike standard SABRE, which only introduces SWAP operations for qubit movement, TeleSABRE integrates both intracore SWAPs and teleportation-based techniques leveraging qubit teleportation and gate teleportation across cores. This enables more efficient circuit execution by reducing both inter-core communication overhead and the number of intra-core SWAPs required to allow teleportation protocols and local gate executions. Experimental results demonstrate that TeleSABRE achieves 28% reduction across various benchmarks in terms of inter-core operations while also taking into account the logistics of the teleport protocols.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap Bounds for Quantum Markov Semigroups via Correlation Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from an arbitrary full-rank state of a lattice quantum spin system, we define a "canonical purified Hamiltonian" and characterize its spectral gap in terms of a spatial mixing condition (or correlation decay) of the state. When the state considered is a Gibbs state of a local, commuting Hamiltonian at positive temperature, we show that the spectral gap of the canonical purified Hamiltonian provides a lower bound to the spectral gap of a large class of reversible generators of quantum Markov semigroup, including local and ergodic Davies generators. As an application of our construction, we show that the mixing condition is always satisfied for any finite-range 1D model, as well as by Kitaev's quantum double models.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in frustrated Ising fullerenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex energy landscapes exhibited by frustrated magnetic systems undergoing quantum fluctuations are a challenge to accurately simulate, and thus of great interest for testing diverse qubit platforms in the field of quantum simulation. This study experimentally demonstrates quantum fluctuations lifting the degenerate ground-state manifold of classical magnetic configurations in fullerene Ising models with resonating dimers. The interplay between degeneracy and quantum fluctuations makes these boundary-free models a suitable benchmark for quantum simulators. Indeed, we observe significant performance improvement across generations of superconducting quantum annealers, showing the potential of highly symmetric, frustrated systems for assessing the precision of quantum-simulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Hardware-aware Compilation for Chip-to-Chip Coupler-Connected Modular Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum processors scale, monolithic architectures face growing challenges due to limited qubit density, heterogeneous error profiles, and restricted connectivity. Modular quantum systems, enabled by chip-to-chip coupler-connected modular architectures, provide a scalable alternative. However, existing quantum compilers fail to accommodate this new architecture. We introduce CCMap, a circuit-compiler co-design framework that enhances existing quantum compilers with system-level coordination across modular chips. It leverages calibration data and introduces a coupler-aligned and noise-aware cost metric to evaluate circuit compilation. CCMap integrates with existing compilers by partitioning circuits into subcircuits compiled on individual chips, followed by a global mapping step to minimize the total cost. We evaluated CCMap on IBM-Q noisy emulators using real hardware calibrations across various coupler-connected topologies. Results show that CCMap improves circuit fidelity by up to 21.9%, representing a 30% increase, and reduces compilation cost by up to 58.6% over state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight CCMap's potential to enable scalable, high-fidelity execution in coupler-connected modular quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete time quasi-crystal in Rydberg atomic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error-Corrected Computation of Molecular Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first demonstration of an end-to-end pipeline with quantum error correction (QEC) for a quantum computation of the electronic structure of molecular systems. Using Quantinuum H2-2, we calculate the ground-state energy of molecular hydrogen, using quantum phase estimation (QPE) on qubits encoded with the $[[7,1,3]]$ color code. To improve on the performance of the logical compilation of the QPE circuits into the Clifford+$T$ gate set, we introduce several partially fault-tolerant (FT) techniques for the Clifford+$R_{Z}$ (arbitrary-angle single-qubit rotation) gate set. To enhance computational fidelity, we integrate Steane QEC gadgets for real-time error correction, demonstrating measurable improvements in precision. The circuits used contain 22 qubits, and up to 2185 physical two-qubit gates and $760$ mid-circuit measurements. We observe that adding QEC gadgets in the middle of circuits improves the QPE circuits' performance despite the complexity of the extra QEC circuitry. The energy $E$ is experimentally estimated to within $E - E_{\mathrm{FCI}} = 0.018(10)$ hartree, where $E_{\mathrm{FCI}}$ denotes the exact ground state energy within the given basis set. Additionally, we conduct numerical simulations with tunable noise parameters to identify the dominant sources of noise. We find that orienting the QEC protocols towards higher memory noise protection is the most promising avenue to improve our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Optimal randomized measurements for a family of non-linear quantum properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum learning encounters fundamental challenges when estimating non-linear properties, owing to the inherent linearity of quantum mechanics. Although recent advances in single-copy randomized measurement protocols have achieved optimal sample complexity for specific tasks like state purity estimation, generalizing these protocols to estimate broader classes of non-linear properties without sacrificing optimality remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce the observable-driven randomized measurement (ORM) protocol enabling the estimation of ${\rm Tr}(O\rho^2)$ for an arbitrary observable $O$ -- an essential quantity in quantum computing and many-body physics. ORM achieves this by decomposing the observable $O$ into dichotomic observables and extracting the information of each eigenspace through randomized measurements with block-diagonal unitaries. We establish an upper bound for ORM's sample complexity and prove its optimality for all Pauli observables, closing a gap in the literature. Furthermore, we develop simplified variants of ORM for local Pauli observables and introduce a braiding randomized measurement protocol for fidelity estimation, both of which significantly reduce circuit complexities in practical applications. Numerical experiments validate that ORM requires substantially fewer state samples to achieve the same precision compared to classical shadows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study is motivated by a difficulty to reconcile between particle number conservation and superconductivity. An alternative modeling, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously ocuurs in quantum systems, is explored. The Fermi-Hubbard mode is employed to demonstrate a disentanglement-induced quantum phase transition into a state having a finite superconducting order parameter. Moreover, the effect of disentanglement on Josephson junction's current phase relation is explored.</description>

      <title>Experimental Frequency-Comb-Based Mode-Pairing Quantum Key Distribution Beyond the Rate-Loss Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode-pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) offers significant potential for long-distance secure communication, benefiting from its quadratic scaling capacity and phase compensation-free characteristic. However, MP-QKD still requires stringent wavelength consistency between remote lasers, which is impractical with commercial lasers without locking. In this work, we develop a simple optical-frequency-comb-based MP-QKD system to simultaneously establish coherence and distribute keys with free-running commercial lasers. We implement the experiment over standard single-mode fiber with a loss coefficient of 0.2 dB/km. The system achieves finite-size secret key rates (SKRs) of 561.26, 113.59, and 10.20 bits per second over 303.37, 354.62, and 404.25 km, which are 1.0267, 2.5230, and 2.1033 times of the rate-loss limit. Besides, the SKR over 202.31 km is 8695.34 bits per second, which is sufficient to support practical cryptographic applications. These results validate the practicality and robustness of our method, offering a simplified yet high-performance framework for long-distance secure communication.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Particle-in-Cell Method for Plasma Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method, where the electrostatic field Poisson solver is implemented on a quantum computer simulator using a hybrid classical-quantum Neural Network (HNN) using data-driven and physics-informed learning approaches. The HNN is trained on classical PIC simulation results and executed via a PennyLane quantum simulator. The remaining computational steps, including particle motion and field interpolation, are performed on a classical system. To evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of this hybrid approach, we test the hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic PIC against the two-stream instability, a standard benchmark in plasma physics. Our results show that the quantum Poisson solver achieves comparable accuracy to classical methods. It also provides insights into the feasibility of using quantum computing and HNNs for plasma simulations. We also discuss the computational overhead associated with current quantum computer simulators, showing the challenges and potential advantages of hybrid quantum-classical numerical methods.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Control of a Strongly Coupled Electro-Nuclear Spin-Photon Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long distance quantum networking requires combining efficient spin-photon interfaces with long-lived local memories. Group-IV color centers in diamond (SiV, GeV, and SnV) are promising candidates for this application, containing an electronic spin-photon interface and dopant nuclear spin memory. Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spin-photon coupling and spin-spin entanglement. However, coupling between the electron and nuclear spins introduces a phase kickback during optical excitation that limits the utility of the nuclear memory. Here, we propose using the large hyperfine coupling of SnV-117 to operate the device at zero magnetic field in a regime where the memory is insensitive to optical excitation. We further demonstrate ground state spin control of a SnV-117 color center integrated in a photonic integrated circuit, showing 97.8% gate fidelity and 2.5 ms coherence time for the memory spin level. This shows the viability of the zero-field protocol for high fidelity operation, and lays the groundwork for building quantum network nodes with SnV-117 devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversion of a quantum state from a flying qubit to a memory qubit is crucial for distributed quantum computing. However, this requires precise spatiotemporal or frequency/phase alignment. Here, we experimentally demonstrate quantum teleportation-based state transfer from a photon into a spin in a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond robust against both spectral and temporal errors. The achieved fidelity exceeds 0.94 within a frequency error of 100 MHz and 0.93 within an arrival-time error of 100 ns. This achievement enables extraordinarily robust entanglement generation between remote quantum memories compared with the conventional photon-interference-based approaches and paves the way for stable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Optical cavity as a directional quantum emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are essential for testing fundamental physics and for the development of quantum technologies. In this work, we theoretically investigate a single-photon source based on a two-photon Jaynes-Cummings system, where the cavity works as the quantum emitter rather than the atom. This role reversal provides certain advantages, such as robustness against atomic losses, as the atom remains in its ground state throughout the entire dynamics. This provides higher efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability compared to sources based on the usual JC model under the same parameter conditions in both models. Another advantage of this system is the possibility of direct conversion of a coherent excitation pulse with one photon on average to a single-photon pulse with efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability above $90\%$. Since the entire excitation pulse is consumed in the generation of a single photon, the system also minimizes energy waste. The potential for implementing the two-photon JC model across different platforms expands the possibilities for controlled single-photon generation in applications in quantum information processing and computation.</description>

      <title>Dephasing in Rydberg Facilitation Due to State-Dependent Dipole Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms allow for the experimental study of open many-body systems and nonequilibrium phenomena. High dephasing rates are a generic feature of these systems, and therefore they can often be described by rate equations, i.e. in the classical limit. In this work, we analyze one potential origin of the decoherence in Rydberg atoms: dipole-force induced dephasing. As the wave function of the Rydberg (spin-up) state is repelled in the presence of another nearby Rydberg atom, while the ground (spin-down) state diffuses in place, the Franck-Condon overlap between the two spin components quickly decays causing a decoherence of the spin transition. With an analytic approach we obtain a simple expression for the dephasing rate of the Rydberg state depending on atomic and laser parameters, which agrees with numerical findings.</description>

      <title>Quantum ($t$,$n$) Threshold Multi-Secret Sharing based on Cluster States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing is an encryption technique based on quantum mechanics, which utilizes uncertainty principle to achieve security in transmission. Most protocols focus on the study of quantum ($n,n$) or ($t,n$) threshold single secret sharing. In this paper, the first quantum ($t,n$) threshold multi-secret sharing protocol based on Lagrangian interpolation and cluster states is proposed, which requires only $t$ instead of $n$ participants to reconstruct multiple quantum secrets. The protocol exploits the security properties of the cluster state to transmit shared information in two parts, quantum and classical, where the shares remain private after reconstructing quantum secrets. Meanwhile, extending the new measurement basis in cluster states enables participants to transmit quantum information without preparing particles. In the presented protocol, the dealer can be offline after sending secrets. And required quantum operations are all common quantum operations, thus the protocol is practical under the current technical conditions. It is proven to be theoretically secure against external and internal attacks by analyzing the protocol under several common external attacks and internal attacks. In addition, experiments on IMB Q prove that the protocol satisfies correctness and feasibility.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Circuit Optimization in Quantum Compilers: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore multilevel circuit optimization (MLCO), where we deploy multiple gate sets and progressively lower the source circuit through the gate sets to the target circuit. At each level, we first perform an appropriate set of circuit simplifications and then lower the simplified circuit into the next level, decomposing the gates not supported there. We demonstrate its effectiveness, using as a case study the source circuit for Hamiltonian simulation to solve a partial differential equation, which is densely populated with multi-controlled gates and is transformed by the state-of-the-art circuit compiler to the target circuit with the quadratic number of CX gates in the number of qubits. MLCO makes visible higher-level circuit structures, providing us with insights about how to simplify the circuits and how to decompose the gates. By putting the right circuit structure in place and selecting the right decomposition algorithm, we could cause massive cancellation of entangling gates, thereby having achieved the quadratic reduction in the number of CX gates.</description>

      <title>Light-Matter Interaction in dispersive Superconducting Circuit QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09322v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that superconducting waveguides strongly attenuate the propagation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies beyond the superconducting gap. In circuit QED, the interaction between non-linear charge qubits and superconducting resonators invariably involves the qubit coupling to a large set of resonator modes. So far, strong dispersion effects near and beyond the superconducting-gap have been ignored in quantization models. Rather, it is assumed that the superconducting resonator behaves ideally across the large frequency intervals. We present a quantization approach which includes the superconducting frequency-dependent surface impedance and demonstrate that superconducting dispersion plays a role in determining the effective light-matter interaction cut-off.</description>

      <title>Context and Complementarity: Formalizing Bohr's Vision through Many-Valued Contextual Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics challenges classical intuitions of space, time, and causality via the superposition principle, which allows systems to exist in multiple states simultaneously. Niels Bohr addressed these paradoxes through his Complementarity Principle, asserting that mutually exclusive properties-such as wave and particle behaviour-are jointly necessary for a complete description of quantum systems. Bohr also emphasized contextuality, the idea that measurement outcomes depend on the broader experimental setup.
  Despite his profound insights, Bohr did not offer a formal logical framework for these concepts. We address this gap by generalizing Reichenbach's three-valued logic into a seven-valued, formally contextual system, where contextuality is explicitly encoded via existential quantifiers. This logic retains Reichenbach's indeterminate value while modelling conditional truths across incompatible measurements, resolving key quantum paradoxes without logical inconsistency or nonlocality.
  Our approach draws inspiration from Jain logic which embraces multiple, context-dependent truths. Beyond quantum theory, this framework has potential applications in perceptual psychology and cognitive science, where context and contradiction also play central roles. The aim is to extend Bohr's legacy by equipping his epistemological vision with rigorous, many-valued logical tools.</description>

      <title>TensorRL-QAS: Reinforcement learning with tensor networks for scalable quantum architecture search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, but they face the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates this design process, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise, severely impacting performance. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, a scalable framework that combines tensor network (TN) methods with RL for designing quantum circuits. By warm-starting the architecture search with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits, accelerating convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces function evaluations by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to $98\%$, and achieves up to $50\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems-far exceeding the $&lt;1\%$ rates of baseline approaches. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of up to 8-qubit. These advancements establish TensorRL-QAS as a promising candidate for a scalable and efficient quantum circuit discovery protocol on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Parameter-Efficient Learning for Typhoon Trajectory Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typhoon trajectory forecasting is essential for disaster preparedness but remains computationally demanding due to the complexity of atmospheric dynamics and the resource requirements of deep learning models. Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy. This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spin states obtained by extracting $n$ electrons from closed-shell fermionic states. A partition of the system is defined through the introduction of the extraction modes. We derive the expression of the $n$-body reduced density matrices, which represent the extracted spin states. We show that these states exhibit different forms of spin entanglement, whose detection is discussed in terms of the spin squeezing inequalities.</description>

      <title>Gravimetry enhanced by nonreciprocal optomechanical coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how to measure the gravitational acceleration by using a dissipative optomechanical cavity. What is quite different from the conventional measurement methods is that we have constructed a nonreciprocal optomechanical coupling. We demonstrate that nonreciprocal coupling has a much greater advantage than reciprocal coupling. When the coherent optomechanical coupling is relatively weak and the driving intensity of single photon is strong, nonreciprocal coupling can improve the measurement precision by a factor of two. When the driving strength of single photon tends to infinity, reciprocal coupling fails to obtain any information about the gravitational acceleration, while nonreciprocal coupling still does. Using a two-photon driving, the measurement uncertainty of the gravitational acceleration will tend to zero as the intensity of two-photon driving approaches the critical point. The critical value of the two-photon driving intensity required for nonreciprocal coupling is finite, but the critical value of the two-photon driving intensity required for reciprocal coupling is infinite. The combination of the amplification of mechanical parameters and the extra force can not improve the measurement precision, but it can enhance the susceptibility. Furthermore, when the single-photon driving field is relatively weak, we analytically calculate the quantum Fisher information. The results show that, under most experimental parameters, nonreciprocal coupling still performs better than reciprocal coupling.</description>

      <title>Unraveling spin entanglement using quantum gates with scanning tunneling microscopy-driven electron spin resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing, and its controlled generation and detection remain key challenges in scalable quantum architectures. Here, we numerically demonstrate the deterministic generation of entangled spin states in a solid-state platform by implementing quantum gates via electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM). Using two titanium atoms on a MgO/Ag(100) substrate as a model, we construct a two-qubit system whose dynamics are coherently manipulated through tailored microwave pulse sequences. We generate Bell states by implementing a Hadamard gate followed by a controlled-NOT gate, and evaluate its fidelity and concurrence using the quantum-master equation-based code TimeESR. Our results demonstrate that ESR-STM can create entangled states with significant fidelity. This study paves the way for the realization of atom-based quantum circuits and highlights ESR-STM as a powerful tool for probing and engineering entangled states on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Zassenhaus Expansion in Solving the Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a central task in quantum computing, with wide-ranging applications in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and combinatorial optimization. A fundamental challenge lies in approximating the unitary evolution operator \( e^{-i\mathcal{H}t} \), where \( \mathcal{H} \) is a large, typically non-commuting, Hermitian operator, using resource-efficient methods suitable for near-term devices. We present a refinement of the fixed-depth simulation framework introduced by E. K\"okc\"u et al, incorporating the second-order Zassenhaus expansion to systematically factorize the time evolution operator into a product of exponentials of local Hamiltonian terms and their nested commutators, truncated at second order. This yields a controlled, non-unitary approximation with error scaling as \( \mathcal{O}(t^3) \), preserving constant circuit depth and significantly reducing gate counts compared to first-order Trotterization. Unlike higher-order Trotter or Taylor methods, our approach algebraically isolates non-commutative corrections and embeds them into a depth-independent ansatz. We further exploit the quaternary structure and closure properties of Lie subalgebras to evaluate commutators analytically, circumventing explicit matrix exponentiation and reducing classical preprocessing overhead. This enables efficient simulation of Hamiltonians with bounded operator norm and structured locality, including those encountered in realistic quantum chemistry and spin-lattice models. Our method retains simulation fidelity while relaxing strict unitarity constraints, offering a scalable and accurate framework for fixed-depth quantum simulation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate work extraction protocols designed to transfer the maximum possible energy to a battery using sequential access to $N$ copies of an unknown pure qubit state. The core challenge is designing interactions to optimally balance two competing goals: charging of the battery optimally using the qubit in hand, and acquiring more information by qubit to improve energy harvesting in subsequent rounds. Here, we leverage exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning to develop adaptive strategies achieving energy dissipation that scales only poly-logarithmically in $N$. This represents an exponential improvement over current protocols based on full state tomography.</description>

      <title>The Parity Flow Formalism: Tracking Quantum Information Throughout Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Parity Flow formalism, a method for tracking the information flow in quantum circuits. This method adds labels to quantum circuit diagrams such that the action of Clifford gates can be understood as a recoding of quantum information. The action of non-Clifford gates in the encoded space can be directly deduced from those labels without backtracking. An application of flow tracking is to design resource-efficient quantum circuits by changing any present encoding via a simple set of rules. Finally, the Parity Flow formalism can be used in combination with stabilizer codes to further reduce quantum circuit depth and to reveal additional operations that can be implemented in parallel.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Connections between Tensor Network and Stabilizer Formalism by Cutting in Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network and stabilizer formalism are two main approaches for classical simulations of quantum systems. In this work, we explore their connections from a quantum resource perspective on simulating $UOU^\dag$ with $O$ an arbitrary operator ranging from pure state density matrices to Pauli operators. For the tensor network approach, we show that its complexity, quantified by entanglement, is governed by the interplay of two other types of quantum resources, coherence and magic. Crucially, which one has the predominant influence on entanglement is elucidated by what we term the time entanglement of $O$. As time entanglement increases, the dominant resource shifts from coherence to magic. Numerical experiments are conducted to support this claim. For the stabilizer formalism approach, we propose an operator stabilizer formalism to enable its application to arbitrary $O$, whose complexity always relies on magic. The operator stabilizer formalism is also powerful than the standard one for simulating some quantum circuits with special structures. Therefore, as the time entanglement increases, the governing resources between the two approaches change from being uncorrelated to highly correlated.</description>

      <title>Resonant cavity-QED with chiral flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands exhibit high degeneracy and intrinsic localization, offering a promising platform for enhanced light-matter interactions. Here, we investigate the resonant interaction between a two-level emitter and a chiral flat band hosted by a photonic lattice. In the weak coupling regime, the emitter undergoes Rabi oscillations with a lifted photonic mode whose spatial structure reflects the nature of compact localized states and the onset of Anderson localization. We illustrate our approach using selected chiral quasi-1D lattices. Our findings provide a route to flat band state preparation via quench dynamics while preserving the structure of the flat band.</description>

      <title>The Magnus expansion for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magnus expansion offers a method to express a time-ordered exponential as an ordinary operatorial exponential. This representation has advantageous theoretical properties, while still solving the original differential equation. For any finite dimensional Hermitian Hamiltonians, the standard Magnus expansion guarantees a manifestly unitary representation. However, this property is no longer preserved if the Hamiltonian is infinite dimensional or non-Hermitian. In this work, we derive a generalized expansion that maintains the property of unitarity for all bounded finite dimensional Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Improved Sample Upper and Lower Bounds for Trace Estimation of Quantum State Powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As often emerges in various basic quantum properties such as entropy, the trace of quantum state powers $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^q)$ has attracted a lot of attention. The recent work of Liu and Wang (SODA 2025) showed that $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^q)$ can be estimated to within additive error $\varepsilon$ with a dimension-independent sample complexity of $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon^{3+\frac{2}{q-1}})$ for any constant $q &gt; 1$, where only an $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bound was given. In this paper, we significantly improve the sample complexity of estimating $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^q)$ in both the upper and lower bounds. In particular:
  - For $q &gt; 2$, we settle the sample complexity with matching upper and lower bounds $\widetilde \Theta(1/\varepsilon^2)$.
  - For $1 &lt; q &lt; 2$, we provide an upper bound $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon^{\frac{2}{q-1}})$, with a lower bound $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^{\max\{\frac{1}{q-1}, 2\}})$ for dimension-independent estimators, implying there is only room for a quadratic improvement.
  Our upper bounds are obtained by (non-plug-in) quantum estimators based on weak Schur sampling, in sharp contrast to the prior approach based on quantum singular value transformation and samplizer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on experimental studies of the distribution of the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix of open microwave networks with symplectic symmetry and a chaotic wave dynamics. These consist of two geometrically identical subgraphs with unitary symmetry described by complex conjugate Hamiltonians, that are coupled by a pair of bonds. The results are compared to random-matrix theory predictions obtained on the basis of the Heidelberg approach for the scattering matrix of open quantum-chaotic systems. We demonstrate that deviations from random-matrix theory predictions observed in the distributions may be attributed to the fact that the subgraphs are not fully connected.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of bubble nucleation across a quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The liquid-vapor transition is a classic example of a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition. Such transitions underlie many phenomena in cosmology, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. They give rise to long-lived metastable states, whose decay can be driven by either thermal or quantum fluctuations. Yet, direct experimental observations of how these states collapse into a stable phase remain elusive in the quantum regime. Here, we use a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the real-time dynamics of ``bubble nucleation'' induced by quantum fluctuations. Bubbles are localized domains of the stable phase which spontaneously form, or nucleate, and expand as the system is driven across a discontinuous quantum phase transition. Implementing a mixed-field Ising spin model with tunable and time-dependent interactions, we track the microscopic evolution of the metastable state as the Hamiltonian parameters are varied in time with various speeds, bringing the system out of equilibrium. Site-resolved measurements reveal the emergence and evolution of finite-size quantum bubbles, providing direct insight into the mechanism by which the metastable phase decays. We also identify nonequilibrium scaling behavior near the transition, consistent with a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results demonstrate the power of quantum simulators to probe out-of-equilibrium many-body physics, including quantum bubble nucleation, a key feature of discontinuous quantum phase transitions, with application to studies of matter formation in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Quantifying complexity of continuous-variable quantum states via Wehrl entropy and Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of complexity of quantum states is quite different from uncertainty or information contents, and involves the tradeoff between its classical and quantum features. In this work, we we introduce a quantifier of complexity of continuous-variable states, e.g. quantum optical states, based on the Husimi quasiprobability distribution. This quantity is built upon two functions of the state: the Wehrl entropy, capturing the spread of the distribution, and the Fisher information with respect to location parameters, which captures the opposite behaviour, i.e. localization in phase space. We analyze the basic properties of the quantifier and illustrate its features by evaluating complexity of Gaussian states and some relevant non-Gaussian states. We further generalize the quantifier in terms of s-ordered phase-space distributions and illustrate its implications.</description>

      <title>How to Incorporate External Fields in Analog Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). They consist of artificial spins that evolve towards a low-energy configuration representing a problem's solution. Most realistic COPs require both spin-spin couplings and external fields. In IMs with analog spins, these interactions scale differently with the continuous spin amplitudes, leading to imbalances that affect performance. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but their performance has not been benchmarked. We address this gap through a numerical analysis. We evaluate the time-to-solution of these methods across three distinct problem classes with up to 500 spins. Our results show that the most effective way to incorporate external fields is through an approach where the spin interactions are proportional to the spin signs, rather than their continuous amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Topological Parity Anomaly and Half-integer Hall Effect in High-dimensional Synthetic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in constructing synthetic dimension provide a powerful tool for exploring exotic topological states of matter in high dimensions. Here we report that the parity anomaly and associated \textit{half-integer} quantized Hall conductance, arising in 2$j$+1 (space-time) dimensions with a single or odd number of Dirac cones, can be realized by the boundary states of $n$-th order topological insulators in (2$j$+$n$)-dimensional synthetic lattices. We establish a general bulk-boundary correspondence by integrating the ``nested" Wilson loop theory with the time-reversal polarization at highly-symmetric momenta, a set of $Z_2$ topological invariants are extracted which determines the number of higher-order-boundary Dirac cones and their locations. We develop a general construction procedure for Hamiltonians supporting such higher-order topological parity anomaly. Moreover, we propose an experimental implementation scheme based on photonic synthetic dimensions and provide a method for probing the associated half-integer Hall conductance by the transmission spectra. Our work offers the realization and characterization of parity anomaly in general high-dimensional higher-order topological insulators and opens an avenue for exploring fundamental physics and possible device applications enabled by manipulating Dirac cones.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Spin Waves in Doubly Periodic Magnonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards the development of strategies for tailoring spin-wave band gaps in magnonic crystals, this work examines the band gap properties in a one-dimensional magnonic crystal with double periodicity. A long and narrow yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film strip is etched with an array of transverse groove lines separated by alternating distances, where the second distance is twice the first. This double periodicity in the magnonic crystal translates into dissimilar band gaps in the frequency domain, with the third and sixth band gaps being more pronounced than others. These band gaps are more pronounced because the corresponding wavenumbers simultaneously satisfy the Bragg scattering conditions for the periods equal to the two groove separations as well as their sum. Experimental observations are reproduced by numerical simulations. Together, the experimental and numerical results demonstrate how multiple periodicities could be an effective design parameter for creating magnonic crystals with desired band gaps.</description>

      <title>Scalable Trapped Ion Addressing with Adjoint-optimized Multimode Photonic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum computing requires precise optical control for individual qubit manipulation. However, conventional free-space optics face challenges in alignment stability and scalability as the number of qubits increases. Integrated photonics offers a promising alternative, providing miniaturized optical systems on a chip. Here, we propose a design for a multimode photonic circuit integrated with a surface-electrode ion trap capable of targeted and reconfigurable light delivery. Three closely positioned ions can be addressed using a focusing grating coupler that emits multimode light through electrode openings to ions trapped 80 $\mu$m above the chip. Simulations show that the couplers achieve diffraction-limited spot with a 4.3 $\mu$m beam waist along the trap axis and 2.2 $\mu$m perpendicular to the trap axis. Controlled interference of the TE$_{\text{10}}$ and TE$_{\text{20}}$ modes results in crosstalk of -20 dB to -30 dB at ion separations of 5-8 $\mu$m when addressing ions individually, and down to -60 dB when two of the three ions are addressed simultaneously. Additionally, the higher-order TE modes can offer a novel mechanism for driving spin-motion coupling transitions, potentially enabling alternative approaches to quantum gates and simulations. The proposed integrated platform offers a viable path for constructing large-scale trapped-ion systems, leveraging the benefits of nanophotonic design for precise and reliable ion manipulation.</description>

      <title>Probing arbitrary polarized photon pairs undergoing double Compton scatterings by a dedicated MC simulator validated with experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the degree of polarization of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\Delta\hat\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample --based on a total of $3 \times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector. We deduce the value of the squared visibility (interference contrast) encoding the polarization in the angle difference of the two scattering planes, $\Delta\hat\Phi$. The simulated spectra are in good agreement with the experimental correlation spectra and behave as predicted by theory.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Photonic Chip Design via Interpretable Machine Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic chip design has seen significant advancements with the adoption of inverse design methodologies, offering flexibility and efficiency in optimizing device performance. However, the black-box nature of the optimization approaches, such as those used in inverse design in order to minimize a loss function or maximize coupling efficiency, poses challenges in understanding the outputs. This challenge is prevalent in machine learning-based optimization methods, which can suffer from the same lack of transparency. To this end, interpretability techniques address the opacity of optimization models. In this work, we apply interpretability techniques from machine learning, with the aim of gaining understanding of inverse design optimization used in designing photonic components, specifically two-mode multiplexers. We base our methodology on the widespread interpretability technique known as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, or LIME. As a result, LIME-informed insights point us to more effective initial conditions, directly improving device performance. This demonstrates that interpretability methods can do more than explain models -- they can actively guide and enhance the inverse-designed photonic components. Our results demonstrate the ability of interpretable techniques to reveal underlying patterns in the inverse design process, leading to the development of better-performing components.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial derivative pricing is a significant challenge in finance, involving the valuation of instruments like options based on underlying assets. While some cases have simple solutions, many require complex classical computational methods like Monte Carlo simulations and numerical techniques. However, as derivative complexities increase, these methods face limitations in computational power. Cases involving Non-Vanilla Basket pricing, American Options, and derivative portfolio risk analysis need extensive computations in higher-dimensional spaces, posing challenges for classical computers.
  Quantum computing presents a promising avenue by harnessing quantum superposition and entanglement, allowing the handling of high-dimensional spaces effectively. In this paper, we introduce a self-contained and all-encompassing quantum algorithm that operates without reliance on oracles or presumptions. More specifically, we develop an effective stochastic method for simulating exponentially many potential asset paths in quantum parallel, leading to a highly accurate final distribution of stock prices. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this algorithm can be extended to price more complex options and analyze risk within derivative portfolios.</description>

      <title>Subskin modes in a nonlinear non-Hermitian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subskin modes are distinct from conventional skin modes as they localize not at the system's edge but rather below the edge. Unlike skin modes, where a substantial number of them can accumulate at the boundaries of a system due to the non-Hermitian skin effect, subskin modes are typically limited to one or a few and emerge only when the size of the system and the couplings are related in a very specific way. The nonlinear interaction can lift the restrictions on the couplings for the formation of these modes. The findings reveal the potential of subskin modes for practical applications and new research in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature High-Purity Single Photon Emission from Carbon-Doped Boron Nitride Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an excellent host material for generating room temperature single photons exhibiting high brightness and spin-photon entanglement. However, challenges in improving purity, stability, and scalability limit its use in quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate highly pure and stable single photon emitters (SPEs) in hBN by directly growing carbon-doped, centimeter-scale hBN thin films using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. These SPEs exhibit room temperature operation with polarized emission, achieving a g(2)(0) value of 0.015, which is among the lowest reported for room temperature SPEs and the lowest achieved for hBN SPEs. It also exhibits high brightness ( around 0.5 million counts per second), remarkable stability during continuous operation (&gt; 15 minutes), and a Debye-Waller factor of 45%. First-principles calculations reveal unique carbon defects responsible for these properties, enabled by PLD's low-temperature synthesis and in-situ doping. Our results demonstrate an effective method for large-scale production of high-purity, stable SPEs in hBN, enabling robust quantum optical sources for various applications.</description>

Abstract: Simulating $\mathrm{U(1)}$ quantum gauge theories with spatial dimension greater than one is of great physical significance yet has not been achieved experimentally. Here we propose a simple realization of $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory on triangular lattice Rydberg atom arrays. Within experimentally accessible range, we find that the effective model well simulates various aspects of the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory, such as emergence of topological sectors, incommensurability, and the deconfined Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Our proposal is easy to implement experimentally and exhibits pronounced quantum dynamics compared with previous proposals realizing $\mathrm{U(1)}$ and $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Randomized adiabatic quantum linear solver algorithm with optimal complexity scaling and detailed running costs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving linear systems of equations is a fundamental problem with a wide variety of applications across many fields of science, and there is increasing effort to develop quantum linear solver algorithms. [Suba\c{s}i et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. (2019)] proposed a randomized algorithm inspired by adiabatic quantum computing, based on a sequence of random Hamiltonian simulation steps, with suboptimal scaling in the condition number $\kappa$ of the linear system and the target error $\epsilon$. Here we go beyond these results in several ways. Firstly, using filtering [Lin et al., Quantum (2019)] and Poissonization techniques [Cunningham et al., arXiv:2406.03972 (2024)], the algorithm complexity is improved to the optimal scaling $O(\kappa \log(1/\epsilon))$ - an exponential improvement in $\epsilon$, and a shaving of a $\log \kappa$ scaling factor in $\kappa$. Secondly, the algorithm is further modified to achieve constant factor improvements, which are vital as we progress towards hardware implementations on fault-tolerant devices. We introduce a cheaper randomized walk operator method replacing Hamiltonian simulation - which also removes the need for potentially challenging classical precomputations; randomized routines are sampled over optimized random variables; circuit constructions are improved. We obtain a closed formula rigorously upper bounding the expected number of times one needs to apply a block-encoding of the linear system matrix to output a quantum state encoding the solution to the linear system. The upper bound is $867 \kappa$ at $\epsilon=10^{-10}$ for Hermitian matrices.</description>

Abstract: We provide multi-player quantum data hiding based on nonlocal quantum state ensembles arising from multi-party quantum state discrimination. Using bounds on local minimum-error discrimination of multi-party quantum states, we construct a multi-player quantum data-hiding scheme. Our data-hiding scheme can be used to hide multiple bits, asymptotically, unless all the players collaborate. We also illustrate our results by examples of nonlocal quantum state ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two systems for a charged particle are studied, the first one when it is under the effect of a constant electric field, and the second one when it is under the effect of a constant electromagnetic field. For both systems, it is possible to find time-dependent conserved operators that can be used to derive time-dependent wave functions to the complete Schr\"odinger equation, such that the time variable is not separable from the space coordinates. At the same time, these conserved operators are used to build up a unitary operators, which define the symmetries of the systems. Then, it is shown that the invariance of the wave function under the action of these unitary operators leads to the quantization of resistance as integer multiples of the Klitzing's constant.</description>

      <title>Self-testing tilted strategies for maximal loophole-free nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree of experimentally attainable nonlocality, as gauged by the loophole-free or effective violation of Bell inequalities, remains severely limited due to inefficient detectors. We address an experimentally motivated question: Which quantum strategies attain the maximal loophole-free nonlocality in the presence of inefficient detectors? For any Bell inequality and any specification of detection efficiencies, the optimal strategies are those that maximally violate a tilted version of the Bell inequality in ideal conditions. In the simplest scenario, we demonstrate that the quantum strategies that maximally violate the doubly-tilted versions of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality are unique up to local isometries. We utilize a Jordan's lemma and Gr\"obner basis-based proof technique to analytically derive self-testing statements for the entire family of doubly-tilted CHSH inequalities and numerically demonstrate their robustness. These results enable us to reveal the insufficiency of even high levels of the Navascu\'es--Pironio--Ac\'in hierarchy to saturate the maximum quantum violation of these inequalities.</description>

Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models, which are phenomenological mechanisms introduced and designed to account for dynamical wavepacket reduction, are attracting a growing interest from the community interested in the characterisation of the quantum-to-classical transition. Here, we introduce a quantum-probing approach to the quest of deriving metrological upper bounds on the free parameters of such empirical models. To illustrate our approach, we consider an extended quantum Ising chain whose elements are -- either individually or collectively -- affected by a mechanism responsible for spontaneous collapse. We explore configurations involving out-of-equilibrium states of the chain, which allows us to infer information about the collapse mechanism before it is completely scrambled from the state of the system. Moreover, we investigate potential amplification effects on the probing performance based on the exploitation of quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Heuristic Algorithms for Adiabatic Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous established machine learning models and various neural network architectures can be restructured as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. A significant challenge in Adiabatic Quantum Machine Learning (AQML) is the computational demand of the training phase. To mitigate this, approximation techniques inspired by quantum annealing, like Simulated Annealing and Multiple Start Tabu Search (MSTS), have been employed to expedite QUBO-based AQML training. This paper introduces a novel hybrid algorithm that incorporates an "r-flip" strategy. This strategy is aimed at solving large-scale QUBO problems more effectively, offering better solution quality and lower computational costs compared to existing MSTS methods. The r-flip approach has practical applications in diverse fields, including cross-docking, supply chain management, machine scheduling, and fraud detection. The paper details extensive computational experiments comparing this r-flip enhanced hybrid heuristic against a standard MSTS approach. These tests utilize both standard benchmark problems and three particularly large QUBO instances. The results indicate that the r-flip enhanced method consistently produces high-quality solutions efficiently, operating within practical time constraints.</description>

      <title>Bosonic randomized benchmarking with passive transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized benchmarking (RB) is the most commonly employed protocol for the characterization of unitary operations in quantum circuits due to its reasonable experimental requirements and robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. So far, the protocol has been limited to discrete or fermionic systems, whereas extensions to bosonic systems have been unclear for a long time due to challenges arising from the underlying infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this work, we close the gap for bosonic systems and develop an RB protocol to benchmark passive Gaussian transformations on any particle number subspace, which we call bosonic passive RB. The protocol is based on the recently developed filtered RB framework and is designed to isolate the multitude of exponential decays arising for passive bosonic transformations. We give explicit formulas and a Julia implementation for the necessary post-processing of the experimental data. We also analyze the sampling complexity of bosonic passive RB by deriving analytical expressions for the variance. They show a mild scaling with the number of modes, suggesting that passive bosonic RB is experimentally feasible for a moderate number of modes. We focus on experimental settings involving Fock states and particle number resolving measurements, but also discuss Gaussian settings, deriving first results for heterodyne measurements.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum gates for exchange-only qubits using simultaneous exchange pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin qubit types is the universal control using only voltage controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from non-orthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit and two-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of $X$ rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.</description>

Abstract: Informational contributions to thermodynamics can be studied in isolation by considering systems with fully-degenerate Hamiltonians. In this regime, being in non-equilibrium -- termed informational non-equilibrium -- provides thermodynamic resources, such as extractable work, solely from the information content. The usefulness of informational non-equilibrium creates an incentive to obtain more of it, motivating the question of how to concentrate it: can we increase the local informational non-equilibrium of a product state $\rho\otimes\rho$ under a global closed system (unitary) evolution? We fully solve this problem analytically, showing that it is impossible for two-qubits, and it is always possible to find states achieving this in higher dimensions. Specifically for two-qutrits, we find that there is a single unitary achieving optimal concentration for every state, for which we uncover a Mepmba-like effect. We further discuss the notion of bound resources in this framework, initial global correlations' ability to activate concentration, and applications to concentrating purity and intrinsic randomness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the R\'enyi-1 Correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the R\'enyi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a route toward scalably detecting certain SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The R\'enyi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-hermitian Kitaev chain model, for arbitrary complex parameters. In particular, we give a concise characterisation of the curves of eigenvalues in the complex plane in the infinite size limit, using a novel method which can be applied to other non-hermitian systems. Using this solution, we characterise under which conditions the skin effect is absent, and for which eigenstates this is the case. We also fully determine the region in parameter space for which the model has a zero mode.</description>

      <title>Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states. We find that, in stark contrast to displacement and two-photon squeezing, higher-order squeezing leads to oscillatory dynamics. The state is squeezed in the initial stages of the dynamics but the squeezing reverses at later stages, and the state reverts almost completely back to the initial state. We analyze various quantities to verify that the oscillatory dynamics is physical and not a mathematical artefact. We also show that the maximum squeezing diminishes with increasing squeezing order, rendering the squeezing mechanism increasingly ineffective. Our results provide important rules that can help guide the development of more effective higher-order squeezing techniques.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Centric Super-Krylov Diagonalization Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum system is ubiquitous in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Krylov quantum diagonalization (KQD) methods have emerged as a promising approach for this task, although many existing methods rely on subroutines - particularly the Hadamard test - that are challenging to implement on near-term quantum computers. We present a KQD method that uses only real-time evolutions and recovery probabilities, making it very well adapted for existing quantum hardware. Additionally, we propose a classical post-processing derivative estimation algorithm. Under assumptions on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, we prove that our algorithm converges exponentially quickly to the ground-state energy. Finally, we provide classical numerical simulations for the transverse-field Ising model on 100 qubits.</description>

      <title>Super-bath Quantum Eigensolver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of the dynamics of a system coupled to a low-temperature environment is a promising application of quantum computers to determine ground-state properties of physical systems. However, this approach requires not only the $\textit{existence}$ of an environment that allows the system to dissipate energy and evolve to its ground state, but also the $\textit{detailed knowledge}$ of the properties of the bath. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for ground state preparation which only relies on the $\textit{existence}$ of a physical bath which achieves the same task, while a detailed description of the environment may remain $\textit{unknown}$. In particular, we show that this ``super-bath quantum eigensolver algorithm'' prepares the ground state of the system by combining a Gaussian stabilization dephasing procedure with the simulation of the interaction between the system and a super-bath which only requires minimal knowledge of the physical environment. Based on our algorithmic framework, we establish a partial order relation among environments. Supported by experimental lifetime data of nuclear metastable states, we suggest that our algorithm is applicable to determine nuclear ground states in polynomial time. These results highlight the potential advantage of quantum computing in addressing ground state problems in real-world physical systems.</description>

      <title>Critical properties in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.</description>

      <title>Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-R\'enyi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Iterative Algorithm for Qubit Mapping via Layer-Weight Assignment and Search Space Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current quantum devices support interactions only between physically adjacent qubits, preventing quantum circuits from being directly executed on these devices. Therefore, SWAP gates are required to remap logical qubits to physical qubits, which in turn increases both quantum resource consumption and error rates. To minimize the insertion of additional SWAP gates, we propose HAIL, an efficient iterative qubit mapping algorithm. Leveraging the inherent parallelism in quantum circuits, a new layer-weight assignment method is integrated with subgraph isomorphism to derive an optimal initial qubit mapping. Moreover, we present a two-stage SWAP sequence search algorithm that effectively identifies the most efficient SWAP sequence by distilling feasible SWAP sequences at different stages. The whole qubit mapping algorithm is then refined through a few iterative bidirectional traversals, further reducing the number of SWAP gates required. Experimental results on the IBM Q20 architecture and various benchmarks show that HAIL-3 reduces the number of additional gates inserted in the $\mathcal{B}_{23}$ by 20.62\% compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, we propose a partially extended SWAP sequence strategy combined with HAIL to reduce its time complexity, with experiments on the sparsely connected Google Sycamore architecture demonstrating reductions in both algorithm runtime and additional SWAP gates.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Measurement Problem: A Review of Recent Trends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Left on its own, a quantum state evolves deterministically under the Schr\"odinger Equation, forming superpositions. Upon measurement, however, a stochastic process governed by the Born rule collapses it to a single outcome. This dual evolution of quantum states -- the core of the Measurement Problem -- has puzzled physicists and philosophers for nearly a century. Yet, amid the cacophony of competing interpretations, the problem today is not as impenetrable as it once seemed. This paper reviews the current status of the Measurement Problem, distinguishing between what is well understood and what remains unresolved. We examine key theoretical approaches, including decoherence, many-worlds interpretation, objective collapse theories, hidden-variable theories, dualistic approaches, deterministic models, and epistemic interpretations. To make these discussions accessible to a broader audience, we also reference curated online resources that provide high-quality introductions to central concepts.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Trap Design on the Scalability of Trapped-Ion Quantum Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To increase the power of a trapped ion quantum information processor, the qubit number, gate speed, and gate fidelity must all increase. All three of these parameters are influenced by the trapping field which in turn depends on the electrode geometry. Here we consider how the electrode geometry affects the radial trapping parameters: trap height, harmonicity, depth, and trap frequency. We introduce a simple multi-wafer geometry comprising a ground plane above a surface trap and compare the performance of this trap to a surface trap and a multi-wafer trap that is a miniaturized version of a linear Paul trap. We compare the voltage and frequency requirements needed to reach a desired radial trap frequency and find that the two multi-wafer trap designs provide significant improvements in expected power dissipation over the surface trap design in large part due to increased harmonicity. Finally, we consider the fabrication requirements and the path towards integration of the necessary optical control. This work provides a basis to optimize future trap designs with scalability in mind.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg and Heisenberg-Like Representations via Hilbert Space Bundle Geometry in the Non-Hermitian Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equivalence between the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg representations is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. However, this relationship remains unclear in the non-Hermitian regime, particularly when the Hamiltonian is time-dependent. In this study, we address this gap by establishing the connection between the two representations, incorporating the metric of the Hilbert space bundle. We not only demonstrate the consistency between the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg representations but also present a Heisenberg-like representation grounded in the generalized vielbein formalism, which provides a clear and intuitive geometric interpretation. Unlike the standard Heisenberg representation, where the metric of the Hilbert space is encoded solely in the dual states, the Heisenberg-like representation distributes the metric information between both the states and the dual states. Despite this distinction, it retains the same Heisenberg equation of motion for operators. Within this formalism, the Hamiltonian is replaced by a Hermitian counterpart, while the "non-Hermiticity" is transferred to the operators. Moreover, this approach extends to regimes with a dynamical metric (beyond the pseudo-Hermitian framework) and to systems governed by time-dependent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open Quantum Walks (OQW) are a type of quantum walk governed by the system's interaction with its environment. We explore the time evolution and the limit behavior of the OQW framework for Quantum Computation and show how we can represent random unitary quantum channels, such as the dephasing and depolarizing channels, in this model. We also develop a simulation protocol with circuit representation for this model, which is heavily inspired by the fact that graphs represent OQW and are, thereby, local (meaning that the state in a particular node interacts only with its neighborhood). We obtain asymptotic advantages in the system's dimension, circuit depth, and CNOT count compared to other simulation methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve three important problems that are revealed, in particular, in matrix-manipulation algorithms. The principal novelty is introducing the concept of controlled measurement that solves the problem of small access probability to the desired state of ancilla and possesses several remarkable properties. We also introduce separate encoding of the real and imaginary parts of a complex matrix that allows to include the Hermitian conjugation into the list of matrix manipulations. Finally, we weaken the constraints on the absolute values of matrix elements unavoidably imposed by the normalization condition for a pure quantum state. The controlled measurement together with both other extensions are implemented into the matrix multiplication algorithm. The appropriate circuits are presented.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Characterization of Al/AlxOy/Al Josephson Junctions at Room Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qudit-based quantum gates offer several advantages over qubit-based counterparts, such as higher information density, the ability to address more complex problems, and richer quantum operations. In this paper, we present three realistic protocols for implementing a 4$\times$4-dimensional (16D) two-qudit controlled-SUM (CSUM) gate, where the 4D control qudit and 4D target qudit are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom (DoF) and spatial DoF of two photons, respectively. The first protocol is implemented exclusively using linear optical elements without auxiliary resources, making it feasible with current optical technologies and achieving an efficiency of 1/9. The second protocol utilizes photon scattering by a microcavity-quantum-dot system, enabling the 16D CSUM gate to operate deterministically without postselection. The third protocol introduces an error-heralded mechanism based on the second protocol, theoretically achieving unity fidelity. Moreover, all protocols operate without ancillary photons, offering the advantages of compact circuits and low cost while further promoting the development of high-dimensional quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

The resulting family of effective Hamiltonians reproduces the well-known Floquet-Magnus expansion, now enhanced with explicit error bounds that quantify the distance between the exact and approximate dynamics at each order, even in cases where the Floquet-Magnus series fails to converge. We apply the method to the semiclassical Rabi model and provide explicit error bounds for both the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian and its third-order refinement. Our analysis shows that, while the rotating-wave approximation more accurately captures the true dynamics than the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian in most regimes, the third-order approximation ultimately outperforms both.</description>

      <title>Simplified Fermionic Scattering State Preparation for the NISQ Era</title>

Abstract: With quantum computers steadily improving, large volume quantum scattering simulations is getting very close. Yet, in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era, we are limited to shallow circuits on the order of a thousand layers. Thus, accurate and efficient state preparation methods are needed. We introduce a simplified fermionic scattering state preparation method that reduces circuit depth significantly by partially relaxing the fermionic condition. Using the 1+1D transverse field Ising model as our test bed with exact diagonalization and time evolving block decimation with matrix product states, we show that our simplified states retain nearly all of the behavior of the true fermionic state while being prepared on just a handful of qubits. We also show promising early results on IonQ Forte 1.</description>

      <title>Exponential improvement in quantum simulations of bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous. We also point out that Hamiltonian formulations based on a gauge-invariant Hilbert space require an exponential increase in the resource requirement with respect to using an extended Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Entanglement islands in 1D and 2D lattices with defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial structure of quantum entanglement in one- and two-dimensional lattice systems containing structural defects, using the Time-Dependent Quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method. By constructing reduced density matrices from ensembles of guide waves, we resolve spatial variations in both Coulomb-mediated entanglement and coherence without requiring full many-body wavefunctions. This approach reveals localized regions, entanglement islands, where quantum correlations are enhanced or suppressed due to the presence of vacancies or interaction inhomogeneities. In 1D systems, entanglement tends to concentrate near defects, while in 2D we observe bridge-like and radially symmetric domains. Our results demonstrate that TDQMC offers a scalable and physically transparent framework for real-space quantum information analysis, with implications for quantum materials, entanglement-based sensing, and coherent state engineering.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Interacting Many-Body Systems in the Irrep Basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin models featuring infinite-range, homogeneous all-to-all interactions can be efficiently described due to the existence of a symmetry-restricted Hilbert subspace and an underlying classical phase space structure. However, when the permutation invariance of the system is weakly broken, such as by long- but finite-range interactions, these tools become mathematically invalid. Here we propose to approximately describe these scenarios by considering additional many-body subspaces according to the hierarchy of their coupling to the symmetric subspace, defined by leveraging the structure of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $SU(2)$. We put forward a procedure, dubbed "irrep distillation," which defines these additional subspaces to minimize their dimension at each order of approximation. We discuss the validity of our method in connection with the occurrence of quantum many-body scars, benchmark its utility by analyzing the dynamical and equilibrium phase transitions, outline its phenomenology, and compare its use-cases against other approximations of long-range many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Two-electron quantum walks can probe entanglement and decoherence in an electron microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical physics is often a good approximation for quantum systems composed of many interacting particles, although wavepacket dispersion and scattering processes continuously induce delocalization and entanglement. According to decoherence theory, an entangled ensemble can appear classical when only a subset of all particles is observed. This emergence of macroscopic phenomena from quantum interactions is, for example, relevant for phase transitions, quantum thermalization, hydrodynamics, spin liquids, or time crystals. However, entanglement and decoherence in free electrons have not yet been explored, although the electron is a fundamental elementary particle with extraordinary technological relevance. Here, we investigate the degree of coherence and entanglement in a free-space electron gas in the beam of an ultrafast electron microscope. We introduce a two-electron quantum walk that transforms the quantum state into different bases for quantum state tomography of entangled or partially entangled electron-electron pairs. We apply this novel diagnostic to study quantum effects in short pulses of hundreds of electrons under strong Coulomb correlation. We observe a high contrast interference in the electron-electron correlations but no significant signs of electron-electron entanglement which we explain by limited purity of the initial states and decoherence effects from unmeasured reservoir electrons. The ability to characterize quantum states of multiple free electrons may allow verification of electron-electron entanglement for use in fundamental studies and quantum electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Generalized Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their seminal paper, Einstein Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) had introduced a momentum entangled state for two particles. That state, referred to as the EPR state, has been widely used in studies on entangled particles with continuous degrees of freedom. Later that state was generalized to a form that allows varying degree of entanglement, known as the generalized EPR state. In a suitable limit it reduces to the EPR state. The generalized EPR state is theoretically analyzed here and its entanglement quantified in terms of a recently introduced generalized entanglement measure. This state can also be applied to entangled photons produced from spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). The present analysis is then used in quantifying the entanglement of photons produced from the SPDC process, in terms of certain experimental parameters. A comparison is also made with the Schmidt number, which is normally used as an entanglement measure in such situations. A procedure for experimentally determining the entanglement of SPDC photons has also been described.</description>

      <title>Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Comparing Quantum Annealing and Spiking Neuromorphic Computing for Sampling Binary Sparse Coding QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a sparse binary representation of an image. To be precise, given an image and an overcomplete, non-orthonormal basis, we aim to find a sparse binary vector indicating the minimal set of basis vectors that when added together best reconstruct the given input. We formulate this problem with an $L_2$ loss on the reconstruction error, and an $L_0$ (or, equivalently, an $L_1$) loss on the binary vector enforcing sparsity. This yields a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO), whose optimal solution(s) in general is NP-hard to find. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we solve the sparse representation QUBOs by solving them both on a D-Wave quantum annealer with Pegasus chip connectivity via minor embedding, as well as on the Intel Loihi 2 spiking neuromorphic processor using a stochastic Non-equilibrium Boltzmann Machine (NEBM). Second, we deploy Quantum Evolution Monte Carlo with Reverse Annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2 to evolve the solution quality from the respective machines. The solutions are benchmarked against simulated annealing, a classical heuristic, and the optimal solutions are computed using CPLEX. Iterated reverse quantum annealing performs similarly to simulated annealing, although simulated annealing is always able to sample the optimal solution whereas quantum annealing was not always able to. The Loihi 2 solutions that are sampled are on average more sparse than the solutions from any of the other methods. We demonstrate that both quantum annealing and neuromorphic computing are suitable for binary sparse coding QUBOs, and that Loihi 2 outperforms a D-Wave quantum annealer standard linear-schedule anneal, while iterated reverse quantum annealing performs much better than both unmodified linear-schedule quantum annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of a classical analog of quantum entanglement considering two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse-grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. The coarsening scales range is measured too.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). Here, $N$ is the total number of sites and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature or projection length. To tackle this problem, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. We benchmark the developed algorithm by calculating the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The obtained phase diagram including Fermi surface and Goldstone modes validates the correctness of the algorithm. Remarkably, our method shows the high-efficiency with respect to the existing algorithms, while keeping the high computation precision. We proceed to apply this algorithm to explore the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy and particularly its derivative at Gross-Neveu criticality. Our results elucidate that such critical behavior can be quantified by the correlation length exponent.</description>

      <title>Anderson Localization in Photonic Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solutions of the wave equations for time-independent disordered media can exhibit Anderson localization where instead of wave propagation we observe their localization around different points in space. Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Multifractal-enriched mobility edges and emergent quantum phases in Rydberg atomic arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, the corresponding multifractal-enriched mobility edges and three-state-coexisting quantum phases have yet to be experimentally detected. In this work, we propose exactly-solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models that simultaneously host three-state-coexisting quantum phases, with their phase boundaries analytically derived via Avila's global theorem. Furthermore, we propose experimental protocols via Rydberg atom arrays to realize these states. Notably, we demonstrate a spectroscopic technique capable of measuring inverse participation ratios across real-space and dual-space domains, enabling simultaneous characterization of localized, extended, and multifractal quantum phases in systems with up to tens of qubits. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: The stationary Schr\"odinger equation for an electron in a constant electromagnetic field with a non-Hermitian linear perturbation is studied. The wave function and the spectrum of the system are derived analytically, with the spectrum consisting of Landau levels modified by an additional term associated with the linear Stark effect, proportional to a complex constant $\lambda$. It is shown that this constant arises from an operator $\hat{\Pi}$ that commutes with the Hamiltonian, i.e., $\hat{\Pi}$ is a symmetry of the system. Finally, the Hall conductivity for the lowest Landau level is calculated, showing that it remains exactly equal to the inverse of Klitzing's constant despite the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of disorder</title>

Abstract: We study the finite and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid (NF). In contrast, the insulating phases that survive at high temperatures in the presence of disorder are the Bose glass and the normal fluid. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</description>
