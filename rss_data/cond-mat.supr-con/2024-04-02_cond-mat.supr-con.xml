      <title>Josephson effect in a fractal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson effect is a hallmark signature of the superconducting state, which, however, has been sparsely explored in non-crystalline superconducting materials. Motivated by this, we consider a Josephson junction consisting of two superconductors with a fractal metallic interlayer, which is patterned as a Sierpi\'nski carpet by removing atomic sites in a self-similar and scale-invariant manner. We here show that the fractal geometry has direct observable consequences on the Josephson effect. In particular, we demonstrate that the form of the supercurrent-magnetic field relation as the fractal generation number increases can be directly related to the self-similar fractal geometry of the normal metallic layer. Furthermore, the maxima of the corresponding diffraction pattern directly encode the self-repeating fractal structure in the course of fractal generation, implying that the corresponding magnetic length directly probes the shortest length scale in the given fractal generation. Our results should motivate future experimental efforts to verify these predictions in designer quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Enhanced pair-density-wave vertices in a bilayer Hubbard model at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the pair-density-wave (PDW) state found in the one-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg chain, we report on a determinant quantum Monte Carlo DQMC study of pair-fields for a two- dimensional half-filled Hubbard layer coupled to an itinerant, non-interacting layer with one electron per site. In a specific range of interlayer hopping, the pairing vertex associated with PDW order becomes more attractive than that for uniform d-wave pairing, although both remain subdominant to the leading antiferromagnetic correlations at half-filling. Our result sheds light on where one potentially may find a PDW state in such a model.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in a ballistic single-channel nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When time-reversal and inversion symmetry are broken, superconducting circuits may exhibit a so-called diode effect, where the critical currents for opposite directions of the current flow differ. In recent years, this effect has been observed in a multitude of systems and the different physical ingredients that may yield such an effect are well understood. On a microscopic level, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and a Zeeman field may give rise to a diode effect in a single Josephson junction. However, so far there is no analytical description of the effect within a simple model. Here we study a single channel nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and subject to a Zeeman field. We show that the different Fermi velocities and spin projections of the two pseudo-spin bands lead to a diode effect. Simple analytical expressions for the efficiency can be obtained in limiting cases.</description>

      <title>The ground state of electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of the electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on cylinders with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). We adopt both periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions along the circumference direction to explore the finite size effect. We study doping levels of $1/6$, $1/8$, and $1/12$ which represent the most interesting region in the phase diagram of electron-doped cuprates. We find that for width-4 and 6 systems, the ground state for fixed doping switches between anti-ferromagnetic Neel state and stripe state under different boundary conditions and with system widths, indicating the presence of large finite size effect in the $t-t'-J$ model. We also have a careful analysis of the $d$-wave pairing correlations which also changes quantitatively with boundary conditions and widths of the system. However, the pairing correlations are enhanced when the system becomes wider for all dopings, suggesting the existence of possible long-ranged superconducting order in the thermodynamic limit. The width-8 results are found to be dependent on the starting state in the DMRG calculation for the kept states we can reach. For width-8 system only Neel (stripe) state can be stabilized in DMRG calculation for $1/12$ ($1/6$) doping, while both stripe and Neel states are stable in the DMRG sweep for $1/8$ doping, regardless of the boundary conditions. These results indicate that $1/8$ doping is likely to lie in the boundary of a phase transition between the Neel phase with lower doping and the stripe phase with higher doping, consistent with the previous study. The sensitivity of ground state on boundary conditions and size observed in this work is similar to that in the $t'$- Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Complete zero-energy flat bands of surface states in fully gapped chiral noncentrosymmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric superconductors can support flat bands of zero-energy surface states in part of their surface Brillouin zone. This requires that they obey time-reversal symmetry and have a sufficiently strong triplet-to-singlet-pairing ratio to exhibit nodal lines in the bulk. These bands are protected by a winding number that relies on chiral symmetry, which is realized as the product of time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry. We reveal a way to stabilize a flat band in the entire surface Brillouin zone, while the bulk dispersion is fully gapped. This idea could lead to a robust platform for quantum computation and represents an alternative route to strongly correlated flat bands in two dimensions, besides twisted bilayer graphene. The necessary ingredient is an additional spin-rotation symmetry that forces the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling vector not to depend on the momentum component normal to the surface. We define a winding number that leads to flat zero-energy surface bands due to bulk-boundary correspondence. We discuss under which conditions this winding number is nonzero in the entire surface Brillouin zone and verify the occurrence of zero-energy surface states by exact numerical diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian for a slab. In addition, we consider how a weak breaking of the additional symmetry affects the surface band, employing first-order perturbation theory and a quasiclassical approximation. We find that the surface states and the bulk gap persist for weak breaking of the additional symmetry but that the band does not remain perfectly flat. The broadening of the band strongly depends on the deviation of the spin-orbit-coupling vector from its unperturbed direction as well as on the spin-orbit-coupling strength and the triplet-pairing amplitude.</description>

      <title>Selective-Area-Grown PbTe-Pb Planar Josephson Junctions for Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are predicted to host Majorana zero modes. The material platforms in previous studies are two dimensional electron gases (InAs, InSb, InAsSb and HgTe) coupled to a superconductor such as Al or Nb. Here, we introduce a new material platform for planar JJs, the PbTe-Pb hybrid. The semiconductor, PbTe, was grown as a thin film via selective area epitaxy. The Josephson junction was defined by a shadow wall during the deposition of the superconductor Pb. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals a sharp semiconductor-superconductor interface. Gate-tunable supercurrent and multiple Andreev reflections are observed. A perpendicular magnetic field causes interference patterns of the switching current, exhibiting Fraunhofer-like and SQUID-like behaviors. We further demonstrate a prototype device for Majorana detection, wherein phase bias and tunneling spectroscopy are applicable.</description>
