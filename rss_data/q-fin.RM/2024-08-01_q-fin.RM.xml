      <title>Enhancing Deep Hedging of Options with Implied Volatility Surface Feedback Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamic hedging scheme for S&amp;P 500 options, where rebalancing decisions are enhanced by integrating information about the implied volatility surface dynamics. The optimal hedging strategy is obtained through a deep policy gradient-type reinforcement learning algorithm, with a novel hybrid neural network architecture improving the training performance. The favorable inclusion of forward-looking information embedded in the volatility surface allows our procedure to outperform several conventional benchmarks such as practitioner and smiled-implied delta hedging procedures, both in simulation and backtesting experiments.</description>

      <title>On the optimal design of a new class of proportional portfolio insurance strategies in a jump-diffusion framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an optimal investment problem associated with proportional portfolio insurance (PPI) strategies in the presence of jumps in the underlying dynamics. PPI strategies enable investors to mitigate downside risk while still retaining the potential for upside gains. This is achieved by maintaining an exposure to risky assets proportional to the difference between the portfolio value and the present value of the guaranteed amount. While PPI strategies are known to be free of downside risk in diffusion modeling frameworks with continuous trading, see e.g., Cont and Tankov (2009), real market applications exhibit a significant non-negligible risk, known as gap risk, which increases with the multiplier value. The goal of this paper is to determine the optimal PPI strategy in a setting where gap risk may occur, due to downward jumps in the asset price dynamics. We consider a loss-averse agent who aims at maximizing the expected utility of the terminal wealth exceeding a minimum guarantee. Technically, we model agent's preferences with an S-shaped utility functions to accommodate the possibility that gap risk occurs, and address the optimization problem via a generalization of the martingale approach that turns to be valid under market incompleteness in a jump-diffusion framework.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Risk Measurement by SV-GARCH-EVT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09434v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to more effectively manage and mitigate stock market risks by accurately characterizing financial market returns and volatility. We enhance the Stochastic Volatility (SV) model by incorporating fat-tailed distributions and leverage effects, estimating model parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. By integrating extreme value theory (EVT) to fit the tail distribution of standard residuals, we develop the SV-EVT-VaR-based dynamic model. Our empirical analysis, using daily S\&amp;P 500 index data and simulated returns, shows that SV-EVT-based models outperform others in backtesting. These models effectively capture the fat-tailed properties of financial returns and the leverage effect, proving superior for out-of-sample data analysis.</description>

      <title>Is the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging a statistical arbitrage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent work of Horikawa and Nakagawa (2024) claims that under a complete market admitting statistical arbitrage, the difference between the hedging position provided by deep hedging and that of the replicating portfolio is a statistical arbitrage. This raises concerns as it entails that deep hedging can include a speculative component aimed simply at exploiting the structure of the risk measure guiding the hedging optimisation problem. We test whether such finding remains true in a GARCH-based market model. We observe that the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging can be a statistical arbitrage if the risk measure considered does not put sufficient relative weight on adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, a suitable choice of risk measure can prevent the deep hedging agent from including a speculative overlay within its hedging strategy.</description>
