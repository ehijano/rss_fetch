      <title>3D-Printed Hybrid Liquid-CPCM Cooling Modules for High-Performance Thermal Management of Lithium-Ion Pouch Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient thermal management is critical for ensuring the safety, performance, and durability of lithium ion pouch cells (LIPCs), particularly under high power operating conditions where conventional battery thermal management systems (BTMS) struggle to balance cooling effectiveness, structural simplicity, and weight. Here, we report a lightweight hybrid BTMS that synergistically integrates active liquid cooling with composite phase change material (CPCM) based thermal buffering through a 3D printed hexagonal architecture. The system is fabricated via a two step additive manufacturing process that enables sealed CPCM encapsulation and isolated liquid cooling pathways within a single carbon fiber reinforced nylon module, effectively eliminating leakage risks while allowing precise geometric control. Hexagonally partitioned CPCM cavities maximize the CPCM wall interfacial area and shorten internal conduction paths, accelerating latent heat absorption, while embedded serpentine liquid channels provide continuous convective heat removal and prevent CPCM saturation. A nanocarbon enhanced CPCM is employed to overcome the intrinsic low thermal conductivity of conventional paraffin based materials.</description>

      <title>Improving Stability Margins with Grid-Forming Damper Winding Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents (i) a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a power system with line dynamics and heterogeneous bus dynamics, (ii) a novel reduced-order model of damper windings in synchronous machines, and (iii) a proportional-derivative (PD) damper winding emulation control for voltage-source converters (VSCs). Damper windings have long been understood to improve the frequency synchronization between machines. However, the dynamics of the damper windings are complex, making them difficult to analyze and directly emulate in the control of VSCs. This paper derives a reduced-order model of the damper windings as a PD term that allows grid-forming controls for VSCs to emulate their effect on frequency dynamics. Next, a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a network with heterogeneous bus dynamics is developed that extends prior results by incorporating line dynamics. Finally, we analytically demonstrate that PD damper winding emulation can improve the stability of grid-forming converter controls. These results are validated with electromagnetic-transient (EMT) simulation.</description>

      <title>i-Socket: Design, Development, and Pilot Evaluation of an Individualized Multi-Material, Multi-Thickness Transtibial Prosthetic Socket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prosthetic socket is an essential part in ensuring comfort and stability for the overall prosthesis system. This study proposes a multi-material/thickness individualized transtibial prosthetic socket that focuses on providing comfort. This study aims to identify the proper material and thickness to protect Calf areas and reduce the pressure around bone areas. First, the socket is divided into four parts depending on the pressure-sensitive/tolerant regions. After identifying the thickness range for each concerned area, the thickness and material are selected based on the Pressure-Pain Threshold (PPT) test, and the finalized design is then prototyped. The prototyped individualized socket (i-Socket) is 22% lighter than the participant's own socket. Results of the pilot experiments with an amputee participant showed that the pressure inside the socket decreased by 45% and 31% for the Tibia and Fibula regions, respectively. Additionally, the self-selected CoM velocity for the walking experiment is increased by 15% compared to the similar studies in the literature. Regarding the kinematic results, symmetry in the knee and ankle joints increased by 65% and 2% when using the i-Socket compared to the results with the participant's own socket.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Evaluation of Attitude Sensor Characteristics Using Microsatellite Flight Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using actual flight data from a 50-cm-class microsatellite whose mission and operations have already been completed, this study re-evaluates satellite attitude determination performance and the error characteristics of onboard attitude sensors. While conventional approaches rely on batch estimation or Kalman filtering based on predefined physical models and white-noise assumptions, this research introduces a machine-learning-based approach to extract and correct structural and nonlinear error patterns embedded in real observational data. In this study, high-quality attitude determination results obtained from star sensors and a fiber optical gyro (FOG) are treated as ground truth, and machine learning is applied to coarse attitude sensor data consisting of Sun sensors and magnetic field sensors. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D) is employed to regressively predict attitude from short sequences of time-series sensor measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using five sets of on-orbit observation logs, with four passes used for training and one independent pass used for testing. The results show that, while conventional coarse attitude determination using the TRIAD method yields attitude errors on the order of 7 deg RMS, the proposed machine-learning approach achieves RMS errors of approximately 0.7 deg for the training data and 2-3 deg for the test data, depending on the sensor combination.</description>

      <title>A Leader-Follower Approach for The Attitude Synchronization of Multiple Rigid Body Systems on $SO(3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the leader-follower attitude synchronization problem for a group of heterogeneous rigid body systems on $SO(3)$ under an undirected, connected, and acyclic graph communication topology. The proposed distributed control strategy, endowed with almost global asymptotic stability guarantees, allows the synchronization of the rigid body systems to a constant desired orientation known only to a single rigid body. Some simulation results are also provided to validate the theoretical developments and illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.</description>

      <title>3D-Printed Passive Reflectors for mmWave Beam Steering via Binary Aperture Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theory-to-hardware framework for fully passive millimeter-wave beam control aimed at extending indoor coverage. The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can provide deterministic beam control and offer a scalable alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor links.</description>

      <title>Dual Analysis of Continuous-time Economic Dispatch and Its Price Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As load varies continuously over time, it is essential to provide continuous-time price signals that accurately reflect supply-demand balance. However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019.</description>

      <title>Structural Monotonicity in Transmission Scheduling for Remote State Estimation with Hidden Channel Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study treats transmission scheduling for remote state estimation over unreliable channels with a hidden mode. A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid BLE-Wi-Fi Communication Architecture for Adaptive Imaging in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is fundamentally constrained by limited wireless bandwidth, resulting in low imaging resolution and frame rate, which can cause motion blur and missed lesions. Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating Bluetooth Low Energy for Ingestible Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely adopted in wearable devices; however, it has not been widely used in ingestible electronics, primarily due to concerns regarding severe tissue attenuation at the 2.4 GHz band. In this work, we systematically reevaluate the feasibility of BLE for ingestible applications by benchmarking its performance against representative sub-GHz communication schemes across power consumption, throughput, tissue-induced attenuation, latency, and system-level integration constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure. Finally, we analyze antenna form factor and ecosystem integration, highlighting the mechanical and translational advantages of BLE in ingestible system design. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BLE, when appropriately configured, represents a compelling and scalable wireless communication solution for next-generation ingestible electronics.</description>

      <title>Output Feedback Stabilization of Linear Systems via Policy Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Eco-Driving Control for Electric Vehicles with Multi-Speed Transmission: Optimizing Vehicle Speed and Powertrain Operation in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an eco-driving algorithm for electric vehicles featuring multi-speed transmissions. The proposed controller is formulated as a co-optimization problem, simultaneously optimizing both vehicle longitudinal speed and powertrain operation to maximize energy efficiency. Constraints derived from a connected vehicle based traffic prediction algorithm are used to ensure traffic safety and smooth traffic flow in dynamic environments with multiple signalized intersections and mixed traffic. By simplifying the complex, nonlinear mixed integer problem, the proposed controller achieves computational efficiency, enabling real-time implementation. To evaluate its performance, traffic scenarios from both Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and real-world road tests are employed. The results demonstrate a notable reduction in energy consumption by up to 11.36\% over an \SI{18}{\km} drive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a clear and rigorous understanding of commonly recognized safety constraints in physical human-robot interaction, i.e. ISO/TS 15066, by examining how they are obtained and which assumptions support them. We clarify the interpretation and practical impact of key simplifying assumptions, show how these modeling choices affect both safety and performance across the system, and indicate specific design parameters that can be adjusted in safety-critical control implementations. Numerical examples are provided to quantify performance degradation induced by common approximations and simplifying design choices. Furthermore, the fundamental role of energy in safety assessment is emphasized, and focused insights are offered on the existing body of work concerning energy-based safety methodologies.</description>

      <title>Improved Initialization for Port-Hamiltonian Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian neural networks have shown promising results in the identification of nonlinear dynamics of complex systems, as their combination of physical principles with data-driven learning allows for accurate modelling. However, due to the non-convex optimization problem inherent in learning the correct network parameters, the training procedure is prone to converging to local minima, potentially leading to poor performance. In order to avoid this issue, this paper proposes an improved initialization for port-Hamiltonian neural networks. The core idea is to first estimate a linear port-Hamiltonian system to be used as an initialization for the network, after which the neural network adapts to the system nonlinearities, reducing the training times and improving convergence. The effectiveness of this method is tested on a chained mass-spring-damper setup for varying noise levels and compared to the original approach.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Predictive Control for Wide-Area Power Oscillation Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study damping of inter-area oscillations in transmission grids using voltage-source-converter-based high-voltage direct-current (VSC-HVDC) links. Conventional power oscillation damping controllers rely on system models that are difficult to obtain in practice. Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) addresses this limitation by replacing explicit models with data. We apply AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictive control and its Transient Predictive Control (TPC) variant, and compare them with Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and two standard model-based controllers. The methods are evaluated in simulation on a system exhibiting both inter-area and local oscillation modes. ARX-based predictive control and DeePC both achieve effective damping, while the ARX-based methods require less online computation. Using warm-started, pre-factorized operator-splitting solvers, ARX/TPC control actions are computed in less than 1ms. These results demonstrate that DPC is a viable approach for power-system oscillation damping for the given test case.</description>

      <title>Frequency Shaping Control for Oscillation Damping in Weakly-Connected Power Network: A Root Locus Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency control following a contingency event is of vital concern in power system operations. Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method. Numerical simulations validate the proposed tuning for FS as well as the superiority of FS over VI in exponential convergence rate.</description>

      <title>A Latent Space Framework for Modeling Transient Engine Emissions Using Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling and controlling vehicle exhaust emissions during transient events, such as rapid acceleration, is critical for meeting environmental regulations and optimizing powertrains. Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains. These findings offer a clear pathway toward more robust emission control systems for next-generation vehicles.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Control Bellman Residual Minimization for Markov Decision Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.</description>

      <title>A Switching Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Strategy for Safe Collision Handling by an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For active intervention tasks in underwater environments, the use of autonomous vehicles is just now emerging as an active area of research. During operation, for various reasons, the robot might find itself on a collision course with an obstacle in its environment. In this paper, a switching Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy is proposed to safely handle collisions for an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS). When avoiding the collision is impossible, the control algorithm takes advantage of the manipulator, using it to push against the obstacle, and deflect away from the collision. Virtual experiments are performed to demonstrate the algorithm's capability to successfully detect collisions and either avoid them, or use the manipulator to handle them appropriately without damaging sensitive areas of the vehicle.</description>

      <title>When Does Adaptation Win? Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $&gt;40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</description>

      <title>FTA-NTN: Fairness and Throughput Assurance in Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing optimal non-terrestrial network (NTN) constellations is essential for maximizing throughput and ensuring fair resource distribution. This paper presents FTA-NTN (Fairness and Throughput Assurance in Non-Terrestrial Networks), a multi-objective optimization framework that jointly maximizes throughput and fairness under realistic system constraints. The framework integrates multi-layer Walker Delta constellations, a parametric mobility model for user distributions across Canadian land regions, adaptive K-Means clustering for beamforming and user association, and Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning. Simulation results with 500 users show that FTA-NTN achieves over 9.88 Gbps of aggregate throughput with an average fairness of 0.42, corresponding to an optimal configuration of 9 planes with 15 satellites per plane in LEO and 7 planes with 3 satellites per plane in MEO. These values align with 3GPP NTN evaluation scenarios and representative system assumptions, confirming their relevance for realistic deployments. Overall, FTA-NTN demonstrates that throughput and fairness can be jointly optimized under practical constraints, advancing beyond throughput-centric designs in the literature and offering a scalable methodology for next-generation NTN deployments that supports efficient and equitable global connectivity.</description>

      <title>Passive Daytime Radiative Cooling Enabled by Bio-Derived Ceramic-Polymer Coatings on Rapid-Curing Fiberglass Casts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) provides an energy-free approach to suppress surface temperatures by reflecting solar irradiation while emitting thermal radiation through the mid-infrared atmospheric window. Despite rapid progress in optical performance, most PDRC systems remain limited by rigid, fragile, or planar substrates, restricting their use on flexible, curved, or wearable surfaces. Here, we report a biocompatible and structurally robust PDRC system integrated onto a commercial rapid-curing fiberglass cast, a conformal substrate widely used in orthopedic and industrial applications. The cooling architecture adopts a bilayer polymer design consisting of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) adhesion layer and a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protective layer, both embedded with calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) ceramic particles derived from processed animal bone waste. The bio-derived CPP simultaneously enables broadband solar scattering and high mid-infrared emittance, while offering sustainability and biocompatibility advantages. The resulting composite exhibits over 90% solar reflectance and achieves up to 15 C sub-ambient cooling under direct outdoor sunlight.</description>

Abstract: This paper summarizes the opportunities of in-network collective operations (INC) for accelerated collective operations in AI workloads. We provide sufficient detail to make this important field accessible to non-experts in AI or networking, fostering a connection between these communities. Consider two types of INC: Edge-INC, where the system is implemented at the node level, and Core-INC, where the system is embedded within network switches. We outline the potential performance benefits as well as six key obstacles in the context of both Edge-INC and Core-INC that may hinder their adoption. Finally, we present a set of predictions for the future development and application of INC.</description>

      <title>LightSBB-M: Bridging Schr\"odinger and Bass for Generative Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/alexouadi/LightSBB-M.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Path Planning in Unstructured Environments via Global-Guided Differentiable Hard Constraint Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying deep learning agents for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments faces critical challenges regarding safety, data scarcity, and limited computational resources. Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

      <title>On the rarity of rocket-driven Penrose extraction in Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific "sweet spot," success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\eta_{\rm cum} \approx 19\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

Abstract: We present SCOPE, a fast and efficient framework for modeling and manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs). Unlike conventional energy-based approaches, SCOPE leverages convex approximations to significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining smooth and physically plausible deformations. This trade-off between speed and accuracy makes the method particularly suitable for applications requiring real-time or near-real-time response. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation experiments, highlighting its ability to generate smooth shape trajectories under geometric and length constraints.</description>

      <title>Component-Aware Pruning Framework for Neural Network Controllers via Gradient-Based Importance Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic to multi-component neural architectures in advanced neural network controllers poses substantial challenges due to the high computational complexity of the latter. Conventional model compression techniques for complexity reduction, such as structured pruning based on norm-based metrics to estimate the relative importance of distinct parameter groups, often fail to capture functional significance. This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty. Experimental results with an autoencoder and a TD-MPC agent demonstrate that the proposed framework reveals critical structural dependencies and dynamic shifts in importance that static heuristics often miss, supporting more informed compression decisions.</description>

      <title>A refined nonlinear least-squares method for the rational approximation problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational approximation is a widely used method for the efficient construction of highly accurate rational approximations to given data. While AAA can often produce rational approximations accurate to any prescribed tolerance, these approximations may have degrees larger than what is actually required to meet the given tolerance. In this work, we consider the adaptive construction of interpolating rational approximations while aiming for the smallest feasible degree to satisfy a given error tolerance. To this end, we introduce refinement approaches to the linear least-squares step of the classical AAA algorithm that aim to minimize the true nonlinear least-squares error with respect to the given data. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the derived approaches in terms of the corresponding gradients from the resulting minimization problems and use these insights to propose a new greedy framework that ensures monotonic error convergence. Numerical examples from function approximation and model order reduction verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to construct accurate rational approximations of small degrees.</description>

      <title>An advanced 1D physics-based model for PEM hydrogen fuel cells with enhanced overvoltage prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A one-dimensional, dynamic, two-phase, isothermal model of proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems using a finite-difference approach has been developed. This model balances the simplicity of lumped-parameter models with the detailed accuracy of computational fluid dynamics models, offering precise internal state descriptions with low computational demand. The model's static behavior is validated experimentally using polarization curves. In addition, a novel physical parameter, the limit liquid water saturation coefficient ($s_{\rm lim}$), is introduced in the overvoltage calculation, replacing the traditional limit current density coefficient ($i_{\rm lim}$). This new parameter links the voltage drop at high current densities to the amount of liquid water present in the catalyst layers and the operating conditions of the fuel cell. Additionally, it has been observed that $s_{\rm lim}$ is influenced at least by the gas pressure applied by the operator. This newly established link is promising for optimizing the control and thereby improving the performance of fuel cells.</description>

      <title>AlphaPEM: an open-source dynamic 1D physics-based PEM fuel cell model for embedded applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The urgency of the energy transition requires improving the performance and longevity of hydrogen technologies. AlphaPEM is a dynamic one-dimensional (1D) physics-based PEM fuel cell system simulator, programmed in Python and experimentally validated. It offers a good balance between accuracy and execution speed. The modular architecture allows for addition of new features, and it has a user-friendly graphical interface. An automatic calibration method is proposed to match the model to the studied fuel cell. The software provides information on the internal states of the system in response to any current density and can produce polarization and EIS curves. AlphaPEM facilitates the use of a model in embedded conditions, allowing real-time modification of the fuel cell's operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Contact Plan Design for Cross-Linked GNSSs: An ILP Approach for Extended Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) employ inter-satellite links (ISLs) to reduce dependency on ground stations, enabling precise ranging and communication across satellites. Beyond their traditional role, ISLs can support extended applications, including providing navigation and communication services to external entities. However, designing effective contact plan design (CPD) schemes for these multifaceted ISLs, operating under a polling time-division duplex (PTDD) framework, remains a critical challenge. Existing CPD approaches focus solely on meeting GNSS satellites' internal ranging and communication demands, neglecting their extended applications. This paper introduces the first CPD scheme capable of supporting extended GNSS ISLs. By modeling GNSS requirements and designing a tailored service process, our approach ensures the allocation of essential resources for internal operations while accommodating external user demands. Based on the BeiDou constellation, simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme's efficacy in maintaining core GNSS functionality while providing extended ISLs on a best-effort basis. Additionally, the results highlight the significant impact of GNSS ISLs in enhancing orbit determination and clock synchronization for the Earth-Moon libration point constellation, underscoring the importance of extended GNSS ISL applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Flatness-Preserving Residuals for Pure-Feedback Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study residual dynamics learning for differentially flat systems, where a nominal model is augmented with a learned correction term from data. A key challenge is that generic residual parameterizations may destroy flatness, limiting the applicability of flatness-based planning and control methods. To address this, we propose a framework for learning flatness-preserving residual dynamics in systems whose nominal model admits a pure-feedback form. We show that residuals with a lower-triangular structure preserve both the flatness of the system and the original flat outputs. Moreover, we provide a constructive procedure to recover the flatness diffeomorphism of the augmented system from that of the nominal model. Building on these insights, we introduce a parameterization of flatness-preserving residuals using smooth function approximators, making them learnable from trajectory data with conventional algorithms. Our approach is validated in simulation on a 2D quadrotor subject to unmodeled aerodynamic effects. We demonstrate that the resulting learned flat model achieves a tracking error $5\times$ lower than the nominal flat model, while being $20\times$ faster over a structure-agnostic alternative.</description>

      <title>Fine Tuning a Simulation-Driven Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many industries now deploy high-fidelity simulators (digital twins) to represent physical systems, yet their parameters must be calibrated to match the true system. This motivated the construction of simulation-driven parameter estimators, built by generating synthetic observations for sampled parameter values and learning a supervised mapping from observations to parameters. However, when the true parameters lie outside the sampled range, predictions suffer from an out-of-distribution (OOD) error. This paper introduces a fine-tuning approach for the Two-Stage estimator that mitigates OOD effects and improves accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>DPLib: A Standard Benchmark Library for Distributed Power System Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure, making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib, available at \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DPLib.git}{GitHub}, fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20 multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Z Transform Laplace Inversion: To Correct flaws in Signal and System Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation. This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t = 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform, aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.</description>

      <title>Monotone Neural Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a neurosymbolic framework for safety verification and control synthesis in high-dimensional monotone dynamical systems without relying on explicit models or conservative Lipschitz bounds. The approach combines the expressiveness of neural networks with the rigor of symbolic reasoning via barrier certificates, functional analogs of inductive invariants that formally guarantee safety. Prior data-driven methods often treat dynamics as black-box models, relying on dense state-space discretization or Lipschitz overapproximations, leading to exponential sample complexity. In contrast, monotonicity--a pervasive structural property in many real-world systems--provides a symbolic scaffold that simplifies both learning and verification. Exploiting order preservation reduces verification to localized boundary checks, transforming a high-dimensional problem into a tractable, low-dimensional one. Barrier certificates are synthesized using monotone neural network architectures with embedded monotonicity constraints--trained via gradient-based optimization guided by barrier conditions. This enables scalable, formally sound verification directly from simulation data, bridging black-box learning and formal guarantees within a unified neurosymbolic framework.</description>

      <title>Ruggedized Ultrasound Sensing in Harsh Conditions: eRTIS in the wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present eRTIS, a rugged, embedded ultrasound sensing system for use in harsh industrial environments. The system features a broadband capacitive transducer and a 32-element MEMS microphone array capable of 2D and 3D beamforming. A modular hardware architecture separates sensing and processing tasks: a high-performance microcontroller handles excitation signal generation and data acquisition, while an NVIDIA Jetson module performs GPU-accelerated signal processing. eRTIS supports external synchronization via a custom controller that powers and coordinates up to six devices, either simultaneously or in a defined sequence. Additional synchronization options include bidirectional triggering and in-band signal injection. A sealed, anodized aluminum enclosure with passive cooling and IP-rated connectors ensures reliability in challenging conditions. Performance is demonstrated in three field scenarios: harbor mooring, off-road robotics, and autonomous navigation in cluttered environments, demonstrates that eRTIS provides robust sensing in situations where optical systems degrade.</description>

      <title>Hill-Type Stability Analysis of Periodic Solutions of Fractional-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores stability properties of periodic solutions of (nonlinear) fractional-order differential equations (FODEs). As classical Caputo-type FODEs do not admit exactly periodic solutions, we propose a framework of Liouville-Weyl-type FODEs, which do admit exactly periodic solutions and are an extension of Caputo-type FODEs. Local linearization around a periodic solution results in perturbation dynamics governed by a linear time-periodic differential equation. In the classical integer-order case, the perturbation dynamics is therefore described by Floquet theory, i.e. the exponential growth or decay of perturbations is expressed by Floquet exponents which can be assessed using the Hill matrix approach. For fractional-order systems, however, a rigorous Floquet theory is lacking. Here, we explore the limitations when trying to extend Floquet theory and the Hill matrix method to linear time-periodic fractional-order differential equations (LTP-FODEs) as local linearization of nonlinear fractional-order systems. A key result of the paper is that such an extended Floquet theory can only assess exponentially growing solutions of LTP-FODEs. Moreover, we provide an analysis of linear time-invariant fractional-order systems (LTI-FODEs) with algebraically decaying solutions and show that the inaccessibility of decaying solutions through Floquet theory is already present in the time-invariant case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article develops an optical navigation (OPNAV) and station-keeping pipeline for the near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) in high-fidelity ephemeris model dynamics, using synthetic images in a non-iterative horizon-based OPNAV algorithm, applying the result in a navigation filter, and using the obtained estimates in a station-keeping control scheme that keeps the spacecraft in the vicinity of a reference orbit. We study differential correction-based and minimization-based implementations of the so-called x-axis crossing control scheme, and propose an improved targeting prediction scheme by incorporating the filter's state covariance with an unscented transform. We also introduce a hysteresis mechanism, which improves station-keeping cost and provides insight into the difference in performance between the differential correction-based and minimization-based approaches. We perform Monte-Carlo experiments to assess the pipeline's tracking and {\Delta}V performances. We report several key findings, including the variability of the filter performance with the sensor field of view and measurement locations, station-keeping cost reduction achieved by the unscented transform-based prediction and hysteresis, as well as the variability of the cumulative {\Delta}V as a function of maneuver location due to the periodic structure in the OPNAV-based filter's estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cloud and AI Infrastructure Cost Optimization: A Comprehensive Review of Strategies and Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations manage their IT infrastructure, but it has also introduced new challenges, such as managing cloud costs. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads has further amplified these challenges, with GPU compute now representing 40-60\% of technical budgets for AI-focused organizations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of cloud and AI infrastructure cost optimization techniques, covering traditional cloud pricing models, resource allocation strategies, and emerging approaches for managing AI/ML workloads. We examine the dramatic cost reductions in large language model (LLM) inference which has decreased by approximately 10x annually since 2021 and explore techniques such as model quantization, GPU instance selection, and inference optimization. Real-world case studies from Amazon Prime Video, Pinterest, Cloudflare, and Netflix showcase practical application of these techniques. Our analysis reveals that organizations can achieve 50-90% cost savings through strategic optimization approaches. Future research directions in automated optimization, sustainability, and AI-specific cost management are proposed to advance the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy-based learning algorithms are alternatives to backpropagation and are well-suited to distributed implementations in analog electronic devices. However, a rigorous theory of convergence is lacking. We make a first step in this direction by analysing a particular energybased learning algorithm, Contrastive Learning, applied to a network of linear adjustable resistors. It is shown that, in this setup, Contrastive Learning is equivalent to projected gradient descent on a convex function with Lipschitz continuous gradient, giving a guarantee of convergence of the algorithm for a range of stepsizes. This convergence result is then extended to a stochastic variant of Contrastive Learning.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance of a Keyhole-based Multi-user System with Multiple Eavesdroppers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy performance of a keyhole-aided multi-user communication network in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The communication happens through the same keyhole for legitimate users and eavesdroppers. In this context, the secrecy performance is evaluated for a user scheduling technique by obtaining the exact closed-form expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP). Further, a simplified asymptotic SOP expression is derived assuming high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario for a better understanding of the impact of system parameters. The effect of the keyhole parameters, number of users, number of eavesdroppers, and threshold secrecy rate on the SOP performance are also investigated for the considered system model. In the high-SNR regime, the asymptotic SOP saturates to a constant value and does not depend on the keyhole parameter and the channel parameter of the source-to-keyhole channel.</description>

      <title>Specifying and Verifying RDMA Synchronisation (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote direct memory access (RDMA) allows a machine to directly read from and write to the memory of remote machine, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data transfer. Ensuring correctness of RDMA programs has only recently become possible with the formalisation of $\text{RDMA}^\text{TSO}$ semantics (describing the behaviour of RDMA networking over a TSO CPU). However, this semantics currently lacks a formalisation of remote synchronisation, meaning that the implementations of common abstractions such as locks cannot be verified. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting $\text{RDMA}^{\text{TSO}}_{\text{RMW}}$, the first semantics for remote `read-modify-write' (RMW) instructions over TSO. It turns out that remote RMW operations are weak and only ensure atomicity against other remote RMWs. We therefore build a set of composable synchronisation abstractions starting with the $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$ library. Underpinned by $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$, we then specify, implement and verify three classes of remote locks that are suitable for different scenarios. Additionally, we develop the notion of a strong RDMA model, $\text{RDMA}^{\text{SC}}_{\text{RMW}}$, which is akin to sequential consistency in shared memory architectures. Our libraries are built to be compatible with an existing set of high-performance libraries called LOCO, which ensures compositionality and verifiability.</description>
