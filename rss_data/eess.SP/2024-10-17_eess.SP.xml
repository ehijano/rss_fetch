      <title>Exploring Dual-Sniffer Passive Localization: Algorithm Design and Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a dual-sniffer passive localization system that detects the timing difference of signals from both commercial base station (eNb) and user equipment (UE) to the sniffers. We design two localization schemes for UE localization: a time of arrival (ToA) based scheme and a time difference of arrival (TDoA) based scheme. In the ToA-based scheme, we derive two ellipse equations from measured arrival times at two sniffers, enabling direct numerical computation of the estimated position. For the TDoA-based scheme, we relocate one sniffer to a different position to obtain two sets of TDoA measurements, resulting in hyperbola equations. We then apply a least squares (LS) algorithm to analytically estimate the UE's position. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed TDoA-based scheme, demonstrating improved accuracy in UE positioning.We build a platform based on the considered localization system and conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results confirm the accuracy and practicality of the TDoA-based dual-sniffer localization scheme, demonstrating improved precision in passive localization.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Distortion Resistant Orientation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, are used to estimate the orientation of mobile devices. However, indoor magnetic fields are often distorted, causing the magnetometer's readings to deviate from true north and resulting in inaccurate orientation estimates. Existing solutions either ignore magnetic distortion or avoid using the magnetometer when distortion is detected. In this paper, we develop MDR, a Magnetic Distortion Resistant orientation estimation system that fundamentally models and corrects magnetic distortion. MDR builds a database to record magnetic directions at different locations and uses it to correct orientation estimates affected by magnetic distortion. To avoid the overhead of database preparation, MDR adopts practical designs to automatically update the database in parallel with orientation estimation. Experiments on 27+ hours of arm motion data show that MDR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 35.34%.</description>

      <title>When atomic norm meets the G-filter: A general framework for line spectral estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for line spectral estimation which combines Georgiou's filter bank (G-filter) with atomic norm minimization (ANM). A key ingredient is a Carath\'{e}odory--Fej\'{e}r-type decomposition for the covariance matrix of the filter output. The resulting optimization problem can be characterized via semidefinite programming and contains the standard ANM for line spectral estimation as a special case. Simulations show that our approach outperforms the standard ANM in terms of recovering the number of spectral lines when the signal-to-noise ratio is no lower than 0 dB and the G-filter is suitably designed.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Design, and Verification of An Active Transmissive RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a promising technology that may effectively improve the quality of signals in wireless communications. In practice, however, the ``double fading'' effect undermines the application of RIS and constitutes a significant challenge to its commercialization. To address this problem, we present a novel 2-bit programmable amplifying transmissive RIS with a power amplification function to enhance the transmission of electromagnetic signals. The transmissive function is achieved through a pair of radiation patches located on the upper and lower surfaces, respectively, while a microstrip line connects two patches. A power amplifier, SP4T switch, and directional coupler provide signal amplification and a 2-bit phase shift. To characterize the signal enhancement of active transmissive RIS, we propose a dual radar cross section (RCS)-based path loss model to predict the power of the received signal for active transmissive RIS-aided wireless communication systems.
  Simulation and experimental results verify the reliability of the RIS design, and the proposed path loss model is validated by measurements. Compared with the traditional passive RIS, the signal power gain in this design achieves 11.9 dB.</description>

      <title>Line Spectral Analysis Using the G-Filter: An Atomic Norm Minimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The area of spectral analysis has a traditional dichotomy between continuous spectra (spectral densities) which correspond to purely nondeterministic processes, and line spectra (Dirac impulses) which represent sinusoids. While the former case is important in the identification of discrete-time linear stochastic systems, the latter case is essential for the analysis and modeling of time series with notable applications in radar systems. In this paper, we develop a novel approach for line spectral estimation which combines ideas of Georgiou's filter banks (G-filters) and atomic norm minimization (ANM), a mainstream method for line spectral analysis in the last decade following the theory of compressed sensing. Such a combination is only possible because a Carath\'{e}odory--Fej\'{e}r-type decomposition is available for the covariance matrix of the filter output. The ANM problem can be characterized via semidefinite programming which can be solved efficiently. As a consequence, our optimization theory can be seen as a substantial generalization of the standard ANM for line spectral estimation. Moreover, our ANM approach with a G-filter has significant advantages over subspace methods because it can work with just one output vector and without \emph{a priori} knowledge about the number of sinusoids in the input. Simulation results show that our approach performs reasonably well under different signal-to-noise ratios when the G-filter is suitably designed.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing using Deep Reinforcement Learning in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of devices getting connected to the vehicular network grows exponentially, addressing the numerous challenges of effectively allocating spectrum in dynamic vehicular environment becomes increasingly difficult. Traditional methods may not suffice to tackle this issue. In vehicular networks safety critical messages are involved and it is important to implement an efficient spectrum allocation paradigm for hassle free communication as well as manage the congestion in the network. To tackle this, a Deep Q Network (DQN) model is proposed as a solution, leveraging its ability to learn optimal strategies over time and make decisions. The paper presents a few results and analyses, demonstrating the efficacy of the DQN model in enhancing spectrum sharing efficiency. Deep Reinforcement Learning methods for sharing spectrum in vehicular networks have shown promising outcomes, demonstrating the system's ability to adjust to dynamic communication environments. Both SARL and MARL models have exhibited successful rates of V2V communication, with the cumulative reward of the RL model reaching its maximum as training progresses.</description>

      <title>Design of Fiber-Longitudinal Optical Power Monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents analytical results on the accuracy of fiber-longitudinal optical power monitoring (LPM) at arbitrary positions. To quantify the accuracy, the position-wise variance and power-profile SNR of LPM are defined and analyzed, yielding formulas for these metrics. Using these metrics, we show that various designs and performance predictions of LPM for a given link and estimation conditions are possible in a unified manner. Specifically, the required SNR to detect a given loss event is first presented. Based on this, the design parameters of LPM, such as the sample size and optical power required to detect the loss, are explicitly determined. The performance such as the detectable limit of loss events at individual positions and maximum dynamic range are also specified. These results can be used as a basis for establishing a design principle of LPM.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming Design for ISAC with Sensor-Aided Active RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can improve the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and therefore enable simultaneous data transmission and target sensing. However, when the line-of-sight (LoS) link between the base station and the sensing target is blocked, the sensing signals suffer from severe path loss, resulting in an inferior sensing performance. To address this issue, this paper employs a sensor-aided active RIS to enhance ISAC system performance. The goal is to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the echo signal from the target at the sensor-array while meeting constraints on communication signal quality, power budgets, and RIS amplification limits. The optimization problem is challenging due to its non-convex nature and the coupling between the optimization variables. We propose a closed-form solution for receive beamforming, and a successive convex approximation based iterative method for transmit and reflection beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed sensor-aided active RIS-assisted system model over its non-sensor-aided counterpart.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Rate Splitting Approach in RIS-Aided Systems Based on Channel Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) are two prospective technologies for improving the spectral and energy efficiency in future wireless communication systems. In this work, we investigate a rate splitting (RS) technique for an RIS-aided system in the presence of only statistical channel knowledge. We propose an algorithm with a quasi closed-form solution based only on the second-order channel statistics, which reduces the design complexity of the system as it does not require estimation of the channel state information (CSI) and optimisation of the precoding filters and phase shifts of the RIS in every channel coherence interval.</description>

      <title>DRIP: A Versatile Family of Space-Time ISAC Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following paper introduces Dual beam-similarity awaRe Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) with controlled Peak-to-average power ratio (DRIP) waveforms. DRIP is a novel family of space-time ISAC waveforms designed for dynamic peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) adjustment. The proposed DRIP waveforms are designed to conform to specified PAPR levels while exhibiting beampattern properties, effectively targeting multiple desired directions and suppressing interference for multi-target sensing applications, while closely resembling radar chirps. For communication purposes, the proposed DRIP waveforms aim to minimize multi-user interference across various constellations. Addressing the non-convexity of the optimization framework required for generating DRIP waveforms, we introduce a block cyclic coordinate descent algorithm. This iterative approach ensures convergence to an optimal ISAC waveform solution. Simulation results validate the DRIP waveforms' superior performance, versatility, and favorable ISAC trade-offs, highlighting their potential in advanced multi-target sensing and communication systems.</description>

      <title>CSI-Based Efficient Self-Quarantine Monitoring System Using Branchy Convolution Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic because of its fast spread in various countries. To build an anti-epidemic barrier, self-isolation is required for people who have been to any at-risk places or have been in close contact with infected people. However, existing camera or wearable device-based monitoring systems may present privacy leakage risks or cause user inconvenience in some cases. In this paper, we propose a Wi-Fi-based device-free self-quarantine monitoring system. Specifically, we exploit channel state information (CSI) derived from Wi-Fi signals as human activity features. We collect CSI data in a simulated self-quarantine scenario and present BranchyGhostNet, a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN) with an early exit prediction branch, for the efficient joint task of room occupancy detection (ROD) and human activity recognition (HAR). The early exiting branch is used for ROD, and the final one is used for HAR. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed model can achieve an average accuracy of 98.19% for classifying five different human activities. They also confirm that after leveraging the early exit prediction mechanism, the inference latency for ROD can be significantly reduced by 54.04% when compared with the final exiting branch while guaranteeing the accuracy of ROD.</description>

      <title>EmotionCaps: Enhancing Audio Captioning Through Emotion-Augmented Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in audio-language modeling, such as automated audio captioning, has benefited from training on synthetic data generated with the aid of large-language models. However, such approaches for environmental sound captioning have primarily focused on audio event tags and have not explored leveraging emotional information that may be present in recordings. In this work, we explore the benefit of generating emotion-augmented synthetic audio caption data by instructing ChatGPT with additional acoustic information in the form of estimated soundscape emotion. To do so, we introduce EmotionCaps, an audio captioning dataset comprised of approximately 120,000 audio clips with paired synthetic descriptions enriched with soundscape emotion recognition (SER) information. We hypothesize that this additional information will result in higher-quality captions that match the emotional tone of the audio recording, which will, in turn, improve the performance of captioning models trained with this data. We test this hypothesis through both objective and subjective evaluation, comparing models trained with the EmotionCaps dataset to multiple baseline models. Our findings challenge current approaches to captioning and suggest new directions for developing and assessing captioning models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing IoT Communication and Localization via Smarter Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of sensing and communication functionalities is poised to become a pivotal feature of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. This vision represents a paradigm shift in wireless network design, moving beyond mere communication to a holistic integration of sensing and communication capabilities, thereby further narrowing the gap between the physical and digital worlds. While Internet of Things (IoT) devices are integral to future wireless networks, their current capabilities in sensing and communication are constrained by their power and resource limitations. On one hand, their restricted power budget limits their transmission power, leading to reduced communication range and data rates. On the other hand, their limited hardware and processing abilities hinder the adoption of sophisticated sensing technologies, such as direction finding and localization. In this work, we introduce Wi-Pro, a system which seamlessly integrates today's WiFi protocol with smart antenna design to enhance the communication and sensing capabilities of existing IoT devices. This plug-and-play system can be easily installed by replacing the IoT device's antenna. Wi-Pro seamlessly integrates smart antenna hardware with current WiFi protocols, utilizing their inherent features to not only enhance communication but also to enable precise localization on low-cost IoT devices. Our evaluation results demonstrate that Wi-Pro achieves up to 150\% data rate improvement, up to five times range improvement, accurate direction finding, and localization on single-chain IoT devices.</description>

      <title>AI-Aided Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.</description>

      <title>Mean Field-based Dynamic Backoff Optimization for MIMO-enabled Grant-Free NOMA in Massive IoT Networks</title>

Abstract: In the 6G Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, unprecedented challenges will be raised to provide massive connectivity, ultra-low latency, and energy efficiency for ultra-dense IoT devices. To address these challenges, we explore the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based grant-free random access (GFRA) schemes in the cellular uplink to support massive IoT devices with high spectrum efficiency and low access latency. In particular, we focus on optimizing the backoff strategy of each device when transmitting time-sensitive data samples to a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-enabled base station subject to energy constraints. To cope with the dynamic varied channel and the severe uplink interference due to the uncoordinated grant-free access, we formulate the optimization problem as a multi-user non-cooperative dynamic stochastic game (MUN-DSG). To avoid dimensional disaster as the device number grows large, the optimization problem is transformed into a mean field game (MFG), and its Nash equilibrium can be achieved by solving the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. Thus, a Mean Field-based Dynamic Backoff (MFDB) scheme is proposed as the optimal GFRA solution for each device. Extensive simulation has been fulfilled to compare the proposed MFDB with contemporary random access approaches like access class barring (ACB), slotted-Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area (ALOHA), and minimum backoff (MB) under both static and dynamic channels, and the results proved that MFDB can achieve the least access delay and cumulated cost during multiple transmission frames.

      <title>Beyond Speech and More: Investigating the Emergent Ability of Speech Foundation Models for Classifying Physiological Time-Series Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being trained exclusively on speech data, speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper have shown impressive performance in non-speech tasks such as audio classification. This is partly because speech shares some common traits with audio, enabling SFMs to transfer effectively. In this study, we push the boundaries by evaluating SFMs on a more challenging out-of-domain (OOD) task: classifying physiological time-series signals. We test two key hypotheses: first, that SFMs can generalize to physiological signals by capturing shared temporal patterns; second, that multilingual SFMs will outperform others due to their exposure to greater variability during pre-training, leading to more robust, generalized representations. Our experiments, conducted for stress recognition using ECG (Electrocardiogram), EMG (Electromyography), and EDA (Electrodermal Activity) signals, reveal that models trained on SFM-derived representations outperform those trained on raw physiological signals. Among all models, multilingual SFMs achieve the highest accuracy, supporting our hypothesis and demonstrating their OOD capabilities. This work positions SFMs as promising tools for new uncharted domains beyond speech.</description>

      <title>Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints (~100) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 10% and 42%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</description>

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Myopathy present considerable challenges in the realm of neuromuscular disorder diagnostics. In this study, we employ advanced deep-learning techniques to address the detection of ALS and Myopathy, two debilitating conditions. Our methodology begins with the extraction of informative features from raw electromyography (EMG) signals, leveraging the Log-spectrum, and Delta Log spectrum, which capture the frequency contents, and spectral and temporal characteristics of the signals. Subsequently, we applied a deep-learning model, SpectroEMG-Net, combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Attention for the classification of three classes. The robustness of our approach is rigorously evaluated, demonstrating its remarkable performance in distinguishing among the classes: Myopathy, Normal, and ALS, with an outstanding overall accuracy of 92\%. This study marks a contribution to addressing the diagnostic challenges posed by neuromuscular disorders through a data-driven, multi-class classification approach, providing valuable insights into the potential for early and accurate detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Myopathy are debilitating neuromuscular disorders that demand accurate and efficient diagnostic approaches. In this study, we harness the power of deep learning techniques to detect ALS and Myopathy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in this context. We present ResEMGNet, designed to identify ALS and Myopathy directly from raw electromyography (EMG) signals. Unlike traditional methods that require intricate handcrafted feature extraction, ResEMGNet takes raw EMG data as input, reducing computational complexity and enhancing practicality. Our approach was rigorously evaluated using various metrics in comparison to existing methods. ResEMGNet exhibited exceptional subject-independent performance, achieving an impressive overall three-class accuracy of 94.43\%.</description>

      <title>GBSense: A GHz-Bandwidth Compressed Spectrum Sensing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents GBSense, an innovative compressed spectrum sensing system designed for GHz-bandwidth signals. GBSense introduces a novel approach to realize periodic nonuniform sampling that efficiently captures wideband signals using significantly lower sampling rates compared to traditional Nyquist sampling. The system incorporates time-interleaved analog-to-digital conversion, which eliminates the need for the complex analog delays typically required in multicoset sampling architectures, and offers real-time adjustable sampling patterns. The hardware design includes a dedicated clock distribution circuit and the implementation of a standard protocol to ensure precise synchronization of nonuniform samples. GBSense can process signals with a 2 GHz radio frequency bandwidth using only a 400 MHz average sampling rate. Lab tests demonstrate 100\% accurate spectrum reconstruction when the spectrum occupancy is below 100 MHz and over 80\% accuracy for occupancy up to 200 MHz. Additionally, an integrated system built around the GBSense core and a low-power Raspberry Pi processor achieves a low processing latency of around 30 ms per frame, showcasing strong real-time performance. This work highlights the potential of GBSense as a high-efficiency solution for dynamic spectrum access in future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Network-Level Integrated Sensing and Communication: Interference Management and BS Coordination Using Stochastic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks with the aim of effectively balancing sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Focusing on monostatic sensing, the tool of stochastic geometry is exploited to capture the S&amp;C performance, which facilitates us to illuminate key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network and optimize key network-level parameters. Based on the derived tractable expression of area spectral efficiency (ASE), we formulate the optimization problem to maximize the network performance from the view point of two joint S&amp;C metrics. Towards this end, we further jointly optimize the cooperative BS cluster sizes for S&amp;C and the serving/probing numbers of users/targets to achieve a flexible tradeoff between S&amp;C at the network level. It is verified that interference nulling can effectively improve the average data rate and radar information rate. Surprisingly, the optimal communication tradeoff for the case of the ASE maximization tends to employ all spacial resources towards multiplexing and diversity gain, without interference nulling. By contrast, for the sensing objectives, resource allocation tends to eliminate certain interference especially when the antenna resources are sufficient, because the inter-cell interference becomes a more dominant factor affecting sensing performance. Furthermore, we prove that the ratio of the optimal number of users and the number of transmit antennas is a constant value when the communication performance is optimal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative ISAC scheme achieves a substantial gain in S&amp;C performance at the network level.</description>
