      <title>Analysis of multistability in discrete quantum droplets and bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the existence and stability of localized states in the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) equation with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities, describing the so-called quantum droplets and bubbles. Those states exist within an interval known as the pinning region, as we vary a control parameter. Within the interval, multistable states are connected through multiple hysteresis, called homoclinic snaking. In particular, we explore its mechanism and consider two limiting cases of coupling strength: weak (anti-continuum) and strong (continuum) limits. We employ an asymptotic and a variational method for the weak and strong coupling limits, respectively, to capture the pinning region's width. The width exhibits an algebraic and an exponentially small dependence on the coupling constant for the weak and strong coupling, respectively. This finding is supported by both analytical and numerical results, which show excellent agreement. We also consider the modulational instability of spatially uniform solutions. Our work sheds light on the intricate interplay between multistability and homoclinic snaking in discrete quantum systems, paving the way for further exploration of complex nonlinear phenomena in this context.</description>

      <title>Ghost states underlying spatial and temporal patterns: how non-existing invariant solutions control nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to a saddle-node bifurcation, when two invariant solutions collide and disappear, the behavior of a dynamical system can closely resemble that of a solution which is no longer present at the chosen parameter value. For bifurcating equilibria in low-dimensional ODEs, the influence of such 'ghosts' on the temporal behavior of the system, namely delayed transitions, has been studied previously. We consider spatio-temporal PDEs and characterize the phenomenon of ghosts by defining representative state-space structures, which we term 'ghost states,' as minima of appropriately chosen cost functions. Using recently developed variational methods, we can compute and parametrically continue ghost states of equilibria, periodic orbits, and other invariant solutions. We demonstrate the relevance of ghost states to the observed dynamics in various nonlinear systems including chaotic maps, the Lorenz ODE system, the spatio-temporally chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE, the buckling of an elastic arc, and 3D Rayleigh-B\'enard convection.</description>

      <title>Soliton Dynamics over a Disordered Topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the dynamics of a soliton propagating on the surface of a fluid in a 4-m-long canal with a random or periodic bottom topography. Using a full space-and-time resolved wavefield measurement, we evidence, for the first time experimentally, how the soliton is affected by the disorder, in the context of Anderson localization, and how localization depends on nonlinearity. For weak soliton amplitudes, the localization length is found in quantitative agreement with a linear shallow-water theory. For higher amplitudes, this spatial attenuation of the soliton amplitude is found to be enhanced. Behind the leading soliton slowed down by the topography, different experimentally unreported dynamics occur: Fission into backward and forward nondispersive pulses for the periodic case, and scattering into dispersive waves for the random case. Our findings open doors to potential applications regarding ocean coastal protection against large-amplitude waves.</description>

      <title>Pattern dynamics of the nonreciprocal Swift-Hohenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pattern dynamics of the one-dimensional nonreciprocal Swift-Hohenberg model. Characteristic spatiotemporal patterns such as disordered, aligned, swap, chiral-swap, and chiral phases emerge depending on the parameters. We classify the characteristic spatiotemporal patterns obtained in numerical simulation by focusing on the spatiotemporal Fourier spectrum of the order parameters. We derive a reduced dynamical system by using the spatial Fourier series expansion. We analyze the bifurcation structure around the fixed points corresponding to the aligned and chiral phases, and explain the transitions between them. The disordered phase is destabilized either to the aligned phase by the Turing bifurcation or to the chiral phase by the wave bifurcation, while the aligned phase and the chiral phase are connected by the pitchfork bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paraxial propagation of a quasi-monochromatic light wave with two circular polarizations in a defocusing Kerr medium with anomalous dispersion inside a waveguide of annular cross-section was considered. In the phase-separated mode, the dynamics is similar to a flow of immiscible fluids. For some initial conditions with relative gliding of the fluids along the interface, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in its ``quantum'' variant is developed. Numerical simulations of the corresponding coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations have shown formation of specific structures at the nonlinear stage of the instability. Similar structures have been known in the theory of binary Bose-Einstein condensates, but for optics they were presented for the first time.</description>
