      <title>Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</description>

      <title>Vestigial pairing from fluctuating magnetism and triplet superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature vestigial superconducting phases of a two-dimensional system of fluctuating spin-triplet pairing and spin magnetism. Denoting the respective primary order parameters by $\mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{N}$, which are not long-range ordered at finite temperature, the composite fields $\phi_{dd} = \mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{d}$ and $\phi_{dN} = \mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{N}$ are spin-rotation invariant and can condense at finite temperature. Using a large-$N$ approach that respects the Mermin-Wagner theorem, we here derive the phase diagram which features two vestigial superconductors: $(A)$ a charge-$4e$ superconductor with $\phi_{dd}\neq 0$ and $\phi_{dN} =0$ and $(B)$ a charge-$2e$ state with $\phi_{dN} ,\phi_{dd}\neq 0$. We analyze the temperature and coupling-constant dependent properties of these two superconductors using a perturbative approach and a variational Hartree-Fock study. This reveals non-trivial spectra in the superconductors, which result from the fundamental building blocks being distinct from the usual Cooper pairs--in phase $(A)$, the elementary bosons are bound states of four electrons and, in phase $(B)$, of three electrons and a hole. This work complements the previous study [Nat. Commun. 15, 1713 (2024), arXiv:2301.01344], which focused on the properties of phase $(B)$.</description>

      <title>Finite-size and quenching effects on hyperuniform structures formed during cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outstanding physical properties of hyperuniform condensed matter systems holds significant promise for technological applications and studying effects that may disrupt this hidden order is therefore very important. Vortex matter in superconductors is a model system to study this problem since imaging experiments have revealed that correlated disorder in the host media and finite size effects disrupt the hyperuniformity of the in-plane arrangement of vortices. Here we report simulations of layered interacting elastic lines as a model for the vortex lattice in three-dimensional superconductors, following a cooling protocol that closely mimics the experimental conditions. We show that finite-thickness effects limiting the hyperuniformity range arise both in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium. Our results provide a theoretical framework to draw a realistic road-map on synthesizing hyperuniform materials when cooling structures on finite host media with disorder.</description>

      <title>Highly-Linear Proximity-Based Bi-SQUID Operating above 4 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a highly linear superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) amplifier based on a double-loop (Bi-SQUID) architecture incorporating three superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (S-N-S) junctions. Fabricated using niobium-gold technology, the device exhibits robust operation at liquid helium temperatures, with a superconducting transition temperature of 8.5 K. The flux-to-voltage transfer function demonstrates sharp, symmetric, and highly linear behavior at temperatures up to 5 K. Bi-SQUIDs featuring our single-element S-N-S design represent an interesting and original approach to this field, as they demonstrate a numerically estimated spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) linearity exceeding 60 dB, achieved in a single element, simplifying the requirements in terms of arrays containing hundreds of junctions. These results highlight the potential of proximity-based Bi-SQUIDs for compact, low-noise, and highly linear cryogenic amplifiers in quantum sensing, magnetometry, and biomedical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Nonsymmorphic symmetry protected hourglass Dirac chain topology and conventional superconductivity in ZrIrGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary transition-metal germanide superconductors with nonsymmorphic symmetries offer promising platforms for symmetry-protected topological phases. In this work, we investigate ZrIrGe, which crystallizes in the nonsymmorphic TiNiSi-type structure. Electrical, magnetic, and specific heat measurements confirm bulk type-II superconductivity with a full gap and a transition temperature of 2.84(7) K, consistent with weak-coupling BCS behavior. First-principles calculations reveal hourglass-shaped bulk band dispersions and a Dirac chain composed of symmetry-protected fourfold-degenerate Dirac points, leading to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally, ZrIrGe exhibits a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological character, resulting in helical surface states that cross the Fermi level, making it a strong candidate for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of conventional superconductivity and topological band features establishes ZrIrGe as a rare stoichiometric system for exploring intrinsic topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Bimagnon dispersion of La2CuO4 probed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the study of the magnetic excitations of Mott insulator La2CuO4 by using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and cluster calculations within the framework of exact diagonalization. Our results demonstrate experimentally that the bimagnon excitation in Cu L-edge RIXS is enhanced if the incident x-ray energy is slightly above the absorption edge. Through incident-energy-dependent momentum-resolved RIXS, we investigated the excitation of the bimagnon with predominantly A1 symmetry. The bimagnons of La2CuO4 exhibit a nearly flat dispersion with momentum along the Cu-O bond direction. This observation agrees with the bimagnon dispersion from the calculations on a single-band Hubbard model rather than a Heisenberg model with only the nearest neighbor exchange interaction. This means that the effect of the higher-order spin couplings such as the cyclic or ring exchange interactions caused by the coherent motion of electrons beyond nearest-neighbor sites is important for understanding the bimagnon dynamics of cuprates.</description>

      <title>Cavity-altered superconductivity</title>

Abstract: Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and prominent mode confinement. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. Our work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground state properties of complex quantum materials.</description>

      <title>On-Demand and Tunable Andreev-Conversion of Single-Electron Charge Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron quantum optics explores coherent single-electron charge pulse propagation in electronic nanoscale circuits akin to table-top photon setups. While past experiments focused on normal-state conductors, incorporating superconductors holds promise for exploiting the electron-hole degree of freedom in quantum sensing applications and quantum information processing. Here, we propose and analyze an on-demand and tunable mechanism for converting single-electron pulses into holes through Andreev processes on a superconductor. We develop a Floquet-Nambu scattering formalism to demonstrate the dynamic conversion of charge pulses and the controllable generation of coherent electron-hole superpositions through interferometric magnetic flux control based on the chiral edge states of a quantum Hall sample. Our discussion covers optimal conditions in realistic scenarios, affirming the feasibility of our proposal with current technology.</description>

      <title>Twisting the Hubbard model into the Momentum-Mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08746v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubbard model is a standard theoretical tool for studying materials with strong electron-electron interactions, such as the cuprate superconductors. Unfortunately, interaction-driven phenomena such as the transition into the strongly correlated Mott insulator phase are difficult to treat with established theoretical techniques. However, the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model displays similar Mott physics. Here we show how the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model can be deformed continuously into the Hubbard model. The trick is to systematically re-introduce all the momentum mixing the original Hatsugai-Kohmoto model omits. This can be accomplished by grouping $n$-momenta into a cell and hybridizing them resulting in the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto (MMHK) model. We recover the Bethe ansatz ground state energy of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to within 1$\%$ from only ten mixed momenta. Overall the convergence scales as $1/n^2$ as opposed to the inverse linear behaviour of standard finite-cluster techniques. Our results for a square lattice reproduce all known features from state-of-the-art simulations also with only a few mixed momenta. Consequently, we believe the MMHK model offers an alternative tool for strongly correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Nambu theory of electron quantum optics with superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Floquet-Nambu theory to describe the time-dependent quantum transport in mesoscopic circuits involving superconductors. The central object of our framework is the first-order correlation function, which accounts for the excitations that are generated by a time-dependent voltage and their coherent scattering off the interface with a superconductor. We analyze the time-dependent current generated by periodic voltage pulses and how it depends on the excitation energies of the voltage drive compared to the gap of the superconductor. Our general formalism allows us to identify the conditions for the excitations that are scattered off the superconductor to become coherent electron-hole superpositions. To this end, we consider the purity of the outgoing states, which characterizes their ability to carry quantum information. To illustrate our formalism, we apply it to a system composed of chiral quantum Hall edge states connected to a superconductor, and we calculate the current in the outgoing lead and the purity of the outgoing states for Lorentzian and harmonic voltage drives. Our framework paves the way for systematic investigations of time-dependent scattering problems involving superconductivity, and it may help interpret future experiments in electron quantum optics with superconductors.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Niobium Coaxial Cavity with $\sim0.1\,$second Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm int} \gtrsim 3\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm int}\sim90\,\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.</description>
