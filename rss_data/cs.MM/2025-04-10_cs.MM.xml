      <title>Extending Visual Dynamics for Video-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music profoundly enhances video production by improving quality, engagement, and emotional resonance, sparking growing interest in video-to-music generation. Despite recent advances, existing approaches remain limited in specific scenarios or undervalue the visual dynamics. To address these limitations, we focus on tackling the complexity of dynamics and resolving temporal misalignment between video and music representations. To this end, we propose DyViM, a novel framework to enhance dynamics modeling for video-to-music generation. Specifically, we extract frame-wise dynamics features via a simplified motion encoder inherited from optical flow methods, followed by a self-attention module for aggregation within frames. These dynamic features are then incorporated to extend existing music tokens for temporal alignment. Additionally, high-level semantics are conveyed through a cross-attention mechanism, and an annealing tuning strategy benefits to fine-tune well-trained music decoders efficiently, therefore facilitating seamless adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate DyViM's superiority over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

      <title>Why We Feel: Breaking Boundaries in Emotional Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing emotion analysis emphasizes which emotion arises (e.g., happy, sad, angry) but neglects the deeper why. We propose Emotion Interpretation (EI), focusing on causal factors-whether explicit (e.g., observable objects, interpersonal interactions) or implicit (e.g., cultural context, off-screen events)-that drive emotional responses. Unlike traditional emotion recognition, EI tasks require reasoning about triggers instead of mere labeling. To facilitate EI research, we present EIBench, a large-scale benchmark encompassing 1,615 basic EI samples and 50 complex EI samples featuring multifaceted emotions. Each instance demands rationale-based explanations rather than straightforward categorization. We further propose a Coarse-to-Fine Self-Ask (CFSA) annotation pipeline, which guides Vision-Language Models (VLLMs) through iterative question-answer rounds to yield high-quality labels at scale. Extensive evaluations on open-source and proprietary large language models under four experimental settings reveal consistent performance gaps-especially for more intricate scenarios-underscoring EI's potential to enrich empathetic, context-aware AI applications. Our benchmark and methods are publicly available at: https://github.com/Lum1104/EIBench, offering a foundation for advanced multimodal causal analysis and next-generation affective computing.</description>

      <title>FMNV: A Dataset of Media-Published News Videos for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: News media, particularly video-based platforms, have become deeply embedded in daily life, concurrently amplifying risks of misinformation dissemination. Consequently, multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant research attention. However, existing datasets predominantly comprise user-generated videos characterized by crude editing and limited public engagement, whereas professionally crafted fake news videos disseminated by media outlets often politically or virally motivated pose substantially greater societal harm. To address this gap, we construct FMNV, a novel dataset exclusively composed of news videos published by media organizations. Through empirical analysis of existing datasets and our curated collection, we categorize fake news videos into four distinct types. Building upon this taxonomy, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate deceptive content by manipulating authentic media-published news videos. Furthermore, we propose FMNVD, a baseline model featuring a dual-stream architecture integrating CLIP and Faster R-CNN for video feature extraction, enhanced by co-attention mechanisms for feature refinement and multimodal aggregation. Comparative experiments demonstrate both the generalization capability of FMNV across multiple baselines and the superior detection efficacy of FMNVD. This work establishes critical benchmarks for detecting high-impact fake news in media ecosystems while advancing methodologies for cross-modal inconsistency analysis.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Verification for Zero-Shot Detection of Multimodal Disinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of disinformation on social media, especially through the strategic manipulation or repurposing of images, paired with provocative text, presents a complex challenge for traditional fact-checking methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel zero-shot approach to identify and interpret such multimodal disinformation, leveraging real-time evidence from credible sources. Our framework goes beyond simple true-or-false classifications by analyzing both the textual and visual components of social media claims in a structured, interpretable manner. By constructing a graph-based representation of entities and relationships within the claim, combined with pretrained visual features, our system automatically retrieves and matches external evidence to identify inconsistencies. Unlike traditional models dependent on labeled datasets, our method empowers users with transparency, illuminating exactly which aspects of the claim hold up to scrutiny and which do not. Our framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while offering enhanced explainability.</description>

      <title>A Multimedia Analytics Model for the Foundation Model Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advances in Foundation Models and agentic Artificial Intelligence are transforming multimedia analytics by enabling richer, more sophisticated interactions between humans and analytical systems. Existing conceptual models for visual and multimedia analytics, however, do not adequately capture the complexity introduced by these powerful AI paradigms. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive multimedia analytics model specifically designed for the foundation model era. Building upon established frameworks from visual analytics, multimedia analytics, knowledge generation, analytic task definition, mixed-initiative guidance, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, our model emphasizes integrated human-AI teaming based on visual analytics agents from both technical and conceptual perspectives. Central to the model is a seamless, yet explicitly separable, interaction channel between expert users and semi-autonomous analytical processes, ensuring continuous alignment between user intent and AI behavior. The model addresses practical challenges in sensitive domains such as intelligence analysis, investigative journalism, and other fields handling complex, high-stakes data. We illustrate through detailed case studies how our model facilitates deeper understanding and targeted improvement of multimedia analytics solutions. By explicitly capturing how expert users can optimally interact with and guide AI-powered multimedia analytics systems, our conceptual framework sets a clear direction for system design, comparison, and future research.</description>

      <title>Taming Data and Transformers for Scalable Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scalability of ambient sound generators is hindered by data scarcity, insufficient caption quality, and limited scalability in model architecture. This work addresses these challenges by advancing both data and model scaling. First, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset collection pipeline tailored for ambient audio generation, resulting in AutoReCap-XL, the largest ambient audio-text dataset with over 47 million clips. To provide high-quality textual annotations, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality automatic audio captioning model. By adopting a Q-Former module and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of $83.2$, a $3.2\%$ improvement over previous captioning models. Finally, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. We demonstrate its benefits from data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to baseline audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of $4.7\%$ in FAD score, $11.1\%$ in IS, and $13.5\%$ in CLAP score. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.</description>

      <title>EveGuard: Defeating Vibration-based Side-Channel Eavesdropping with Audio Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vibrometry-based side channels pose a significant privacy risk, exploiting sensors like mmWave radars, light sensors, and accelerometers to detect vibrations from sound sources or proximate objects, enabling speech eavesdropping. Despite various proposed defenses, these involve costly hardware solutions with inherent physical limitations. This paper presents EveGuard, a software-driven defense framework that creates adversarial audio, protecting voice privacy from side channels without compromising human perception. We leverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional microphones, where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record changes in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses. EveGuard first proposes a perturbation generator model (PGM) that effectively suppresses sensor-based eavesdropping while maintaining high audio quality. Second, to enable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task called Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We further apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for Eve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a protection rate of more than 97 percent from audio classifiers and significantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction. We further validate the performance of EveGuard across three adaptive attack mechanisms. We have conducted a user study to verify the perceptual quality of our perturbed audio.</description>
