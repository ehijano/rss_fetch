      <title>Shell Effects in Quasi-fission in Reactions Forming 226Th Compound Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-fission (QF) reactions occur in fully damped heavy-ion collisions without the formation of an equilibrated compound nucleus, leading to the formation of fragments with similar properties as in fission reactions. Similar shell effects are expected to affect fragment formation in both fission and QF. Our purpose is to investigate QF dynamics in different reactions forming the same compound nucleus and search for possible signatures of shell effects in fragment formation. 50Ca+176Yb and 96Zr+130Sn QF reactions are simulated with the time-dependent Hartree-Fock code Sky3D near the Coulomb barrier. Evolutions of the quadrupole (Q20) and octupole (Q30) moments are interpreted in terms of features of the potential energy surface (PES) of the 226Th compound nucleus. Both reactions encounter QF. In 50Ca+176Yb, those only occur at finite angular momenta. In the more symmetric 96Zr+130Sn reaction with stronger Coulomb repulsion in the entrance channel, QF also occurs in central collisions. In agreement with earlier predictions, 50Ca+176Yb encounters partial mass equilibration that is stopped when the heavy fragment reaches Z~54 protons, as in the asymmetric fission mode of 226Th. 96Zr+130Sn encounters an inverse QF also leading to similar fragments as in asymmetric fission. In both systems, QF trajectories in the Q20-Q30 plane follow the asymmetric fission valley of 226Th PES. The observation of an inverse QF is a clear prediction that shell effects have a strong influence in QF. The similarity between fragments formed in asymmetric fission and QF supports the idea that the same shell effects are at play in both mechanisms. Interpreting QF dynamics with PES used in fission is naturally limited by the fact that these PES are usually computed with axial symmetry, no angular momentum and no excitation energy, thus motivating future developments of PES for QF.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X \to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Impact of (magneto-)thermoelectric effect on diffusion of conserved charges in hot and dense hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric effect, which describes the generation of an electric field induced by temperature and conserved charge chemical potential gradients, in the hot and dense hadronic matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Utilizing the Boltzmann kinetic theory within the repulsive mean-field hadron resonance gas model, we evaluate both the diffusion thermopower matrix and diffusion coefficient matrix for the baryon number ($B$), electric charge ($Q$), and strangeness ($S$).The Landau-Lifshitz frame is enforced in the derivation. We find that the thermoelectric effect hinders the diffusion processes of multiple conserved charges, particularly reducing the coupling between electric charge and baryon number (strangeness) in baryon (strangeness) diffusion. Based on the fact that the repulsive mean-field interactions between hadrons have a significant effect on the diffusion thermopower matrix and diffusion coefficient matrix in the baryon-rich region, we extend the investigation to include the impact of the magnetic field, analyzing the magneto-thermoelectric effect on both the diffusion coefficient matrix and the Hall-like diffusion coefficient matrix. The sensitivity of the magnetic field-dependent diffusion thermopower matrix and magneto-thermoelectric modified diffusion coefficient matrix to the choices of various transverse conditions is also studied.</description>

      <title>Nuclear medium effects on the properties of $\Lambda(1405)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance with $I(J^{P})=0(1/2^{-}) $ in the context of the pentaquark hypothesis in the nuclear medium. For the investigation of the influence of the nuclear medium on the physical parameters of $\Lambda(1405)$, we propose a molecular-type structure involving $K^{-}p$ and $\bar{K}^{0}n$ admixtures, correlated with the nuclear matter density. Our analysis reveals a substantial shift in both mass and residue, approximately $20\%$ and $38\%$, respectively. These findings have significant implications for experimental researchers aimed at identifying in-medium characteristics of hyperon resonances.</description>

      <title>Relativistic energy density functional from momentum space to coordinate space within a coherent density fluctuation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this theoretical study, we have derived a simplified analytical expression for the binding energy per nucleon as a function of density and isospin asymmetry within the relativistic mean-field model. We have generated a new parameterization for the density-dependent DD-ME2 parameter set using the Relativistic-Hartree-Bogoliubov approach. Moreover, this work attempts to revisit the prior polynomial fitting in [Phy. Rev. C 103, 024305 (2021)] for the non-linear NL3 force parameter to provide a simplified set of equations for the energy density functional which is used for calculating the surface properties of finite nuclei. The current study improves the existing fitting procedure by effectively proposing a simpler model that provides comparably precise results while lowering the computational expense. To study the surface properties of finite nuclei with these parameterizations, we have adopted the coherent density fluctuation model, which effectively translates the quantities of nuclear matter from momentum space to coordinate space at local density. The isospin properties, such as symmetry energy and its surface and volume components, slope parameter, finite nuclear incompressibility, and surface incompressibility for even-even nuclei, are calculated for different mass regions. Moreover, we have studied the effect of density, weight function, and choice of relativistic force parameters on the surface properties. The consequence of this work will help to determine the properties of nuclei along the nuclear landscape and can facilitate an improved understanding of the island of stability, heavy-ion collision, and nucleosynthesis, among others.</description>

      <title>Implementation of the microscopic nuclear potential in the coupled channels calculations to study the fusion dynamics of Oxygen based reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we have incorporated the microscopic relativistic nuclear potential obtained from recently developed relativistic R3Y NN potential in the coupled channels code CCFULL to study the fusion dynamics. The R3Y NN-potential and the densities of interacting nuclei are obtained for the relativistic mean-field approach for the NL3$^*$ parameter set. It is to be noted that the R3Y NN potential can be expressed in terms of masses of the mesons and their couplings by considering the meson degrees of freedom within the relativistic mean field, which has a form similar to the widely used M3Y potential. We focused on the fusion cross-sections for $Oxygen$-based reactions with targets from different mass regions of the periodic table i.e. $^{16}$O + $^{24}$Mg, $^{18}$O + $^{24}$Mg, $^{16}$O + $^{148}$Sm, $^{16}$O + $^{176}$Hf, $^{16}$O + $^{176}$Yb, $^{16}$O + $^{182}$W, and $^{16}$O + $^{186}$W. A comparison is also made with the ones calculated using the nuclear potential obtained from the traditional Woods-Saxon potential and the widely used M3Y NN potential within CCFULL. The coupled channel calculations are performed with shape and rotational degrees of freedom to examine the fusion enhancement at below-barrier energies. It is observed from the calculations that the fusion cross-sections obtained using R3Y NN potential with rotational degrees of freedom are found to be more consistent with the experimental data than those for the M3Y and Woods-Saxon potentials mainly at below barrier energies.</description>

      <title>Relativistic mean-field study of alpha decay in superheavy isotopes with 100 \texorpdfstring{$\leq$ Z $\leq$}-120</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-decay half-lives of superheavy nuclei with $100 \leq Z \leq 120$ are comprehensively analyzed using the axially deformed relativistic mean field (RMF) formalism for the NL3$^*$ parameter set. We employ RMF binding energies to determine the $\alpha$-decay energies and make a comparison with both the available experimental data and the theoretical results obtained from the global nuclear mass model WS4. The four distinct formulae, specifically the modified scaling law Brown, modified Viola-Seaborg, Yibin {\it et al.} formula, and its modified form are used to calculate the decay half-lives and examine the numerical correlation between the half-life ($T_{1/2}$) for each $\alpha$-decay energy. We notice that $T_{1/2}$ is significantly dependent on the decay formula in terms of isospin asymmetry and decay energy. We also noticed that modified scaling law Brown formula estimates of half-lives agreed comparatively better with the experiment as compared to others. Moreover, the present investigation provides significant information on the stability of the superheavy island considered for ongoing and/or future experiments.</description>

      <title>Kinetic temperature and radial flow velocity estimation using identified hadrons and light (anti-)nuclei produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the investigation of the kinetic freeze-out properties of identified hadrons ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\bar p)$) along with light (anti-)nuclei $d (\bar d)$, $t (\bar t)$ and ${}^{3}He$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. A simultaneous fit is performed with the Blast-Wave (BW) model to the transverse momentum ({\ppt}) spectra of identified hadrons together with light (anti-)nuclei produced in {\auau} collisions at {\sqrtsNN} = 7.7 -- 200 GeV and in {\pbpb} collisions at {\sqrtsNN} = 2.76. The energy and centrality dependence of kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_{kin}$) and collective flow velocity $\langle \beta \rangle$ has been studied. It is observed that light (anti-)nuclei also participate in the collective expansion of the medium created in the collision when included in a common fit with the light hadrons. We observe a marginal rise in the $T_{kin}$ and a slight decrease in $\langle \beta \rangle$ when compared to the values obtained from the fit to light hadrons, indicating that heavier particles decouple earlier in time from the fireball compared to the light hadrons due to higher masses and are more sensitive to the effects of the radial flow. A similar $\langle \beta \rangle$ and significant larger $T_{kin}$ is observed when fit is performed to only protons and light (anti-)nuclei. Additionally, we also observe that the $T_{kin}$ increases from central to peripheral collisions, which is consistent with the argument of short-lived fireball in peripheral collisions. Whereas the $\langle \beta \rangle$ shows a decreasing trend from central to peripheral collisions indicating a more rapid expansion in the central collisions. Both, $T_{kin}$ and $\langle \beta \rangle$ show a weak dependence on the collision energy at most energies. We also observe a strong anti-correlation between $T_{kin}$ and $\langle \beta \rangle$.</description>

      <title>What Can We Learn from Directed Flow at STAR-FTX Energies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of simulations of directed flow of various hadrons in Au+Au collisions at collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 and 4.5 GeV. Simulations are performed within the model three-fluid dynamics (3FD) and the event simulator based on it (THESEUS). The results are compared with recent STAR data. The directed flows of various particles provide information on dynamics in various parts and at various stages of the colliding system depending on the particle. However, the information on the equation of state is not always directly accessible because of strong influence of the afterburner stage or insufficient equilibration of the matter. It is found that the crossover scenario gives the best overall description of the data. This crossover EoS is soft in the hadronic phase. The transition into QGP in Au+Au collisions occurs at collision energies between 3 and 4.5 GeV, at baryon densities $n_B \geq 4 n_0$ and temperatures $\approx 150$ MeV. In-medium effects in the directed flow of (anti)kaons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Translationally invariant shell model calculation of the quasielastic $(p,2p)$ process at intermediate relativistic energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic beams of heavy ions interacting with various nuclear targets allow to study a broad range of problems starting from nuclear equation of state to the traditional nuclear structure. Some questions which were impossible to answer heretofore -- can be addressed nowadays by using inverse kinematics. These includes the structure of short-lived nuclei and the precision study of exclusive channels with production of residual nuclei in certain quantum states. Theoretical understanding such processes is so far based on factorization models which combine the single-step amplitude of the reaction on a bound nucleon or nuclear cluster with a certain wave function of its relative motion with respect to the residual nucleus. The nuclear structure information is encoded in the spectroscopic amplitude, calculable within nuclear many-body theories. In this work, we use for this purpose the translationally-invariant shell model with configuration mixing and demonstrate that it successfully reproduces the single-differential and integrated cross sections of the quasielastic proton knockout, $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2p)^{11}\mbox{B}$, with outgoing $^{11}$B in the ground state and low-lying excited states measured at GSI at 400 MeV/nucleon.</description>

Abstract: In this work we represent the $1/2$ Spin particles with complex quaternions using a transformation to 2x2 matrices in order to obtain the Pauli matrices. With this representation we determine the states, rotation operators and the total angular momentum function in the complex quaternion space. Using this representation we work the solution for the relativistic hydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in Rastall gravity: Hydrostatic equilibrium and radial pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of Rastall gravity, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical stability against radial pulsations of compact stars, where a free parameter $\beta$ measures the deviations from General Relativity (GR). We derive both the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and the Sturm-Liouville differential equation governing the adiabatic radial oscillations. Such equations are solved numerically in order to obtain the compact-star properties for two realistic equations of state (EoSs). For hadronic matter, the fundamental mode frequency $\omega_0$ becomes unstable almost at the critical central energy density corresponding to the maximum gravitational mass. However, for quark matter, where larger values of $\vert\beta\vert$ are required to observe appreciable changes in the mass-radius diagram, there exist stable stars after the maximum-mass configuration for negative values of $\beta$. Using an independent analysis, our results reveal that the emergence of a cusp can be used as a criterion to indicate the onset of instability when the binding energy is plotted as a function of the proper mass. Specifically, we find that the central-density value where the binding energy is a minimum corresponds precisely to $\omega_0^2 =0$.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects on sound velocity peak and conformality in isospin QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermal effects on equations of state (EOS) in isospin QCD, utilizing a quark-meson model coupled to a Polyakov loop. The quark-meson model is analyzed at one-loop that is the minimal order to include quark substructure constraints on pions which condense at finite isospin density. In the previous study we showed that the quark-meson model at zero temperature produces the sound velocity peak and the negative trace anomaly in the domain between the chiral effective theory regime at low density and the perturbative QCD regime at high density, in reasonable agreement with lattice simulations. We now include thermal effects from quarks in the Polyakov loop background and examine EOS, especially the sound velocity and trace anomaly along isentropic trajectories. At large isospin density, there are three temperature windows; (i) the pion condensed region with almost vanishing Polyakov loops, (ii) the pion condensed region with finite Polyakov loops, and (iii) the quark gas without pion condensates. In the domain (i), the gap associated with the pion condensate strongly quenches thermal excitations. As the system approaches the domain (ii), thermal quarks, which behave as non-relativistic particles, add energy density but little pressure, substantially reducing the sound velocity to the value less than the conformal value while increasing the trace anomaly toward the positive value. Approaching the domain (iii), thermal quarks become more relativistic as pion condensates melt, increasing sound velocity toward the conformal limit. Corrections from thermal pions are also briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: The inverse power method is a numerical algorithm to obtain the eigenvectors of a matrix. In this work, we develop an iteration algorithm, based on the inverse power method, to numerically solve the Schr\"odinger equation that couples an arbitrary number of components. Such an algorithm can also be applied to the multi-body systems. To show the power and accuracy of this method, we also present an example of solving the Dirac equation under the presence of an external scalar potential and a constant magnetic field, with source code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Microscopic parametrization of the near threshold oscillations of the nucleon time-like effective electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the recent near threshold BESIII data for the nucleon time-like effective form factors. The damped oscillation emerging from the subtraction of the dipole formula is treated in non-perturbative-QCD, making use of the light cone distribution amplitudes expansion. Non-perturbative effects are accounted for by considering Q2-dependent coefficients in such expansions, whose free parameters are determined by fitting to the proton and neutron data. Possible implications and future analysis have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Causal hydrodynamic fluctuations in a one-dimensional expanding system</title>

Abstract: We derive equations of motion of hydrodynamic fluctuations performing perturbative expansion of the energy-momentum conservation equations around the boost invariant solution in one-dimensional expanding system. In the course of derivation, we do not assume any specific forms of constitutive equations for shear stress tensor $\pi^{\mu \nu}$ and bulk pressure $\Pi$. Therefore, the framework enables us to employ any constitutive equations beyond the Navier-Stokes theory which satisfy the causality. Employing Israel-Stewart equations as examples of the constitutive equations, we demonstrate the dynamics of causal hydrodynamic fluctuations in (1+1)-dimensional Milne coordinates. We observe that structure of energy density fluctuations is almost frozen in the early stage of the expansion. Two-point correlations of energy density fluctuations turn out to be closely related with the properties of the medium such as sound velocity, viscosity, and relaxation time. Furthermore, we show that two-particle correlation functions of final hadrons after freezeout inherit correlations of thermodynamic variables and flow rapidity. This opens a new door for an analysis of transport properties of the medium produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Time Scales in Many-Body Fast Neutrino Flavor Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time scales associated with many-body fast neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernova are explored in the context of an effective two-flavor model with axial symmetry. We present a preliminary study of time scales obtained from a linear stability analysis and from the distributions of Loschmidt echo crossing times (intimately connected to dynamical phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems) determined by time evolution with the exact many-body Hamiltonian. Starting from a tensor-product initial state describing systems of $N$ neutrinos, with $N/2$ electron-type and $N/2$ heavy-type, with uniform angular distributions, the Loschmidt echo crossing times, $t_{\mathcal{L}_{\times}}$, are found to exhibit two distinct time scales that are exponentially separated. The second peak structure at longer times, effectively absent for $N=4$, develops with increasing $N$. When re-scaled in terms of $\log t_{\mathcal{L}_{\times}}$, the distributions are found to become increasingly well described by the sum of two stable distributions. The distribution of Loschmidt echo crossing times differs somewhat from the results of the (numerical) linear stability analysis, which exhibits a peak at finite frequency and a second peak consistent with zero frequency. The exact analysis suggests that the zero-frequency instability manifests itself as a modest flavor-conversion time scale.</description>

      <title>Light Hypernuclei Production in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 GeV within Thermodynamic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations of the $\Lambda$-hyperon and light-hypernuclei production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 GeV were performed within updated Three-fluid Hydrodynamics-based Event Simulator Extended by UrQMD (Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics) final State interactions (THESEUS). The light (hyper)nuclei are treated thermodynamically, i.e. they are considered on the equal basis with hadrons. The only additional parameter is related to the late freeze-out that imitates the afterburner stage for the light (hyper)nuclei because the UrQMD is not able to dynamically treat them. The calculation of hypernuclei production is completely similar to that of light nuclei. The hypernuclei results are compared with recent STAR data. It is found that the calculated midrapidity $_\Lambda^3$H/$\Lambda$ ratio falls within the error bars of the experimental point. It is remarkable that large difference between the $t/p$ and $_\Lambda^3$H/$\Lambda$ ratios is reproduced without any additional parameters. Rapidity distributions of $_\Lambda^3$H/$\Lambda$ and $_\Lambda^4$He/$\Lambda$ ratios are predicted. Midrapidity mean transverse momenta of protons, $\Lambda$s and light (hyper)nuclei in central collisions well agree with the data. The calculated directed flow also reasonably well reproduces of the data.</description>

      <title>Quantum-number projected generator coordinate method for $^{21}$Ne with a chiral two-nucleon-plus-three-nucleon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a study of the low-lying states of deformed $^{21}$Ne within the framework of quantum-number projected generator coordinate method (PGCM), starting from a chiral two-nucleon-plus-three-nucleon (NN+3N) interaction. The wave functions of states are constructed as a linear combination of a set of axially-deformed Hartree-Fock-Bogliubov (HFB) wave functions with different quadrupole deformations. These HFB wave functions are projected onto different angular momenta and the correct neutron and proton numbers for $^{21}$Ne. The results of calculations based on the effective Hamiltonians derived by normal-ordering the 3N interaction with respect to three different reference states, including the quantum-number projected HFB wave functions for $^{20}$Ne, $^{22}$Ne, and an ensemble of them with equal weights, are compared. This study serves as a key step towards ab initio calculations of odd-mass deformed nuclei with the in-medium GCM.</description>

      <title>Linear response theory for spin alignment of vector mesons in thermal media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the spin alignment for unflavored vector mesons in thermalized quark-gluon plasma based on the Kubo formula in linear response theory. This is achieved by expanding the system to the first order of the coupling constant and the spatial gradient. The effect strongly relies on the vector meson's spectral functions which are determined by the interaction and medium properties. The spectral functions are calculated for the one-quark-loop self-energy with meson-quark interaction. The numerical results show that the correction to the spin alignment from the thermal shear tensor is of the order $10^{-4}\sim10^{-5}$ for the chosen values of quark-meson coupling constant, if the magnitude of thermal shear tensor is $10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Hadron Production in Ultra-relativistic Nuclear Collisions and Finite Baryon-Size Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate relative hadron production of various like and unlike mass particles in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions by employing a statistical thermal model with finite-sized baryons (antibaryons) to imitate the hard-core repulsive interactions leading to the excluded volume type effect. A strong evidence of strangeness suppression relative to the non-strange ones, mainly pions, particularly at higher energies is also observed. This study also indicates that at chemical freeze-out the particle ratios and strangeness suppression in the system obtained theoretically are sensitive to baryonic (antibaryonic) hard-core radius ($r_B$). A comparison with earlier analysis involving the strangeness suppression effect is made where baryons and antibaryons were treated as point-like particles. The available experimental data showing energy dependence of various particle ratios are well described throughout the range of the centre-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). The value of hard-core radius between 0.76 to 0.79 fm is found to fit the data quite well using $\chi^{2}$ minimization technique. Two different chemical freeze-out stages are found where the earlier one belongs to baryonic (hyperonic), antibaryonic (antihyperonic) states and the later one to mesonic degrees of freedom.</description>
