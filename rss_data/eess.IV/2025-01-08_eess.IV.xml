      <title>K-space Diffusion Model Based MR Reconstruction Method for Simultaneous Multislice Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous Multi-Slice(SMS) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique which excites several slices concurrently using multiband radiofrequency pulses to reduce scanning time. However, due to its variable data structure and difficulty in acquisition, it is challenging to integrate SMS data as training data into deep learning frameworks.This study proposed a novel k-space diffusion model of SMS reconstruction that does not utilize SMS data for training. Instead, it incorporates Slice GRAPPA during the sampling process to reconstruct SMS data from different acquisition modes.Our results demonstrated that this method outperforms traditional SMS reconstruction methods and can achieve higher acceleration factors without in-plane aliasing.</description>

      <title>A Self-supervised Diffusion Bridge for MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion bridges (DBs) are a class of diffusion models that enable faster sampling by interpolating between two paired image distributions. Training traditional DBs for image reconstruction requires high-quality reference images, which limits their applicability to settings where such references are unavailable. We propose SelfDB as a novel self-supervised method for training DBs directly on available noisy measurements without any high-quality reference images. SelfDB formulates the diffusion process by further sub-sampling the available measurements two additional times and training a neural network to reverse the corresponding degradation process by using the available measurements as the training targets. We validate SelfDB on compressed sensing MRI, showing its superior performance compared to the denoising diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Activating Associative Disease-Aware Vision Token Memory for LLM-Based X-ray Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray image based medical report generation achieves significant progress in recent years with the help of the large language model, however, these models have not fully exploited the effective information in visual image regions, resulting in reports that are linguistically sound but insufficient in describing key diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel associative memory-enhanced X-ray report generation model that effectively mimics the process of professional doctors writing medical reports. It considers both the mining of global and local visual information and associates historical report information to better complete the writing of the current report. Specifically, given an X-ray image, we first utilize a classification model along with its activation maps to accomplish the mining of visual regions highly associated with diseases and the learning of disease query tokens. Then, we employ a visual Hopfield network to establish memory associations for disease-related tokens, and a report Hopfield network to retrieve report memory information. This process facilitates the generation of high-quality reports based on a large language model and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including the IU X-ray, MIMIC-CXR, and Chexpert Plus.

      <title>DGSSA: Domain generalization with structural and stylistic augmentation for retinal vessel segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retinal vascular morphology is crucial for diagnosing diseases such as diabetes, glaucoma, and hypertension, making accurate segmentation of retinal vessels essential for early intervention. Traditional segmentation methods assume that training and testing data share similar distributions, which can lead to poor performance on unseen domains due to domain shifts caused by variations in imaging devices and patient demographics. This paper presents a novel approach, DGSSA, for retinal vessel image segmentation that enhances model generalization by combining structural and style augmentation strategies. We utilize a space colonization algorithm to generate diverse vascular-like structures that closely mimic actual retinal vessels, which are then used to generate pseudo-retinal images with an improved Pix2Pix model, allowing the segmentation model to learn a broader range of structure distributions. Additionally, we utilize PixMix to implement random photometric augmentations and introduce uncertainty perturbations, thereby enriching stylistic diversity and significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying imaging conditions. Our framework has been rigorously evaluated on four challenging datasets-DRIVE, CHASEDB, HRF, and STARE-demonstrating state-of-the-art performance that surpasses existing methods. This validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting its potential for clinical application in automated retinal vessel analysis.</description>

      <title>Salient Region Matching for Fully Automated MR-TRUS Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men. The registration of magnetic resonance (MR) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) can provide guidance for the targeted biopsy of prostate cancer. In this study, we propose a salient region matching framework for fully automated MR-TRUS registration. The framework consists of prostate segmentation, rigid alignment and deformable registration. Prostate segmentation is performed using two segmentation networks on MR and TRUS respectively, and the predicted salient regions are used for the rigid alignment. The rigidly-aligned MR and TRUS images serve as initialization for the deformable registration. The deformable registration network has a dual-stream encoder with cross-modal spatial attention modules to facilitate multi-modality feature learning, and a salient region matching loss to consider both structure and intensity similarity within the prostate region. Experiments on a public MR-TRUS dataset demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory registration results, outperforming several cutting-edge methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/mock1ngbrd/salient-region-matching.</description>

      <title>A generative approach for lensless imaging in low-light conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lensless imaging offers a lightweight, compact alternative to traditional lens-based systems, ideal for exploration in space-constrained environments. However, the absence of a focusing lens and limited lighting in such environments often result in low-light conditions, where the measurements suffer from complex noise interference due to insufficient capture of photons. This study presents a robust reconstruction method for high-quality imaging in low-light scenarios, employing two complementary perspectives: model-driven and data-driven. First, we apply a physic-model-driven perspective to reconstruct in the range space of the pseudo-inverse of the measurement model as a first guidance to extract information in the noisy measurements. Then, we integrate a generative-model based perspective to suppress residual noises as the second guidance to suppress noises in the initial noisy results. Specifically, a learnable Wiener filter-based module generates an initial noisy reconstruction. Then, for fast and, more importantly, stable generation of the clear image from the noisy version, we implement a modified conditional generative diffusion module. This module converts the raw image into the latent wavelet domain for efficiency and uses modified bidirectional training processes for stabilization. Simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in overall visual quality, advancing lensless imaging in challenging low-light environments.</description>

      <title>FgC2F-UDiff: Frequency-guided and Coarse-to-fine Unified Diffusion Model for Multi-modality Missing MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, missing modalities are commonly observed due to limitations in scan time, scan corruption, artifacts, motion, and contrast agent intolerance. Synthesis of missing MRI has been a means to address the limitations of modality insufficiency in clinical practice and research. However, there are still some challenges, such as poor generalization, inaccurate non-linear mapping, and slow processing speeds. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel unified synthesis model, the Frequency-guided and Coarse-to-fine Unified Diffusion Model (FgC2F-UDiff), designed for multiple inputs and outputs. Specifically, the Coarse-to-fine Unified Network (CUN) fully exploits the iterative denoising properties of diffusion models, from global to detail, by dividing the denoising process into two stages, coarse and fine, to enhance the fidelity of synthesized images. Secondly, the Frequency-guided Collaborative Strategy (FCS) harnesses appropriate frequency information as prior knowledge to guide the learning of a unified, highly non-linear mapping. Thirdly, the Specific-acceleration Hybrid Mechanism (SHM) integrates specific mechanisms to accelerate the diffusion model and enhance the feasibility of many-to-many synthesis. Extensive experimental evaluations have demonstrated that our proposed FgC2F-UDiff model achieves superior performance on two datasets, validated through a comprehensive assessment that includes both qualitative observations and quantitative metrics, such as PSNR SSIM, LPIPS, and FID.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Tuberculosis Diagnosis: Attention Residual U-Net and Vision Transformer Based Detection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, continues to be a major global health threat despite being preventable and curable. This burden is particularly high in low and middle income countries. Microscopy remains essential for diagnosing TB by enabling direct visualization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum smear samples, offering a cost effective approach for early detection and effective treatment. Given the labour-intensive nature of microscopy, automating the detection of bacilli in microscopic images is crucial to improve both the expediency and reliability of TB diagnosis. The current methodologies for detecting tuberculosis bacilli in bright field microscopic sputum smear images are hindered by limited automation capabilities, inconsistent segmentation quality, and constrained classification precision. This paper proposes a twostage deep learning methodology for tuberculosis bacilli detection, comprising bacilli segmentation followed by classification. In the initial phase, an advanced U-Net model employing attention blocks and residual connections is proposed to segment microscopic sputum smear images, enabling the extraction of Regions of Interest (ROIs). The extracted ROIs are then classified using a Vision Transformer, which we specifically customized as TBViT to enhance the precise detection of bacilli within the images. For the experiments, a newly developed dataset of microscopic sputum smear images derived from Ziehl-Neelsen-stained slides is used in conjunction with existing public datasets. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the experiments using various metrics demonstrates that the proposed model achieves significantly improved segmentation performance, higher classification accuracy, and a greater level of automation, surpassing existing methods.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Tuberculosis Bacilli Detection using Attention-Residual U-Net and Ensemble Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a critical global health issue, necessitating timely diagnosis and treatment. Current methods for detecting tuberculosis bacilli from bright field microscopic sputum smear images suffer from low automation, inadequate segmentation performance, and limited classification accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient hybrid approach that combines deep learning for segmentation and an ensemble model for classification. An enhanced U-Net model incorporating attention blocks and residual connections is introduced to precisely segment microscopic sputum smear images, facilitating the extraction of Regions of Interest (ROIs). These ROIs are subsequently classified using an ensemble classifier comprising Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), resulting in an accurate identification of bacilli within the images. Experiments conducted on a newly created dataset, along with public datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior segmentation performance, higher classification accuracy, and enhanced automation compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Value Mapping Virtual Staining Framework for Large-scale Histological Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of virtual staining technology provides a rapid and efficient alternative for researchers in tissue pathology. It enables the utilization of unlabeled microscopic samples to generate virtual replicas of chemically stained histological slices, or facilitate the transformation of one staining type into another. The remarkable performance of generative networks, such as CycleGAN, offers an unsupervised learning approach for virtual coloring, overcoming the limitations of high-quality paired data required in supervised learning. Nevertheless, large-scale color transformation necessitates processing large field-of-view images in patches, often resulting in significant boundary inconsistency and artifacts. Additionally, the transformation between different colorized modalities typically needs further efforts to modify loss functions and tune hyperparameters for independent training of networks. In this study, we introduce a general virtual staining framework that is adaptable to various conditions. We propose a loss function based on the value mapping constraint to ensure the accuracy of virtual coloring between different pathological modalities, termed the Value Mapping Generative Adversarial Network (VM-GAN). Meanwhile, we present a confidence-based tiling method to address the challenge of boundary inconsistency arising from patch-wise processing. Experimental results on diverse data with varying staining protocols demonstrate that our method achieves superior quantitative indicators and improved visual perception.</description>

      <title>Re-Visible Dual-Domain Self-Supervised Deep Unfolding Network for MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical practice, but suffered from prolonged acquisition time. Although deep learning methods have been proposed to accelerate acquisition and demonstrate promising performance, they rely on high-quality fully-sampled datasets for training in a supervised manner. However, such datasets are time-consuming and expensive-to-collect, which constrains their broader applications. On the other hand, self-supervised methods offer an alternative by enabling learning from under-sampled data alone, but most existing methods rely on further partitioned under-sampled k-space data as model's input for training, resulting in a loss of valuable information. Additionally, their models have not fully incorporated image priors, leading to degraded reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel re-visible dual-domain self-supervised deep unfolding network to address these issues when only under-sampled datasets are available. Specifically, by incorporating re-visible dual-domain loss, all under-sampled k-space data are utilized during training to mitigate information loss caused by further partitioning. This design enables the model to implicitly adapt to all under-sampled k-space data as input. Additionally, we design a deep unfolding network based on Chambolle and Pock Proximal Point Algorithm (DUN-CP-PPA) to achieve end-to-end reconstruction, incorporating imaging physics and image priors to guide the reconstruction process. By employing a Spatial-Frequency Feature Extraction (SFFE) block to capture global and local feature representation, we enhance the model's efficiency to learn comprehensive image priors. Experiments conducted on the fastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>Convergent Primal-Dual Plug-and-Play Image Restoration: A General Algorithm and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical experiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Deep Sylvester Posterior Inference for Adaptive Compressed Sensing in Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound images are commonly formed by sequential acquisition of beam-steered scan-lines. Minimizing the number of required scan-lines can significantly enhance frame rate, field of view, energy efficiency, and data transfer speeds. Existing approaches typically use static subsampling schemes in combination with sparsity-based or, more recently, deep-learning-based recovery. In this work, we introduce an adaptive subsampling method that maximizes intrinsic information gain in-situ, employing a Sylvester Normalizing Flow encoder to infer an approximate Bayesian posterior under partial observation in real-time. Using the Bayesian posterior and a deep generative model for future observations, we determine the subsampling scheme that maximizes the mutual information between the subsampled observations, and the next frame of the video. We evaluate our approach using the EchoNet cardiac ultrasound video dataset and demonstrate that our active sampling method outperforms competitive baselines, including uniform and variable-density random sampling, as well as equidistantly spaced scan-lines, improving mean absolute reconstruction error by 15%. Moreover, posterior inference and the sampling scheme generation are performed in just 0.015 seconds (66Hz), making it fast enough for real-time 2D ultrasound imaging applications.</description>

      <title>SCC-YOLO: An Improved Object Detector for Assisting in Brain Tumor Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumors can result in neurological dysfunction, alterations in cognitive and psychological states, increased intracranial pressure, and the occurrence of seizures, thereby presenting a substantial risk to human life and health. The You Only Look Once(YOLO) series models have demonstrated superior accuracy in object detection for medical imaging. In this paper, we develop a novel SCC-YOLO architecture by integrating the SCConv attention mechanism into YOLOv9. The SCConv module reconstructs an efficient convolutional module by reducing spatial and channel redundancy among features, thereby enhancing the learning of image features. We investigate the impact of intergrating different attention mechanisms with the YOLOv9 model on brain tumor image detection using both the Br35H dataset and our self-made dataset(Brain_Tumor_Dataset). Experimental results show that on the Br35H dataset, SCC-YOLO achieved a 0.3% improvement in mAp50 compared to YOLOv9, while on our self-made dataset, SCC-YOLO exhibited a 0.5% improvement over YOLOv9. SCC-YOLO has reached state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor detection. Source code is available at : https://jihulab.com/healthcare-information-studio/SCC-YOLO/-/tree/master</description>

      <title>MedFocusCLIP : Improving few shot classification in medical datasets using pixel wise attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the popularity of foundational models, parameter efficient fine tuning has become the defacto approach to leverage pretrained models to perform downstream tasks. Taking inspiration from recent advances in large language models, Visual Prompt Tuning, and similar techniques, learn an additional prompt to efficiently finetune a pretrained vision foundational model. However, we observe that such prompting is insufficient for fine-grained visual classification tasks such as medical image classification, where there is large inter-class variance, and small intra-class variance. Hence, in this paper we propose to leverage advanced segmentation capabilities of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) as a visual prompting cue to help visual encoder in the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) by guiding the attention in CLIP visual encoder to relevant regions in the image. This helps the model to focus on highly discriminative regions, without getting distracted from visually similar background features, an essential requirement in a fewshot, finegrained classification setting. We evaluate our method on diverse medical datasets including X-rays, CT scans, and MRI images, and report an accuracy of (71%, 81%, 86%, 58%) from the proposed approach on (COVID, lung-disease, brain-tumor, breast-cancer) datasets against (66%, 70%, 68%, 29%) from a pretrained CLIP model after fewshot training. The proposed approach also allows to obtain interpretable explanation for the classification performance through the localization obtained using segmentation.</description>

      <title>Semise: Semi-supervised learning for severity representation in medical image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces SEMISE, a novel method for representation learning in medical imaging that combines self-supervised and supervised learning. By leveraging both labeled and augmented data, SEMISE addresses the challenge of data scarcity and enhances the encoder's ability to extract meaningful features. This integrated approach leads to more informative representations, improving performance on downstream tasks. As result, our approach achieved a 12% improvement in classification and a 3% improvement in segmentation, outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of SIMESE to advance medical image analysis and offer more accurate solutions for healthcare applications, particularly in contexts where labeled data is limited.</description>

      <title>SELMA3D challenge: Self-supervised learning for 3D light-sheet microscopy image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent innovations in light sheet microscopy, paired with developments in tissue clearing techniques, enable the 3D imaging of large mammalian tissues with cellular resolution. Combined with the progress in large-scale data analysis, driven by deep learning, these innovations empower researchers to rapidly investigate the morphological and functional properties of diverse biological samples. Segmentation, a crucial preliminary step in the analysis process, can be automated using domain-specific deep learning models with expert-level performance. However, these models exhibit high sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a significant drop in accuracy when applied to data outside their training distribution. To address this limitation, and inspired by the recent success of self-supervised learning in training generalizable models, we organized the SELMA3D Challenge during the MICCAI 2024 conference. SELMA3D provides a vast collection of light-sheet images from cleared mice and human brains, comprising 35 large 3D images-each with over 1000^3 voxels-and 315 annotated small patches for finetuning, preliminary testing and final testing. The dataset encompasses diverse biological structures, including vessel-like and spot-like structures. Five teams participated in all phases of the challenge, and their proposed methods are reviewed in this paper. Quantitative and qualitative results from most participating teams demonstrate that self-supervised learning on large datasets improves segmentation model performance and generalization. We will continue to support and extend SELMA3D as an inaugural MICCAI challenge focused on self-supervised learning for 3D microscopy image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Feature-Empowered Deep Classification for Fast Mangrove Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mangrove mapping (MM) algorithm is an essential classification tool for environmental monitoring. The recent literature shows that compared with other index-based MM methods that treat pixels as spatially independent, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are crucial for leveraging spatial continuity information, leading to improved classification performance. In this work, we go a step further to show that quantum features provide radically new information for CNN to further upgrade the classification results. Simply speaking, CNN computes affine-mapping features, while quantum neural network (QNN) offers unitary-computing features, thereby offering a fresh perspective in the final decision-making (classification). To address the challenging MM problem, we design an entangled spatial-spectral quantum feature extraction module. Notably, to ensure that the quantum features contribute genuinely novel information (unaffected by traditional CNN features), we design a separate network track consisting solely of quantum neurons with built-in interpretability. The extracted pure quantum information is then fused with traditional feature information to jointly make the final decision. The proposed quantum-empowered deep network (QEDNet) is very lightweight, so the improvement does come from the cooperation between CNN and QNN (rather than parameter augmentation). Extensive experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the superiority of QEDNet.</description>

      <title>ConcealGS: Concealing Invisible Copyright Information in 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D reconstruction technology, the widespread distribution of 3D data has become a future trend. While traditional visual data (such as images and videos) and NeRF-based formats already have mature techniques for copyright protection, steganographic techniques for the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) format have yet to be fully explored. To address this, we propose ConcealGS, an innovative method for embedding implicit information into 3D-GS. By introducing the knowledge distillation and gradient optimization strategy based on 3D-GS, ConcealGS overcomes the limitations of NeRF-based models and enhances the robustness of implicit information and the quality of 3D reconstruction. We evaluate ConcealGS in various potential application scenarios, and experimental results have demonstrated that ConcealGS not only successfully recovers implicit information but also has almost no impact on rendering quality, providing a new approach for embedding invisible and recoverable information into 3D models in the future.</description>

      <title>Image Segmentation: Inducing graph-based learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance semantic segmentation across diverse image modalities. We evaluate the effectiveness of a novel GNN-based U-Net architecture on three distinct datasets: PascalVOC, a standard benchmark for natural image segmentation, WoodScape, a challenging dataset of fisheye images commonly used in autonomous driving, introducing significant geometric distortions; and ISIC2016, a dataset of dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation. We compare our proposed UNet-GNN model against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models, including U-Net and U-Net++, as well as the transformer-based SwinUNet. Unlike these methods, which primarily rely on local convolutional operations or global self-attention, GNNs explicitly model relationships between image regions by constructing and operating on a graph representation of the image features. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatial relationships, which we hypothesize will be particularly beneficial for handling geometric distortions present in fisheye imagery and capturing intricate boundaries in medical images. Our analysis demonstrates the versatility of GNNs in addressing diverse segmentation challenges and highlights their potential to improve segmentation accuracy in various applications, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Optical Tracking and Imaging of Randomly Moving Targets through Strongly Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking and acquiring simultaneous optical images of randomly moving targets obscured by scattering media remains a challenging problem of importance to many applications that require precise object localization and identification. In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.</description>

      <title>Predicting risk of cardiovascular disease using retinal OCT imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. Non-invasive, cost-effective imaging techniques play a crucial role in early detection and prevention of CVD. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has gained recognition as a potential tool for early CVD risk prediction, though its use remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the potential of OCT as an additional imaging technique to predict future CVD events. We analysed retinal OCT data from the UK Biobank. The dataset included 612 patients who suffered a myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke within five years of imaging and 2,234 controls without CVD (total: 2,846 participants). A self-supervised deep learning approach based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) was used to extract low-dimensional latent representations from high-dimensional 3D OCT images, capturing distinct features of retinal layers. These latent features, along with clinical data, were used to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier to differentiate between patients at risk of future CVD events (MI or stroke) and healthy controls. Our model achieved an AUC of 0.75, sensitivity of 0.70, specificity of 0.70, and accuracy of 0.70, outperforming the QRISK3 score (the third version of the QRISK cardiovascular disease risk prediction algorithm; AUC = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.60, specificity = 0.55, accuracy = 0.55). The choroidal layer in OCT images was identified as a key predictor of future CVD events, revealed through a novel model explainability approach. This study demonstrates that retinal OCT imaging is a cost-effective, non-invasive alternative for predicting CVD risk, offering potential for widespread application in optometry practices and hospitals.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Accelerated MR Cholangiopancreatography without Fully-sampled Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to accelerate MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) acquisitions using deep learning-based (DL) reconstruction at 3T and 0.55T. A total of 35 healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-fold accelerated MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T and 0.55T. We trained DL reconstructions using two different training strategies, supervised (SV) and self-supervised (SSV), with retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtained at 3T. We then evaluated the DL reconstructions against standard techniques, parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. We also tested DL reconstructions with prospectively accelerated acquisitions and evaluated their robustness when changing fields strengths from 3T to 0.55T. DL reconstructions demonstrated a reduction in average acquisition time from 599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective and prospective undersampling, PSNR and SSIM of DL reconstructions were higher than those of PI and CS. At the same time, DL reconstructions preserved the image quality of undersampled data, including sharpness and the visibility of hepatobiliary ducts. In addition, both DL approaches produced high-quality reconstructions at 0.55T. In summary, DL reconstructions trained for highly accelerated MRCP enabled a reduction in acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0 at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of conventional acquisitions.</description>

      <title>ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Image-Level Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14794v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in medical imaging technologies have enabled the collection of longitudinal images, which involve repeated scanning of the same patients over time, to monitor disease progression. However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/ImageFlowNet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the rapid development of computer vision and the emergence of powerful network backbones and architectures, the application of deep learning in medical imaging has become increasingly significant. Unlike natural images, medical images lack huge volumes of data but feature more modalities, making it difficult to train a general model that has satisfactory performance across various datasets. In practice, practitioners often suffer from manually creating and testing models combining independent backbones and architectures, which is a laborious and time-consuming process. We propose Flemme, a FLExible and Modular learning platform for MEdical images. Our platform separates encoders from the model architectures so that different models can be constructed via various combinations of supported encoders and architectures. We construct encoders using building blocks based on convolution, transformer, and state-space model (SSM) to process both 2D and 3D image patches. A base architecture is implemented following an encoder-decoder style, with several derived architectures for image segmentation, reconstruction, and generation tasks. In addition, we propose a general hierarchical architecture incorporating a pyramid loss to optimize and fuse vertical features. Experiments demonstrate that this simple design leads to an average improvement of 5.60% in Dice score and 7.81% in mean interaction of units (mIoU) for segmentation models, as well as an enhancement of 5.57% in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and 8.22% in structural similarity (SSIM) for reconstruction models. We further utilize Flemme as an analytical tool to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of various encoders across different tasks.

      <title>Enhancing the automatic segmentation and analysis of 3D liver vasculature models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identification of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are important for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation, skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing techniques.
  The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skeletonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim, it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.
  The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses of the trees.
  After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.
  In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.</description>

      <title>GDSR: Global-Detail Integration through Dual-Branch Network with Wavelet Losses for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR reconstruction by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose Wavelet Loss, a loss function that effectively captures high-frequency detail information in images, thereby enhancing the visual quality of SR, particularly in terms of detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including AID, AID_CDM, RSSRD-QH, and RSSRD-QH_CDM, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.05 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 2.9 times faster. Furthermore, the Wavelet Loss shows excellent generalization across various architectures, providing a novel perspective for RSI-SR enhancement.</description>

      <title>Diff-Lung: Diffusion-Based Texture Synthesis for Enhanced Pathological Tissue Segmentation in Lung CT Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of the extent of lung pathological patterns (fibrosis, ground-glass opacity, emphysema, consolidation) is prerequisite for diagnosis and follow-up of interstitial lung diseases. However, segmentation is challenging due to the significant class imbalance between healthy and pathological tissues. This paper addresses this issue by leveraging a diffusion model for data augmentation applied during training an AI model. Our approach generates synthetic pathological tissue patches while preserving essential shape characteristics and intricate details specific to each tissue type. This method enhances the segmentation process by increasing the occurence of underrepresented classes in the training data. We demonstrate that our diffusion-based augmentation technique improves segmentation accuracy across all pathological tissue types, particularly for the less common patterns. This advancement contributes to more reliable automated analysis of lung CT scans, potentially improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent F-Numbers Suppress Grating Lobes and Improve the Lateral Resolution in Line-by-Line Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Line-by-line scanning with linear arrays is a standard image formation method in clinical ultrasound. This method examines progressively a given region of interest by conducting focused pulse-echo measurements with dynamic transmit and receive apertures. Such apertures widen with the focal length as a function of a given F-number and improve the image quality by extending the depth of field (DOF) and suppressing grating lobes. Fixed F-numbers, however, limit the lateral resolution. Herein, frequency dependence of the F-number is incorporated into both the transmit and the receive focusing to widen the apertures for low frequencies and improve the lateral resolution. Frequency-dependent transmit and receive F-numbers are proposed. These F-numbers, which can be expressed in closed form, maximize the lateral resolution under constraints on the DOF and the grating lobes. A phantom experiment showed that the proposed F-numbers eliminate grating lobe artifacts and improve both image uniformity and contrast to a similar extent as fixed F-numbers. These metrics, compared to the usage of the full apertures, improved by up to 14.1 % and 8.3 %, respectively. The proposed F-numbers, however, improved the lateral resolution by up to 24 % compared to the fixed F-numbers.</description>

      <title>A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Machine Learning Can Predict Videoconference Fluidity and Enjoyment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Videoconferencing is now a frequent mode of communication in both professional and informal settings, yet it often lacks the fluidity and enjoyment of in-person conversation. This study leverages multimodal machine learning to predict moments of negative experience in videoconferencing. We sampled thousands of short clips from the RoomReader corpus, extracting audio embeddings, facial actions, and body motion features to train models for identifying low conversational fluidity, low enjoyment, and classifying conversational events (backchanneling, interruption, or gap). Our best models achieved an ROC-AUC of up to 0.87 on hold-out videoconference sessions, with domain-general audio features proving most critical. This work demonstrates that multimodal audio-video signals can effectively predict high-level subjective conversational outcomes. In addition, this is a contribution to research on videoconferencing user experience by showing that multimodal machine learning can be used to identify rare moments of negative user experience for further study or mitigation.</description>
