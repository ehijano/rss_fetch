      <title>eDOC: Explainable Decoding Out-of-domain Cell Types with Evidential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology is a powerful tool for unraveling the complexity of biological systems. One of essential and fundamental tasks in scRNA-seq data analysis is Cell Type Annotation (CTA). In spite of tremendous efforts in developing machine learning methods for this problem, several challenges remains. They include identifying Out-of-Domain (OOD) cell types, quantifying the uncertainty of unseen cell type annotations, and determining interpretable cell type-specific gene drivers for an OOD case. OOD cell types are often associated with therapeutic responses and disease origins, making them critical for precision medicine and early disease diagnosis. Additionally, scRNA-seq data contains tens thousands of gene expressions. Pinpointing gene drivers underlying CTA can provide deep insight into gene regulatory mechanisms and serve as disease biomarkers. In this study, we develop a new method, eDOC, to address aforementioned challenges. eDOC leverages a transformer architecture with evidential learning to annotate In-Domain (IND) and OOD cell types as well as to highlight genes that contribute both IND cells and OOD cells in a single cell resolution. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that eDOC significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of OOD cell type and gene driver identification compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that eDOC may provide new insights into single-cell biology.</description>

      <title>Fast and scalable Wasserstein-1 neural optimal transport solver for single-cell perturbation prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting single-cell perturbation responses requires mapping between two unpaired single-cell data distributions. Optimal transport (OT) theory provides a principled framework for constructing such mappings by minimizing transport cost. Recently, Wasserstein-2 ($W_2$) neural optimal transport solvers (\textit{e.g.}, CellOT) have been employed for this prediction task. However, $W_2$ OT relies on the general Kantorovich dual formulation, which involves optimizing over two conjugate functions, leading to a complex min-max optimization problem that converges slowly. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solver based on the Wasserstein-1 ($W_1$) dual formulation. Unlike $W_2$, the $W_1$ dual simplifies the optimization to a maximization problem over a single 1-Lipschitz function, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming min-max optimization. While solving the $W_1$ dual only reveals the transport direction and does not directly provide a unique optimal transport map, we incorporate an additional step using adversarial training to determine an appropriate transport step size, effectively recovering the transport map. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed $W_1$ neural optimal transport solver can mimic the $W_2$ OT solvers in finding a unique and ``monotonic" map on 2D datasets. Moreover, the $W_1$ OT solver achieves performance on par with or surpasses $W_2$ OT solvers on real single-cell perturbation datasets. Furthermore, we show that $W_1$ OT solver achieves $25 \sim 45\times$ speedup, scales better on high dimensional transportation task, and can be directly applied on single-cell RNA-seq dataset with highly variable genes. Our implementation and experiments are open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/poseidonchan/w1ot}.</description>

      <title>PathoGen-X: A Cross-Modal Genomic Feature Trans-Align Network for Enhanced Survival Prediction from Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is essential for personalized cancer treatment. However, genomic data - often a more powerful predictor than pathology data - is costly and inaccessible. We present the cross-modal genomic feature translation and alignment network for enhanced survival prediction from histopathology images (PathoGen-X). It is a deep learning framework that leverages both genomic and imaging data during training, relying solely on imaging data at testing. PathoGen-X employs transformer-based networks to align and translate image features into the genomic feature space, enhancing weaker imaging signals with stronger genomic signals. Unlike other methods, PathoGen-X translates and aligns features without projecting them to a shared latent space and requires fewer paired samples. Evaluated on TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-LUAD, and TCGA-GBM datasets, PathoGen-X demonstrates strong survival prediction performance, emphasizing the potential of enriched imaging models for accessible cancer prognosis.</description>
