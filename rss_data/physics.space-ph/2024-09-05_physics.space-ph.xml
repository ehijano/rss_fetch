      <title>Deciphering Interstellar Ice Morphology: Atomistic Simulations Reveal the Complex Behavior of Ethanethiol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethanethiol (C$_2$H$_5$SH), a molecule detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), indicates the rich chemistry involving sulfur atoms. However, its behavior at low temperatures remains elusive, particularly the reported transition from an amorphous phase to a crystal. This study employs classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reproduce the liquid-state properties of ethanethiol and to simulate the initial amorphous state of ethanethiol films deposited on a KBr substrate. The amorphous ethanethiol did not show spontaneous crystallization upon increasing temperature. Also, ethanethiol ice crystals exhibit melting behavior on KBr substrate at elevated temperatures. Our MD simulations of thin ice samples do not show any signature reversible phase change. It will be interesting to continue this study with a thicker sample, which is beyond our current computational means. These findings underscore the complexity of icy mantle morphology on cold ISM dust grains.</description>

      <title>$1/f$ Noise in the Heliosphere: A Target for PUNCH Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a broad review of 1/f noise observations in the heliosphere, and discuss and complement the theoretical background of generic 1/f models as relevant to NASA's Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) mission. First observed in the voltage fluctuations of vacuum tubes, the scale-invariant 1/f spectrum has since been identified across a wide array of natural and artificial systems, including heart rate fluctuations and loudness patterns in musical compositions. In the solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field trace spectrum exhibits 1/f scaling within the frequency range from around 2e-6 Hz to 1e-4 Hz at 1 au. One compelling mechanism for the generation of 1/f noise is the superposition principle, where a composite 1/f spectrum arises from the superposition of a collection of individual power-law spectra characterized by a scale-invariant distribution of correlation times. In the context of the solar wind, such a superposition could originate from scale-invariant reconnection processes in the corona. Further observations have detected 1/f signatures in the photosphere and corona at frequency ranges compatible with those observed at 1 au, suggesting an even lower altitude origin of 1/f spectrum in the solar dynamo itself. This hypothesis is bolstered by dynamo experiments and simulations that indicate inverse cascade activities, which can be linked to successive flux tube reconnections beneath the corona, and are known to generate 1/f noise possibly through nonlocal interactions at the largest scales. Conversely, models positing in situ generation of 1/f signals face causality issues in explaining the low-frequency portion of the 1/f spectrum. Understanding 1/f noise in the solar wind may inform central problems in heliospheric physics, such as the solar dynamo, coronal heating, the origin of the solar wind, and the nature of interplanetary turbulence.</description>

      <title>Toward Realistic Solar Flare Models: An explicit Particle-In-Cell solver in the DISPATCH framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Simulating solar flares, which involve large-scale dynamics and small-scale magnetic reconnection, poses significant computational challenges. Aims. This study aims to develop an explicit Particle-In-Cell (PIC) solver within the DISPATCH framework to model the small-scale kinetic processes in solar corona setting. This study in the first in a series with the ultimate goal to develop a hybrid PIC-MHD solver, to simulate solar flares. Methods. The PIC solver, inspired by the PhotonPlasma code, solves the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in a collisionless regime using explicit time-staggering and spatial-staggering techniques. Validation included unit tests, plasma frequency recovery, two-stream instability, and current sheet dynamics. Results. Validation tests confirmed the solver's accuracy and robustness in modeling plasma dynamics and electromagnetic fields. Conclusions. The integration of the explicit PIC solver into the DISPATCH framework is the first step towards bridging the gap between large and small scale dynamics, providing a robust platform for future solar physics research.</description>

      <title>Observed Fluctuation Enhancement and Departure from WKB Theory in Sub-Alfv\'enic Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Parker Solar Probe data from orbits 8 through 17, we examine fluctuation amplitudes throughout the critical region where the solar wind flow speed approaches and then exceeds the Alfv\'en wave speed, taking account of various exigencies of the plasma data. In contrast to WKB theory for non-interacting Alfv\'en waves streaming away from the Sun, the magnetic and kinetic fluctuation energies per unit volume are not monotonically decreasing. Instead, there is clear violation of conservation of standard WKB wave action, which is consistent with previous indications of strong in-situ fluctuation energy input in the solar wind near the Alfv\'en critical region. This points to strong violations of WKB theory due to nonlinearity (turbulence) and major energy input near the critical region, which we interpret as likely due to driving by large-scale coronal shear flows.</description>

      <title>Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.</description>
