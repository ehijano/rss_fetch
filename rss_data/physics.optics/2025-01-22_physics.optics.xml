      <title>On photonic band gaps in two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres. Analysis in the vicinity of the low-dielectric light line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider `off-axis' electromagnetic wave propagation down the homogeneous direction of a low-loss two-dimensional periodic dielectric (or photonic crystal fibre) near the light line of the low-dielectric material constituent. Numerous physical and numerical experiments demonstrate the presence of photonic band gaps in the vicinity of this `critical' light line. We mathematically analyse the existence of photonic band gaps near the line and characterise them in terms of frequency gaps in the spectrum of the Maxwell equations restricted to the line. We apply the results to both one-dimensional photonic crystal fibres, and a genuinely two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres with `thin' inclusions, namely ``ARROW'' fibres. In the case of ARROW fibres, by an asymptotic analysis, in terms of the small inclusion parameter, we demonstrate the existence of low frequency photonic band gaps.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation in silicon nitride waveguides integrated with MoS$_2$ monolayers: the importance of a full vectorial modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating 2D materials into on-chip photonic devices holds significant potential for nonlinear frequency conversion across various applications. The lack of inversion symmetry in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), such as MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$, is particularly attractive for enabling nonlinear phenomena based on $\chi^{(2)}$ in silicon photonic devices incorporated with these materials. Previous studies have demonstrated second-order nonlinearities in on-chip silicon-based devices integrated with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, they have largely overlooked the nonlinear modal interaction that considers both the tensorial nature of the TMD's second-order susceptibility and the full vectorial nature of the electromagnetic fields. In this work, we investigate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides integrated with a monolayer of MoS$_2$. We experimentally observed an enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) in MoS$_2$-loaded waveguides compared to those without the monolayer. Notably, this enhancement occurred even when the primary electric field component of the pump and/or signal mode was orthogonal to the TMD plane, highlighting co- and cross-polarized SHG interactions. This phenomenon cannot be predicted by the traditionally used scalar models.In addition, we provide important guidelines for the design of MoS$_2$-loaded waveguides, taking into account phase-matching, interaction length and the MoS$_2$ crystal orientation with respect to the waveguide axis.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal steering of non-diffracting wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of space-time non-diffracting wavepackets, commonly known as light bullets, in a spatiotemporally varying medium. We show that by spatiotemporal refraction, a monochromatic focused beam can be converted to a light bullet that propagates at a given velocity. By further designing the index profile of the spatiotemporal boundary, the group velocity and the propagation direction of the light bullet can be engineered in a programmable way. All effects mentioned above cannot be achieved by spatial or temporal boundaries, and are only possible with spatiotemporal boundaries. These findings provide unique ways to engineer the dynamics of electromagnetic wavepackets in space-time. Such wavepackets with engineered spacetime trajectories may find potential applications in the spatiotemporal control of material properties or particles, or for use as a way to emulate relativistic physics in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Optical Quasiparticles: Skyrmions, Bimerons and Skyrmionic Hopfions in Paraxial Laser Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions, merons, bimerons, and skyrmionic hopfions are quasiparticles which have stable topological textures. They have been observed across multiple physical domains including nucleons, water waves, magnetic materials, electromagnetic fields, condensed-matter physics, liquid crystals, and Bose-Einstein condensates. The nontrivial topological texture of these quasiparticles exhibited promising applications across several research fields including cosmology, particle physics, superfluids, high-energy physics, optics, condensed matter, early-universe cosmology, cold quantum matter, and liquid crystals. These quasiparticles have most recently been observed in paraxial vector beams. Due to the inhomogeneous polarization distribution of vector beams, the quasiparticle textures reside in the Stokes vector fields. Here, we review recent developments in paraxial quasiparticle research and provide detailed information on their fundamental properties and future prospects. We discuss various techniques which have been used to experimentally generate these quasiparticles and we examine a number of their proposed applications. Notably, this review offers insight into the concepts and techniques which can be applied to the generation of optical skyrmions in paraxial laser beams, and investigates their intriguing applications across both fundamental and applied optics.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Cavity Phonon Polaritons in Lead Telluride in the Deep-Strong Coupling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead telluride is an important thermoelectric material due to its large Seebeck coefficient combined with its unusually low thermal conductivity that is related to the strong anharmonicity of phonons in this material. Here, we have studied the resonant and nonperturbative coupling of transverse optical phonons in lead telluride with cavity photons inside small-mode-volume metallic metasurface cavities that have photonic modes with terahertz frequencies. We observed a giant vacuum Rabi splitting on the order of the bare phonon and cavity frequencies. Through terahertz time-domain spectroscopy experiments, we systematically studied the vacuum Rabi splitting as a function of sample thickness, temperature, and cavity length. Under the strongest light-matter coupling conditions, the strength of coupling exceeded the bare phonon and cavity frequencies, putting the system into the deep-strong coupling regime. These results demonstrate that this uniquely tunable platform is promising for realizing and understanding predicted cavity-vacuum-induced ferroelectric instabilities and exploring applications of light-matter coupling in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Ultrashort-Pulse Characterization using Nanophotonic Parametric Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of ultrafast nanophotonic circuits necessitates the development of energy-efficient on-chip pulse characterization techniques. Nanophotonic realizations of Frequency Resolved Optical Gating, a common pulse characterization technique in bulk optics, have been challenging due to their non-collinear nature and the lack of efficient nonlinear optical processes in the integrated platform. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a novel FROG-based technique compatible with the nanophotonic platform that leverages the high gain-bandwidth of a dispersion-engineered degenerate optical parametric amplifier for energy-efficient ultrashort pulse characterization. We demonstrate on-chip pulse characterization of sub-80-fs, ~1-fJ pulses using just ~60-fJ of gate pulse energy, which is several orders of magnitude lower than the gate pulse energy required for characterizing similar pulses in the bulk counterpart. In the future, we anticipate our work will enable the characterization of ultraweak-ultrashort pulses with energies at the single photon level.</description>

      <title>Scaling of nonlinear dynamics driven by stimulated Raman scattering in gas-filled hollow-core fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical systems are scalable under low-intensity illumination since their governing equations are linearly dependent of the optical signal strength. Nonetheless, in high-intensity regimes, the induced polarization becomes nonlinear, rendering the simple scalability of the previous systems invalid. Despite this, canonical nonlinear phenomena such as filamentation and high-harmonic generation in free space have recently been demonstrated to be scalable. Here we will discuss the extension of the scale-invariance paradigm to stimulated Raman scattering and molecular modulation in hollow anti-resonant fibers filled with Raman-active gases. We have found that the complex in-fiber dynamics can be accurately reproduced under very different conditions by keeping the so-called gain reduction factor, that accounts for the coupling of the interacting fields, as well as the dephasing time $T_2$ unaltered. Such scaling strategy enables access to equivalent nonlinear propagation scenarios without sacrificing performance, laying the foundations for to the design of nonlinear devices operating in exotic frequencies, like the ultraviolet, or quantum frequency convertors of non-classical light.</description>

      <title>Remote characterization of aerogel foam concrete using dynamic speckle pattern analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerogel foam concrete (AFC) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its exceptional thermal insulation, lightweight structure, and versatility in construction applications. However, the durability of this material in various chemical environments, particularly acidic and alkaline solutions, remains a critical concern for its long-term performance. In this study, we employed an advanced remote characterization technique-dynamic speckle pattern analysis-to monitor and quantify the degradation and corrosion processes of AFC under these conditions. Using this non-invasive method, we extracted valuable statistical parameters, including the time history of speckle patterns, co-occurrence matrix, inertia moment, Pearson correlation, and roughness indices, to provide a comprehensive analysis of surface and structural changes. Our findings reveal that AFC exposed to acidic environments undergoes faster degradation and more severe surface damage compared to alkaline environments, as demonstrated through $\textit{in situ}$ and remote characterization. These results underscore the importance of understanding material behavior in diverse conditions, offering critical insights for improving the durability of AFC in various applications.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Time-reversal Symmetric Two-Dimensional Photonic Topological Anderson Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the impact of disorder on topological properties has attracted significant attention in photonics, especially the intriguing disorder-induced topological phase transitions in photonic topological Anderson insulators (PTAIs). However, the reported PTAIs are based on time-reversal symmetry broken systems or quasi-three-dimensional time-reversal invariant system, both of which would limit the applications in integrated optics. Here, we realize a time-reversal symmetric two-dimensional PTAI on silicon platform within the near-IR wavelength range, taking the advantageous valley degree of freedom of photonic crystal. A low-threshold topological Anderson phase transition is observed by applying disorder to the critical topologically trivial phase. Conversely, we have also realized extremely robust topologically protected edge states based on the stable topological phase. Both two phenomena are validated through theoretical Dirac Hamiltonian analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental measurements. Our proposed structure holds promise to achieve near-zero topological phase transition thresholds, which breaks the conventional cognition that strong disorder is required to induce the phase transition. It significantly alleviates the difficulty of manipulating disorder and could be extended to other systems, such as condensed matter systems where strong disorder is hard to implement. This work is also beneficial to construct highly robust photonic integrated circuits serving for on-chip photonic and quantum optic information processing. Moreover, this work also provides an outstanding platform to investigate on-chip integrated disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Fibre-coupled photonic crystal hydrophone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications, including medical diagnostics, sonar and navigation rely on the detection of acoustic waves. Photonic hydrophones demonstrate comparable sensitivity to piezoelectric-based hydrophones, but with significantly reduced size, weight and power requirements. In this paper we demonstrate a micron-sized free-standing silicon photonic hydrophone. We demonstrate sensitivity on the order of $\sim$mPa/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ from 10-200 kHz, with a minimum detectable pressure of 145 $\mu$Pa/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ at 22 kHz. We also deployed our hydrophone in a wave flume to evaluate its suitability for underwater measurement and communication. Our hydrophone matches the sensitivity of commercial hydrophones, but is many orders of magnitude smaller in volume, which could enable high spatial resolution imaging of micron-sized acoustic features (i.e., living cell vibrations). Our hydrophone could also be used in underwater communication and imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Incoherent lateral shearing digital holographic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to resolve and quantify features at submicrometer scales from a single-shot image is crucial for real-time uncovering intricate structures in unlabeled biological samples and analyzing them at the subcellular level. We introduce a novel incoherent quantitative phase imaging technique based on lateral shearing digital holographic microscopy, with shearing distances exceeding the coherence area of the employed illumination -- a regime not previously achieved and exploited. This strategy consequently assures artifacts-free, high-accuracy, and high-resolution quantitative phase reconstructions. This regime extends the single-shot lateral shearing digital holographic microscopy towards incoherent illumination, thus increasing the space-time bandwidth product of the method. The practical common-path geometry also provides enhanced vibration resistance, which is essential for consistent time-lapse measurements. We verify the scalability and effectiveness of the method by investigating samples via multiple condenser-objective pairs, providing a wide range of lateral resolutions and fields of view, thereby assuring its applicability for various microscope settings. We experimentally verify long-term phase stability and unprecedented phase-reconstruction accuracy. Finally, we use our method for investigation of biological samples, including cheek cells, diatoms, and yeast cells, highlighting its potential for dynamic label-free analysis at the organelle level.</description>

      <title>Superheterodyne Rydberg S-band receiver with a multi-tone local oscillator based on an atomic transition loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-vapor sensors based on Rydberg atoms now face a transition towards practical applications, with several outstanding challenges. To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell. This local oscillator hinders several advantages of the sensor, such as stealthy and all-optical operation. We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</description>

      <title>Perfect Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) with transverse orbital angular momentum have emerged as a significant research topic. While various STOV fields have been explored, they often suffer from a critical limitation: the spatial and temporal dimentions of the STOV wavepacket are strongly correlated with the topological charge. This dependence hinders the simultaneous achievement of high spatial accuracy and high topological charge. To address this limitation, we theoretically and experimentally investigate a new class of STOV wavepackets generated through the spatiotemporal Fourier transform of polychromatic Bessel-Gaussian beams, which we term as perfect spatiotemporal optical vortices. Unlike conventional STOVs, perfect STOVs exhibit spatial and temporal diameters that are independent of the topological charge. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generation of spatiotemporal optical vortex lattices by colliding perfect STOV wavepackets, enabling flexible manipulation of the number and sign of sub-vortices.</description>

      <title>Tunable coherence laser interferometry: demonstrating 40dB of straylight suppression and compatibility with resonant optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are parasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which can cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser interferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their sensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the influence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances into phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By artificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise (PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed. As it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice the coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB in a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm. We probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the PRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the presence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with and without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and the PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale waveguide sidewall roughness scattering loss characterization by image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are vital for developing affordable, high-performance optoelectronic devices that can be manufactured at an industrial scale, driving innovation and efficiency in various applications. Optical loss of modes in thin film waveguides and devices is a critical measure of their performance. Thin films growth, lithography, masking, and etching processes are imperfect processes that introduce significant sidewall and top-surface roughness and cause dominating optical losses in waveguides and photonic structures. These roughness as perturbations couple light from guided to far-field radiation modes, leading to scattering losses that can be estimated from theoretical models. Typically, with UV-based lithography sidewall roughness is found to be significantly larger than wafer-top surface roughness. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging measurement gives 3D and high-resolution roughness profile but the measurement is inconvenient, costly, and unscalable for large-scale PICs and at wafer-scale. Here, we evaluate the sidewall roughness profile based on 2D high-resolution scanning electron microscope imaging. We characterized the loss on two homemade nitride and oxide films on 3-inch silicon wafers with 12 waveguide devices on each and co-related the scattering loss estimated from a 2D image-based sidewall profile and theoretical Payne model. The lowest loss of guided fundamental transverse electric (TE$_{0}$) is found at 0.075 dB/cm at 633 nm across 24 devices, which is a record at visible wavelength. Our work shows a 100% success in edge detection in image processing to estimate autocorrelation function and optical mode loss. These demonstrations offer valuable insights into waveguide sidewall roughness and comparison of experimental and 2D SEM image-processing-based loss estimations.</description>

      <title>Universal programmable and self-configuring optical filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11811v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to integrated optical spectral filtering that allows arbitrary programmability, can compensate automatically for imperfections in filter fabrication, allows multiple simultaneous and separately programmable filter functions on the same input, and can configure itself automatically to the problem of interest, for example to filter or reject multiple arbitrarily chosen frequencies. The approach exploits splitting the input light into an array of multiple waveguides of different lengths that then feed a programmable interferometer array that can also self-configure. It can give spectral response similar to arrayed waveguide gratings but offers many other filtering functions, as well as supporting other structures based on non-redundant arrays for precise spectral filtering. Simultaneous filtering also allows, for the first time to our knowledge, an automatic measurement of the temporal coherency matrix and physical separation into the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion of temporally partially coherent light fields.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal metasurfaces with epsilon-near-zero materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal optics enables asymmetric transmission of light when its sources and detectors are exchanged. A canonical example -- optical isolator -- enables light propagation in only one direction, similar to how electrical diodes enable unidirectional flow of electric current. Nonreciprocal optics today, unlike nonreciprocal electronics, remains bulky. Recently, nonlinear metasurfaces opened up a pathway to strong optical nonreciprocity at the nanoscale. However, demonstrations to date were based on optically slow nonlinearities involving thermal effects or phase transition materials. In this work, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal metasurface with an ultra-fast optical response based on indium tin oxide in its epsilon-near-zero regime. It operates in the spectral range of 1200-1300 nm with incident power densities of 40-70 GW/cm$^2$. Furthermore, the nonreciprocity of the metasurface extends to both amplitude and phase of the forward/backward transmission opening a pathway to nonreciprocal wavefront control at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an accurate imaging theory for optical coherence tomography/microscopy (OCT/OCM) without approximations to calculate precise optical resolution and imaging characteristics. Our theory represents a broadband light source using a four-dimensional (4D) pupil function with a dimension for light frequency (reciprocal of wavelength) as the fourth axis in 4D frequency space. Consequently, 4D space-time representation is required in real space, connected to the 4D frequency space by a 4D Fourier transform. Our theory provides insight into a peculiar image formation in OCT/OCM, particularly when an apparatus has a high numerical aperture (NA) optical system to handle aberrations and dispersions simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Unified image formation theory for microscopy and optical coherence tomography in 4-D space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an image formation theory that covers the majority of optical microscopy techniques that use diverse coherent or incoherent light-matter interactions. The theories of individual microscopy methods could not previously be connected with other systems because of the absence of a common theoretical framework. Using the general principles of quantum physics and applying a four-dimensional representation, we unify the image formation theories of optical systems ranging from classical microscopy to cutting-edge instruments into a single framework in which light is replaced with quantum fields and the interactions are represented using double-sided Feynman diagrams. Our universal methodology requires a four-dimensional aperture that enables sufficient understanding of the associations between the different imaging types and interprets image formation appropriately for all systems, including optical coherence tomography.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Electrostatic Interaction and Steric Repulsion between Bacteria and Gold Surface Influences Raman Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures have wide applications in photonics including pathogen detection and diagnosis via Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Despite major role plasmonics play in signal enhancement, electrostatics in SERS is yet to be fully understood and harnessed. Here, we perform a systematic study of electrostatic interactions between 785 nm resonant gold nanorods designed to harbor zeta potentials of +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV spanning positive neutral and negative domains. SERS activity is tested on representative Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria with zeta potentials of -30 and -23 mV respectively in water. Raman spectroscopy and Cryo-Electron microscopy reveal that +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV nanorods give SERS enhancement of 7.2X, 3.6X, 4.2X, 1.3X to Staphylococcus epidermidis and 3.9X, 2.8X, 2.9X, 1.1X to Escherichia coli. Theoretical results show that electrostatics play the major role among all interaction forces in determining cell-nanorod proximity and signal enhancement. We identify steric repulsion due to cell protrusions to be the critical opposing force. Finally, a design principle is proposed to estimate the electrostatic strength in SERS. Our work provides new insights into the principle of bacteria-nanorod interactions, enabling reproducible and precise biomolecular readouts, critical for next-generation point-of-care diagnostics and smart healthcare applications.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the spatiotemporal solitary waves of a graded-index multimode optical fiber with a parabolic transverse index profile. Using the nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation approach, we derive an effective one-dimensional Lagrangian associated with the Laguerre-Gauss modes with a generic radial mode number p and azimuthal index m. We show that the form of the equations of motion for any Laguerre-Gauss mode is particularly simple, and we derive the critical power for the collapse for every mode. By solving the nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation, we provide a comparison of the stationary mode profiles in the radial and temporal coordinates.</description>

      <title>Influence of conjugated structure for tunable molecular plasmons in peropyrene and its derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in research have sparked an increasing curiosity in understanding the plasmonic excitation properties of molecular-scale systems. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as the fundamental building blocks of graphene, have been documented to possess plasmonic properties through experimental observations, making them prime candidates for investigation. By doping different elements, the conjugated structure of the molecule can be altered. In this study, the plasmonic excitation properties influenced by conjugated structures in peropyrene and its derivatives are investigated through first-principles calculations that combine the plasmonicity index, generalized plasmonicity index and transition contribution maps. For molecular plasmonic excitation, the conjugated structure can influence the oscillation modes of valence electrons, which is pivotal in yielding distinct field enhancement characteristics. Furthermore, charge doping can lead to a certain degree of alteration in the conjugated structures, and the doping of elements will result in varying degrees of such alteration, thereby initiating different trends in the evolution of plasmonic resonance. This further enhances the tunability of molecular plasmonic resonance. The results provide novel insights into the development and utilization of molecular plasmonic devices in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Two-photon Interference of Biphotons Emitted by Overlapping Resonances in Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon interference, a quantum phenomenon arising from the principle of indistinguishability, is a powerful tool for quantum state engineering and plays a fundamental role in various quantum technologies. These technologies demand robust and efficient sources of quantum light, as well as scalable, integrable and multifunctional platforms. In this regard, quantum optical metasurfaces (QOMs) are emerging as promising platforms for quantum light generation, namely biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), and its engineering. Due to the relaxation of phase matching, SPDC in QOMs allows different channels of biphoton generation, such as those supported by overlapping resonances, to occur simultaneously. In previously reported QOMs, however, SPDC was too weak to observe such effects. Here we develop QOMs based on [110]-oriented GaAs that provide more than an order of magnitude enhancement in SPDC rate, after accounting for the spectral bandwidth, compared to any other QOMs studied to date. This boosted efficiency allows the QOMs support the simultaneous generation of SPDC from several spectrally overlapping optical modes. Using polarization components in the interferometer analyzer, we intentionally erase the distinguishability between the biphotons from a high-$Q$ quasi-bound-state-in-the-continuum resonance and a low-$Q$ Mie resonance, which results in the first-time observation of two-photon interference in the spectral domain in these types of devices. This quantum interference can considerably enrich the generation of entangled photons in metasurfaces. Their advanced multifunctionality, improved nonlinear response, ease of fabrication and compact footprint of [110]-GaAs QOMs position them as promising platforms to fulfill the requirements for photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of a feedback oscillators realized by a phase-insensitive amplifier in positive feedback, where either the amplifier or the feedback element may determine the oscillator's linewidth. The spectral purity of the output of such a device originates from basic demands of quantum mechanics and causality. The resulting expression generalizes the Schawlow-Townes limit, which is itself one component of a standard quantum limit for feedback oscillators. Recently realized bad-cavity oscillators such as super-radiant lasers and solid-state masers can saturate this generalized Schawlow-Townes limit. This limit can be surpassed through appropriate quantum engineering: for example by atomic spin squeezing in a super-radiant laser.</description>

      <title>Forward Raman Scattering and Self-Modulation instabilities of lasers in magnetized tapered plasma channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of laser pulses in tapered magnetized plasma channels is analyzed using the fluid theory of cold plasmas. This study focuses on laser propagation's key instabilities: forward Raman scattering and self-modulation instability. The influence of plasma density, laser intensity, dc magnetic field strength, and laser polarization on the growth rates of these instabilities is thoroughly examined. Analytical and numerical computations of the number of e-foldings for forward Raman scattering are performed to quantify its impact. The results reveal that increased plasma density and laser intensity significantly enhance the growth rates of these instabilities, leading to amplified Raman-scattered wave intensity and modulation of the laser envelope. Moreover, the strength of the dc magnetic field plays a pivotal role: it boosts instability growth rates for right-handed circularly polarized laser pulses while suppressing them for left-handed circularly polarized pulses. These findings highlight that reducing the growth rates of instabilities can facilitate the stable propagation of laser pulses in tapered plasma channels.</description>

      <title>Wakefield-induced THz wave generation in a hybrid dielectric-plasma cylindrical waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, the generation of THz radiation through wakefield excitation in a cylindrical dielectric plasma waveguide is investigated. The proposed hybrid dielectric-plasma wakefield structure combines the advantages of dielectric materials and plasma, creating a versatile platform for high-performance applications and advanced THz radiation generation. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, this hybrid configuration achieves enhanced gradients and optimized THz wave output. The mechanism involves a high-energy laser pulse propagating through a plasma-loaded dielectric waveguide, inducing wakefields that drive THz wave emission. This dual capability underscores the versatility of the proposed structure, offering significant advancements in THz wave generation technologies. To support the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations were employed using the Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) method and the COMSOL Multiphysics package. The simulation modeled the wakefield generation process and validated the propagation of electromagnetic waves. A comprehensive parametric study examined the effects of various parameters including dielectric thickness, an external DC magnetic field, laser pulse length, driver beam radius, and total current, on the wakefield generated THz radiation. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the study aims to elucidate the controlled features of the resulting fields and optimize THz radiation.</description>

      <title>State Transfer in Latent-Symmetric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of quantum states is a crucial aspect of information processing systems, facilitating operations such as quantum key distribution and inter-component communication within quantum computers. Most quantum networks rely on symmetries to achieve an efficient state transfer. A straightforward way to design such networks is to use spatial symmetries, which severely limits the design space. Our work takes a novel approach to designing photonic networks that do not exhibit any conventional spatial symmetries, yet nevertheless support an efficient transfer of quantum states. Paradoxically, while a perfect transfer efficiency is technically unattainable in these networks, a fidelity arbitrarily close to unity is always reached within a finite time of evolution. Key to this approach are so-called latent, or 'hidden', symmetries, which are embodied in the spectral properties of the network. Latent symmetries substantially expand the design space of quantum networks and hold significant potential for applications in quantum cryptography and secure state transfer. We experimentally realize such a nine-site latent-symmetric network and successfully observe state transfer between two sites with a measured fidelity of 75%. Furthermore, by launching a two-photon state, we show that quantum interference is preserved by the network. This demonstrates that the latent symmetries enable efficient quantum state transfer, while offering greater flexibility in designing quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Schr\"odinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</description>

      <title>Helical dichroism for hybridized quadrupole plasmon modes in twisted nanorods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03422v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helical dichroism (HD), originating from the interplay between chiral plasmonic structures and left and right vortex light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), has attracted significant attention across various disciplines owing to its implications in fundamental physics and applications. However, the precise relationship between HD and the excited plasmon modes remains elusive. Owing to the weak chiroptical response to OAM light, chiral structures have required dimensions larger than the incident light wavelength to obtain observable HD signals, resulting in complex superpositions of higher-order plasmon modes. In this work, we reveal that a simple twisted nanorod dimer with a size smaller than the incident light wavelength, exhibits remarkable HD due to the strong coupling between quadrupole plasmon modes excited in the nanorods, followed by the plasmon hybridization. Positive and negative HD responses were measured at different resonance wavelengths corresponding to two hybridized quadrupole modes, in good agreement with the calculated results. This spectral behavior of the HD is clearly different from that of the circular dichroism (CD) based on spin angular momentum (SAM) of light, indicating that the quadrupole HD arises from the OAM rather than the SAM. These findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of light-matter interactions concerning angular momentum.</description>

      <title>High Transmission in 120-degree Sharp Bends of Inversion-symmetric and Inversion-asymmetric Photonic Crystal Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bending loss is one of the serious problems for constructing nanophotonic integrated circuits. Recently, many works reported that valley photonic crystals (VPhCs) enable significantly high transmission via 120-degree sharp bends. However, it is unclear whether the high bend-transmission results directly from the valley-photonic effects, which are based on the breaking of inversion symmetry. In this study, we conduct a series of comparative numerical and experimental investigations of bend-transmission in various triangular PhCs with and without inversion symmetry and reveal that the high bend-transmission is solely determined by the domain-wall configuration and independent of the existence of the inversion symmetry. Preliminary analysis of the polarization distribution indicates that high bend-transmissions are closely related to the appearance of local topological polarization singularities near the bending section. Our work demonstrates that high transmission can be achieved in a much wider family of PhC waveguides, which may provide novel designs for low-loss nanophotonic integrated circuits with enhanced flexibility and a new understanding of the nature of valley-photonics</description>

      <title>Non-uniform wave momentum bandgap in biaxial anisotropic photonic time crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PTCs) host momentum bandgaps enabling intriguing non-resonant light amplification in propagating waves, but opening substantial bandgaps demands refractive index changes too extreme for conventional nonlinear optics. Here, we introduce momentum bandgaps for non-uniform waves, including evanescent and ghost types, by extending PTCs to biaxial anisotropic photonic time crystals that periodically alternate between uniform biaxial anisotropy and isotropic media over time. We show that ghost waves, unlike evanescent waves, sustain only momentum bandgaps, opening wide bandgaps at even the smallest modulation depths. Moreover, we demonstrate momentum bandgap effects on non-uniform waves that can be amplified, or through decaying modes, selectively attenuated. We find that ghost wave momentum bandgaps uniquely boost refracted over reflected waves under one-way incidence, in stark contrast to balanced amplification seen in both propagating and evanescent waves. Our approach expands time-varying metamaterials by integrating wave characteristics, bridging the gap between conventional nonlinear optics and PTC momentum bandgaps, and shedding new light on extreme manipulation of surface polaritons.</description>

Abstract: Most modern imaging systems process the data they capture computationally, either to make the measurement more interpretable for human viewing or to analyze it without a human in the loop. As a result, what matters is not how measurements appear visually, but how much information they contain. Information theory provides mathematical tools to quantify this; however, it has found limited use in imaging system design due to the challenge of developing methods that can handle the complexity of real-world measurements yet remain practical enough for widespread use. We introduce a data-driven approach for estimating the information content of imaging system measurements in order to evaluate system performance and optimize designs. Our framework requires only a dataset of experimental measurements and a means for noise characterization, enabling its use in real systems without ground truth data. We validate that these information estimates reliably predict system performance across diverse imaging modalities, including color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and label-free microscopy. We further introduce an optimization technique called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) for designing imaging systems that maximize information capture. This work unlocks information theory as a powerful, practical tool for analyzing and designing imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

      <title>A general design method for ultra-long optical path length multipass matrix cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we propose a general design method for ultra-long optical path length (OPL) multipass matrix cells (MMCs) based on multi-cycle mode of two-sided field mirrors. The design idea of the dual circulation mode with two-sided field mirrors is elaborated in detail with the example of MMC based on dual Pickett Bradley White cell (PBWC), and the simple design methods of the other three MMCs based on the dual circulation mode of PBWC and Bernstein Herzberg White cell (BHWC) are given. Further, we propose a general design method for ultra-long OPL MMCs with multi-cycle mode by adding cyclic elements. The OPL of the MMCs designed by this method can reach the order of kilometers or even tens of kilometers. The novel MMCs have the advantages of simple structure, strong spot formation regularity, easy expansion, high mirror utilization ratio, high reuse times of spot spatial position, good stability and extremely high ratio of the optical path length to the volume (RLV). In order to evaluate the performance of the new MMCs, an open-path methane gas sensor with the MMC based on triple PBWC was constructed, which was used to continuously measure the methane in the laboratory, and the feasibility, effectiveness and practicability of the new design method were verified. The design method proposed in this paper provides a new idea for the design of multipass cell (MPC), and the new MMCs designed have great potential application value in the field of high-precision trace gas monitoring.</description>

      <title>Observation of condensed moire exciton polaritons in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moire lattices attract significant attention in double-layer graphene and TMD layer heterostructures as well as in photonic crystals due to the interesting exotic physics that emerges within these structures. However, direct measurement of the moir\'e ground, excited states and Bloch bands in twisted photonic lattices is still illusive. In this work we report strong coupling between excitons in CsPbBr3 microplates and moire photonic modes at room temperature. Depending on the coupling strength between the nearest potential sites, we observe staggered moire polariton ground states, excited states and moire polariton bands. Phase locked moire zero (in-phase) states and moire pi (antiphase) states with different spatial distributions are measured. The moire polariton distribution can be tuned into the shape of a parallelogram by controlling the depth and width of the potential in one photonic lattice with another superimposed one fixed. In addition, moire polaritons in twisted 2D honeycomb lattices are also observed. Increasing the pumping density, we realize exciton polariton condensation in the moire potential sites of the 1D/2D twisted lattices with the coherence time of around 1.4 ps. Our work lays the foundation to study coherent moire polariton condensation in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-time modulation of electromagnetic parameters offers novel exciting possibilities for advanced field manipulations. In this study, we explore wave scattering from a time-varying interface characterized by a Lorentz-type dispersion with a step-like temporal variation in its parameters. Our findings reveal a new process: an unconventional frequency generation at the natural resonances of the system. Remarkably, this phenomenon enables the coupling of propagating waves to evanescent ones, allowing the direct far-field excitation of surface-wave modes without the mediation of spatial gratings or prisms. These results suggest a novel strategy for designing compact and ultra-fast photonic devices, eliminating the necessity for subwavelength spatial structuring or prolonged temporal modulations.</description>

      <title>Implicitly Learned Neural Phase Functions for Basis-Free Point Spread Function Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point spread function (PSF) engineering is vital for precisely controlling the focus of light in computational imaging, with applications in neural imaging, fluorescence microscopy, and biophotonics. The PSF is derived from the magnitude of the Fourier transform of a phase function, making the construction of the phase function given the PSF (PSF engineering) an ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional PSF engineering methods rely on physical basis functions, limiting their ability to generalize across the range of PSFs required for imaging tasks. We introduce a novel approach leveraging implicit neural representations that overcome the limitations of pixel-wise optimization methods. Our approach achieves a median MSSIM of 0.8162 and a mean MSSIM of 0.5634, compared to a median MSSIM of 0.0 and a mean MSSIM of 0.1841 with pixel-wise optimization when learning randomly generated phase functions. Our approach also achieves a median PSNR of 10.38 dB and a mean PSNR of 8.672 dB, compared to a median PSNR of 6.653 dB and a mean PSNR of 6.660 dB with pixel-wise optimization for this task.</description>

      <title>On the localisation of the high-intensity region of simultaneous space-time foci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous space-time focusing (SSTF) is sometimes claimed to reduce the longitudinal extent of the high-intensity region near the focus, in contradiction to the original work on this topic. Here we seek to address this confusion by using numerical and analytical methods to investigate the degree of localisation of the spatio-temporal intensity of an SSTF pulse. The analytical method is found to be in excellent agreement with numerical calculations and yields, for bi-Gaussian input pulses, expressions for the three-dimensional spatio-temporal intensity profile of the SSTF pulse, and for the on-axis bandwidth, pulse duration, and pulse-front tilt (PFT) of the SSTF pulse. To provide further insight, we propose a method for determining the transverse input profile of a non-SSTF pulse with equivalent spatial focusing. We find that the longitudinal variations of the peak axial intensities of the SSTF and spatially equivalent (SE) pulses are the same, apart from a constant factor, and hence that SSTF does not constrain the region of high intensity more than a non-SSTF pulse with equivalent focusing. We demonstrate that one possible cause of confusion in the literature arises from the fact that a simplistic method for calculating the pulse intensity exaggerates the degree of intensity localisation, unless the spatio-temporal couplings inherent to SSTF pulses are accounted for.</description>

Abstract: Dense lattices of photonic crystals can serve as artificial materials, with light propagation in these structures described by effective material parameters that surpass the capabilities of natural materials. In this study, we introduce a metamaterial that supports quadrupole magnetization, a characteristic rarely observed in existing structures. We experimentally demonstrate a magnetic quadrupole metamaterial associated with Mie-resonance-excited stop bands below the Bragg band. Additionally, we develop a theoretical model that addresses both dispersion and boundary conditions within this framework. Using a Fabry-Perot resonator as a case study, we validate our model and reveal that the quadrupole metamaterial can exhibit a markedly different reflection/transmission spectrum, including zero reflection at normal incidence. Our findings underscore the practical potential for both experimental and theoretical investigations of metamaterials that extend beyond the dipole approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional wavefront control in high-energy, high-intensity laser systems usually lacks real-time capability, failing to address dynamic aberrations. This limits experimental accuracy due to shot-to-shot fluctuations and necessitates long cool-down phases to mitigate thermal effects, particularly as higher repetition rates become essential, e.g. in Inertial Fusion research. This paper details the development and implementation of a real-time capable adaptive optics system at the Apollon laser facility. Inspired by astronomical adaptive optics, the system uses a fiber-coupled 905 nm laser diode as a pilot beam that allows for spectral separation, bypassing the constraints of pulsed lasers. A GPU-based controller, built on the open-source CACAO framework, manages a loop comprising a bimorph deformable mirror and high-speed Shack-Hartmann sensor. Initial tests showed excellent stability and effective aberration correction. However, integration into the Apollon laser revealed critical challenges unique to the laser environment that must be resolved to ensure safe operation with amplified shots.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Geometry of Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Enabled by Magnetization Multipole of Berry Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) is a fundamental tool in magnetometry, pivotal for advancing research in optics, magnetism, and spintronics as a direct probe of magnetization. Traditional MOKE measurements primarily detect the magnetization components parallel to the Poynting vector, which can only access the magnitude but not the direction of the orthogonal component. In this study, we introduce an orthogonal MOKE geometry in which the Kerr signal detects both the magnitude and direction of the magnetization component perpendicular to the Poynting vector. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this orthogonal geometry through the MOKE measurements in cubic ferromagnets and van der Waals ferromagnet. We theoretically show that the orthogonal MOKE geometry is enabled by the multipolar structure of Berry curvature in the magnetization space, which generally induces a Voigt vector orthogonal to the magnetization, thereby accounting for the unique magnetization angle dependence distinct from conventional MOKE. The establishment of the orthogonal MOKE geometry not only introduces a new paradigm for magneto-optical measurements but also provides a framework for exploring the magnetization multipoles of Berry curvature across the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</description>

      <title>Using hyperspectral imaging to identify optimal narrowband filter parameters for construction and demolition waste classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is widely applied in various industries, enabling detailed analysis of material properties or composition through their spectral signatures. However, for classification of construction and demolition waste (CDW) materials, HSI is impractical since real-time sorting requires rapid data acquisition and lightweight classification. Instead, fitting selected narrowband filters onto standard cameras can achieve comparable results with substantially reduced computational overhead. In this study, reflectance data of common CDW materials were recorded using a hyperspectral camera, and a multilayer perceptron classifier was employed to evaluate different feature sets. The findings indicate that adding only two wavelengths beyond the RGB channels is sufficient for high-accuracy classification, with optimal filter central wavelengths identified at approximately 650-750 nm and 850-1000 nm across the tested bandwidths (5-50 nm) highlighting the importance of near-infrared regions for material discrimination.</description>

      <title>Myasthenia Gravis Diagnosis with Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02014v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a diagnostic tool for myasthenia gravis, a severe neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. Blood serum samples were analyzed using SERS substrates embedded with 5 nm gold nanoparticles, resulting in significant Raman signal enhancement and the detection of disease-specific spectral features. The study demonstrates the potential of SERS to identify subtle biochemical changes associated with oxidative stress and altered molecular composition in serum, providing a sensitive and non-invasive approach for diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Multiparameter Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an innovative, platform-independent concept for multiparameter sensing where the measurable parameters are in series, or cascaded, enabling measurements as a function of position. With temporally resolved detection, we show that squeezing can give a quantum enhancement in sensitivity over that of classical states by a factor of $e^{2r}$, where $r \approx 1$ is the squeezing parameter. As an example, we have modeled an interferometer that senses multiple phase shifts along the same path, demonstrating a maximal quantum advantage by combining a coherent state with squeezed vacuum. Further classical modeling with up to 100 phases shows linear scaling potential for adding nodes to the sensor. The approach represents a new paradigm in multiparameter quantum metrology, and can be applied to remote sensing, geophysical surveying, and infrastructure monitoring.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase-transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex, which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot-spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which give the sets of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot-spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <title>Tactile Displays Driven by Projected Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile displays that lend tangible form to digital content could transform computing interactions. However, achieving the resolution, speed, and dynamic range needed for perceptual fidelity remains challenging. We present a tactile display that directly converts projected light into visible tactile patterns via a photomechanical surface populated with millimeter-scale optotactile pixels. The pixels transduce incident light into mechanical displacements through photostimulated thermal gas expansion, yielding millimeter scale displacements with response times of 2 to 100 milliseconds. Employing projected light for power transmission and addressing renders these displays highly scalable. We demonstrate optically driven displays with up to 1,511 addressable pixels -- several times more pixels than any prior tactile display attaining comparable performance. Perceptual studies confirm that these displays can reproduce diverse spatiotemporal tactile patterns with high fidelity. This research establishes a foundation for practical, versatile high-resolution tactile displays driven by light.</description>

      <title>Spin Photonic Topological Insulator Antenna By Armchair Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new X-band leaky wave antenna has been developed using spin photonic topological insulators. This antenna features a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This arrangement provides advantages over the zigzag configuration, particularly by offering a wider leaky region and a more suitable pattern. To design the structure, a parametric study on the cell dimensions has been conducted, and another study has designed the transition region to couple the topological structure with the classical line. The proposed antenna has a low profile and illuminates two sides of the structure simultaneously. Additionally, it offers a 53-degree scanning range and a bandwidth of 2.7 GHz, making it a groundbreaking improvement over other leaky wave antennas that utilize photonic topological insulators. The proposed antenna is an unbalanced Composite Right/Left-Handed (CRLH) leaky wave antenna capable of radiating in both backward and forward directions. Notably, as it transitions through the broadside within its scanning range, there is no significant drop in performance, even in the presence of an open stop band. To the best of our knowledge, this characteristic is unique among unbalanced CRLH leaky wave antennas.</description>

      <title>Tailored Thin Films: Modulating Soft Photonics with Dynamically Tunable Large Area Microstructures via Controlled Thermal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-assembled nano and micro-structures, particularly those capable of responsive erasure and regeneration, have garnered significant interest for their applications in smart photonics and electronics. However, current techniques for modulating these architectures largely depend on network rearrangement, posing challenges for in situ regeneration. Furthermore, their common fabrication techniques are complex and uncontrolled with the structures formed not being amenable for large area applications, thus compromising their economic viability. Herein, we present a controlled thermal process strategy for fabricating large-area, dynamically tunable, 1D,2D and 3D micro and nanostructures on a wide range of compatible materials including metals, semiconductors and polymers. By tuning the temperature changes in the system, thermal expansion coefficients of thin films and substrates, surface energy, Youngs modulus and thickness of the thin films we achieve robust, uniform, periodic structures over extensive areas on soft and stretchable substrates. The process is further supported by a theoretical model that we developed and validated by experiments and simulations. To showcase the robustness of our approach, we present prototypes of dynamically tunable diffraction gratings, optical diffusers, large-area reflective displays, camouflage devices, out-coupling efficiency enhancers, wearable devices and mechanochromic sensors.</description>
