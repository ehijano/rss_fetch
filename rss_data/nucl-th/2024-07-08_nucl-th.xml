      <title>Magnetic structure of $A \le 10$ nuclei using the Norfolk nuclear models with quantum Monte Carlo methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of magnetic moments, form factors, and densities of $A\le 10$ nuclei within a chiral effective field theory approach. We use the Norfolk two- and three-body chiral potentials and their consistent electromagnetic one- and two-nucleon current operators. We find that two-body contributions to the magnetic moment can be large (up to $\sim33\%$ in $A=9$ systems). We study the model dependence of these observables and place particular emphasis on investigating their sensitivity to using different cutoffs to regulate the many-nucleon operators. Calculations of elastic magnetic form factors for $A\leq 10$ nuclei show excellent agreement with the data out to momentum transfers $q\approx 3$ fm$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Statistical Production of $B_c$ Mesons in Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recombination production of $B_c$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energy is facilitated by the abundant and highly thermalized charm ($c$) quarks transported in the deconfined medium created. We study the production of $B_c$ mesons via $c$ and bottom ($b$) quark recombination in a statistical fashion by placing $B_c$ in the position of a member of the family of open $b$ hadrons, which allows us to make quantitative predictions for the modifications of the production fraction ($f_c$) of $B_c$ mesons and its relative production to $B$ mesons in $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at the same energy. The statistical production yield of $B_c$ mesons is converted into the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution with the shape computed from resonance recombination using the $c$- and $b$-quark phase space distributions that have been simulated via Langevin diffusion and constrained by open $c$- and $b$-hadron observables. Supplemented with the component fragmented from $b$-quark spectrum that dominates at high $p_T$, the total $p_T$ spectrum of $B_c$ mesons is obtained and converted into the $p_T$ dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$). Both $f_c$ and the integrated $R_{\rm AA}$ exhibit a $\sim5$-fold enhancement in central Pb-Pb collisions relative to the $pp$ reference. Comparison with data measured by the CMS experiment shows decent agreement within theoretical and experimental uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Quantifying angular distributions in multinucleon transfer reactions with a semi-classical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multinucleon transfer (MNT) process in low-energy heavy ion collisions can be utilized to produce unknown nuclei far beyond the stability line. However, the reaction products exhibit broad angular and energy distributions, which could lower the experimental detection efficiency. We present a classical approach that employs a parameterized angular distribution to describe the complex issue. By analyzing limited experimental data on angular distribution, we proposed a three-parameter formula to calculate the angular distribution and identified the dependencies of the parameters. We also discuss the sensitivity of these parameters within this method. A comprehensive comparison with microscopic models and experimental data across a wide range of conditions is conducted. The proposed formula offers an efficient and straightforward way to determine the angular distribution of MNT products.</description>

      <title>Significance of tensor force in pseudo-spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the pseudo-spin symmetry (PSS) of nuclei significantly depends on the proton ($Z$) and neutron numbers ($N$), sometimes giving rise to the characteristic structures. By using the non-relativistic spherical Hartree-Fock calculation with a realistic tensor force, we show that the tensor force may be deeply relevant to the $Z$- and $N$-dependence of the PSS. While the PSS has often been discussed in the context of the relativistic symmetry, the tensor-force effects on the PSS sometimes look analogous to the $Z$-and $N$-dependence of the PSS in the relativistic mean-field (RMF) calculations without explicit tensor force. The observed variation of the $p0d_{3/2}$-$p1s_{1/2}$ levels from $^{40}$Ca to $^{34}$Si is consistent with the tensor-force-driven $Z$-dependence of the PSS, but not necessarily with the RMF result. Even though it is too early to be conclusive, this result elucidates the significance of the tensor force when discussing the PSS.</description>

      <title>Volume effect on the extraction of sound velocity in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the speed of sound in quark-gluon plasma is a crucial aspect of understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this study, we investigate the impact of initial-state fluctuations on the extraction of the speed of sound in a quark-gluon plasma in the ultra-central collisions. By employing the TRENTo model for simulating initial conditions, we demonstrate that these fluctuations lead to sizable volume effect, which in turn corrects the measured values of the sound velocity. With respect to realistic conditions of high-energy heavy-ion experiments, we provide quantitative estimate of these corrections.</description>

      <title>Surface and curvature tensions of cold dense quark matter: a term-by-term analysis within the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation of the surface and curvature tensions, $\sigma$ and $\gamma$, of three-flavor cold quark matter using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with vector interactions. Our approach ensures both local and global electric charge neutrality, as well as chemical equilibrium under weak interactions. By employing the multiple reflection expansion formalism to account for finite size effects, we explore the impact of specific input parameters, particularly the vector coupling constant ratio $\eta_V$, the radius $R$ of quark matter droplets, as well as charge-per-baryon ratio $\xi$ of the finite size configurations. We focus on the role of the contributions of each term of the NJL Lagrangian to the surface and curvature tensions in the mean field approximation. We find that the total surface tension exhibits two different density regimes: it remains roughly constant at around $100 \, \mathrm{MeV \, fm^{-2}}$ up to approximately $2-4$ times the nuclear saturation density, and beyond this point, it becomes a steeply increasing function of $n_B$. The total surface and curvature tensions are relatively insensitive to variations in $R$ but are affected by changes in $\xi$ and $\eta_V$. We observe that the largest contribution to $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ comes from the regularized divergent term, making these quantities significantly higher than those obtained within the MIT bag model.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole ${\gamma}$-ray strength functions in the crossover from spherical to deformed neodymium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the magnetic dipole $\gamma$-ray strength functions in a chain of even-mass neodymium isotopes $^{144-152}$Nd in the framework of the configuration-interaction (CI) shell model. We infer the strength function by applying the maximum entropy method (MEM) to the exact imaginary-time response function calculated with the shell-model Monte Carlo (SMMC) method. The success of the MEM depends on the choice of a good strength function as a prior distribution. We investigate two choices for the prior strength function: the static path approximation (SPA) and the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA). We find that the QRPA is a better approximation at low temperatures (i.e., near the ground state), while the SPA is a better choice at finite temperatures. We identify a low-energy enhancement (LEE) in the MEM deexcitation $M1$ strength functions of the even-mass neodymium isotopes and compare with recent experimental results for the total deexcitation $\gamma$-ray strength functions. The LEE is already seen in the SPA strength function but not in the QRPA strength function, indicating the importance of large-amplitude static fluctuations around the mean field in reproducing the LEE. Our method is currently the only one which can reproduce LEE in heavy open-shell nuclei where conventional CI shell model calculations are prohibited. With the onset of deformation as number of neutrons increases along the chain of neodymium isotopes, we observe that some of the LEE strength transfers to a low-energy excitation, which we interpret as a finite-temperature "scissors" mode. We also observe a finite-temperature spin-flip mode.</description>

      <title>Gluon to $q\bar q$ antenna in anisotropic QCD matter: spin-polarized and azimuthal jet observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the production of a quark-antiquark antenna in the presence of a dense and anisotropic QCD medium. We assume the antenna to originate from an unpolarized gluon state, and consider both massless and massive final states. The medium anisotropy is captured by allowing the jet quenching coefficient to take different magnitudes in orthogonal directions with respect to the jet axis. We find that the final particle distribution is sensitive to the medium anisotropy, and more importantly, that this effect couples directly to the helicity/spin of the final states. We propose to look into these effects by performing a Fourier decomposition of the particle distribution inside the jet. In our medium model, we find that the spin independent terms contribute to the even harmonics of the cosine series. The helicity/spin dependence enters only through the sine Fourier series. We further explore the spin dependence by examining the degree of polarization of the final states in different directions. Our results indicate that the anisotropies present in the QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions can be probed by studying azimuthal and spin observables inside jets.</description>

      <title>QCD Masterclass Lectures on Jet Physics and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures were presented at the 2024 QCD Masterclass in Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, France. They introduce and review fundamental theorems and principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle physics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination. Numerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in detail, including $H\to b\bar b$ identification in fixed-order perturbation theory, generic one- versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power counting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming the central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment expansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet discrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive, infrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to including measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented here are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being a parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon discrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are simultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.</description>

      <title>Impact of finite volume on kaon, antikaon, and $\phi$ meson masses and decay width in asymmetric strange hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the impact of finite volume on the in-medium properties of kaons ($K^+$, $K^0$) and antikaons ($K^-$, $\bar{K^0}$), and $\phi$ mesons in the isospin asymmetric strange hadronic medium at finite density and temperature. We use the chiral SU(3) hadronic mean-field model, which accounts for the interactions between baryons through the exchange of scalar ($\sigma, \zeta, \delta $) and vector ($\omega$, $\rho$, $\phi$) fields. To investigate the effects of finite volume, we apply the multiple reflection expansion (MRE) technique for calculations of the density of states. The non-strange scalar field $\sigma$ shows significant variation in an asymmetric medium, while the strange scalar field $\zeta$ shows good dependency in the strange medium. We use the medium-modified masses of kaons and antikaons calculated using the chiral SU(3) model to obtain the masses and decay width of $\phi$ mesons in finite volume hadronic medium. To obtain the masses and decay widths of $\phi$ mesons, an effective Lagrangian approach with $\phi$$K$$\bar{K}$ interactions at one-loop level is used in the present work. We obtain the effective masses and decay widths in the finite volume matter, for the spherical geometry of the medium with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions as well as for the cubic geometry. The finite volume effects are found to be appreciable at high baryon densities.</description>

      <title>Pion photo-production of nucleon excited states with Hamiltonian effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine our previous calculation of multipole amplitude $E_{0+}$ for pion photo-production process, $\gamma N\rightarrow\pi N$. The treatment of final state interactions is based upon an earlier analysis of pion-nucleon scattering within Hamiltonian effective field theory, supplemented by incorporating contributions from the $N^*(1650)$ and the $K\Lambda$ coupled channel. The contribution from the bare state corresponding to the $N^*(1650)$ significantly enhances our results. Additionally, we also compute the multipole amplitude $M_{1-}$, which is of direct relevance to the Roper resonance. The results are comparable with other dynamical coupled channel models, even though the contribution from the bare state (interpreted as a 2s excitation) in this channel is small because of its large mass.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of the anticharmed-strange pentaquark states: mass spectra, decays, and magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the quark delocalization color screening model, a systematic investigation of the anticharmed-strange pentaquark system is performed using the resonance group method. The currently estimations predict three bound states with estimated masses to be 2886 MeV, 3039 MeV, and 3153 MeV, respectively. Additionally, three resonance states are identified in various scattering phase shifts processes. Among them, two resonance states $\Sigma D$ and $\Sigma^{\ast}D^{\ast}$ with quantum number $\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}^{-})$ are detected in channels $ND_{s}^{\ast}$ and $ND$, and $\Sigma D^{\ast}$ and $\Lambda D$, with masses and decay widths of ($M_{R}=3053\sim3055$ MeV, $T_{total}=13.0\sim13.4$ MeV) and ($M_{R}=3389\sim3390$ MeV, $T_{total}=10.4$ MeV), respectively. In the $\Lambda D^{\ast}$ and $\Sigma D^{\ast}$ channels, a resonance state with quantum number $\frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^{-})$ is discovered, with its mass and decay width being $3250\sim3252$ MeV and 4.4 MeV, respectively. These predicted pentaquark states have $\bar{c}snnn$ quark compositions, allowing them to be recognized as genuine pentaquark states. To validate these predictions, it is expected that upcoming experiments will further explore the predicted resonance and bound states in these possible decay channels.</description>

      <title>Effect of ground-state deformation on the Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance and the first observation of overtones of the Isoscalar Giant Quadrupole Resonance in rare-earth Nd isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strength distributions of the Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance (ISGMR) and Isoscalar Giant Quadrupole Resonance (ISGQR) in 142,146-150Nd have been determined via inelastic alpha-particle scattering with the Grand Raiden (GR) Spectrometer at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Japan. In the deformed nuclei 146-150Nd, the ISGMR strength distributions exhibit a splitting into two components, while the nearly spherical nucleus 142Nd displays a single peak in the ISGMR strength distribution. A noteworthy achievement in this study is the first-time detection of overtones in the Isoscalar Giant Quadrupole Resonance (ISGQR) strength distributions within Nd isotopes at an excitation energy around 25 MeV obtained through Multipole Decomposition Analysis (MDA).</description>

      <title>Confirming the molecule explain for the $\Xi(2030)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its discovery in 1977, the spin-parity of $\Xi(2030)$ has not been fully determined experimentally. The latest Particle Data Group (PDG) listing suggests it may be a baryon with $J=5/2$. Therefore, studying the mass spectrum and decay properties of $\Xi(2030)$ has become a current hot topic to definitively establish its spin-parity. As the three-quark model fails to explain $\Xi(2030)$, we previously proposed it may be a molecule primarily composed of $\bar{K}^{}\Sigma$ with $J^P=5/2^{+}$, based on its mass spectrum study. To verify its molecular state interpretation, this work proposes studying the strong decays of $\Xi(2030)$ assuming it is a $P$-wave $J^P=5/2^{+}$ meson-baryon molecule predominantly composed of $\bar{K}^{}\Sigma$. We calculated all experimentally measured two-body and three-body final state decay widths of $\Xi(2030)$, including $\Xi(2030) \to \bar{K}\Lambda, \bar{K}\Sigma, \pi\Xi, \pi\Xi^{*}$, and $\Xi(2030) \to \pi\pi\Xi, \pi\bar{K}\Sigma, \pi\bar{K}\Lambda$. The results indicate that both the total decay width and partial decay widths agree well with experimental values within the error margins. This supports that $\Xi(2030)$ is a molecule with spin-parity $J^P = 5/2^{+}$, predominantly composed of $\bar{K}^{*}\Sigma$. Compared to the experimental central values, our results are slightly smaller, which suggests that $\Xi(2030)$ may contain additional components besides meson-baryon molecular components, such as three quark structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated light nuclei pair photoproduction in relativistic heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions. As a first attempt, we employ our previously developed quantum electrodynamics model, which incorporates a wave-packet description of initial nuclei, to compute the cross section for proton-antiproton pair photoproduction. The effective vertex for the photon and proton interaction is chosen based on studies of two-photon exchange effects in hadron physics. We present the transverse momentum, invariant mass, and azimuthal angle distributions of proton-antiproton pairs at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV in Au+Au ultraperipheral collisions. We observe a $\cos(2\phi)$ modulation and an almost negligible $\cos(4\phi)$ modulation in the azimuthal angle distribution. Our studies helps us better understand the matter generated by light.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel treatment of $^7\mathrm{Li}(n,\gamma)^8\mathrm{Li}$ in effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.09324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The E1 contribution to the capture reaction $^7\mathrm{Li}(n,\gamma)^8\mathrm{Li}$ is calculated at low energies. We employ a coupled-channel formalism to account for the $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ excited core contribution. We develop a halo effective field theory power counting where capture in the spin $S=2$ channel is enhanced over the $S=1$ channel. A next-to-leading order calculation is presented where the excited core contribution is shown to affect only the overall normalization of the cross section. The momentum dependence of the capture cross section, as a consequence, is the same in a theory with or without the excited $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ degree of freedom at this order of the calculation. The kinematical signature of the $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ core is negligible at momenta below 1 MeV and significant only beyond the $3^+$ resonance energy, though still compatible with a next-to-next-to-leading order correction. We compare our formalism with a previous halo effective field theory calculation [Zhang, Nollett, and Phillips, Phys. Rev. C 89, 024613 (2014)] that also treated the $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ core as an explicit degree of freedom. Our formal expressions and analysis disagree with this earlier work in several aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.13003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The E1 and M1 contributions to $^7\mathrm{Be}(p,\gamma)^8\mathrm{B}$ at low energies are calculated in halo effective field theory. The excited $^7\mathrm{Be}^\star$ core is included as an explicit degree of freedom in a coupled-channels calculation. The E1 transition is calculated up to next-to-next-to-leading order. The leading contribution from M1 transition that gives significant contribution in a narrow energy region around the $1^+$ resonance state of $^8$B is included. We compare our results with previous halo effective field theory calculations that also included the $^7\mathrm{Be}^\star$ as an explicit degree of freedom. We disagree with these previous calculations in both the formal expressions and also in the analysis. Bayesian inference of the data gives $S_{17}(0)=21.0(7)$ eV b when combined with the expected theory error.</description>

      <title>Structure Factors for Hot Neutron Matter from Ab Initio Lattice Simulations with High-Fidelity Chiral Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first ab initio lattice calculations of spin and density correlations in hot neutron matter using high-fidelity interactions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) in chiral effective field theory. These correlations have a large impact on neutrino heating and shock revival in core-collapse supernovae and are encapsulated in functions called structure factors. Unfortunately, calculations of structure factors using high-fidelity chiral interactions were well out of reach using existing computational methods. In this work, we solve the problem using a computational approach called the rank-one operator (RO) method. The RO method is a general technique with broad applications to simulations of fermionic many-body systems. It solves the problem of exponential scaling of computational effort when using perturbation theory for higher-body operators and higher-order corrections. Using the RO method, we compute the vector and axial static structure factors for hot neutron matter as a function of temperature and density. The ab initio lattice results are in good agreement with virial expansion calculations at low densities but are more reliable at higher densities. Random phase approximation codes used to estimate neutrino opacity in core-collapse supernovae simulations can now be calibrated with ab initio lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>System size and shape dependences of collective flow fluctuations in relativistic nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations plays an essential role in forming the collective flow of hadrons observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Event-by-event fluctuations of the collective flow can arise from various sources, such as the fluctuations in the initial geometry, hydrodynamic expansion, hadronization, and hadronic evolution of the nuclear matter, while the exact contribution from each source is still an open question. Using a (3+1)-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic model coupled to a Monte-Carlo Glauber initial condition, Cooper-Frye particlization and a hadronic transport model, we explore the system size and shape dependences of the collective flow fluctuations in Au+Au, Cu+Au, and O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$~GeV. The particle yields, mean transverse momenta, 2-particle and 4-particle cumulant elliptic flows ($v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$) from our calculation agree with the currently existing data from RHIC. Different centrality dependences of the flow fluctuations, quantified by the $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ ratio, are found for different collision systems due to their different sizes and shapes. By comparing $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ between different hadron species, and comparing $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ to the initial state geometric fluctuations quantified by the cumulant eccentricity ratio $\varepsilon_2\{4\}/\varepsilon_2\{2\}$, we find that while the initial state fluctuations are the main source of the $v_2$ fluctuations in large collision systems, other sources like nonlinear hydrodynamic response, hadronization, and hadronic afterburner can significantly affect the $v_2$ fluctuations in small systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic beams of heavy ions interacting with various nuclear targets allow to study a broad range of problems starting from nuclear equation of state to the traditional nuclear structure. Some questions which were impossible to answer heretofore -- can be addressed nowadays by using inverse kinematics. These includes the structure of short-lived nuclei and the precision study of exclusive channels with production of residual nuclei in certain quantum states. Theoretical understanding such processes is so far based on factorization models which combine the single-step amplitude of the reaction on a bound nucleon or nuclear cluster with a certain wave function of its relative motion with respect to the residual nucleus. The nuclear structure information is encoded in the spectroscopic amplitude, calculable within nuclear many-body theories. In this work, we use for this purpose the translationally-invariant shell model with configuration mixing and demonstrate that it successfully reproduces the single-differential and integrated cross sections of the quasielastic proton knockout, $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2p)^{11}\mbox{B}$, with outgoing $^{11}$B in the ground state and low-lying excited states measured at GSI at 400 MeV/nucleon.</description>

      <title>Parameter dependence of the $\beta$-decay properties of neutron-rich Zr isotopes within the interacting boson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate parameter dependence of the calculated $\beta$-decay properties, as well as low-lying states for the neutron-rich Zr isotopes within the neutron-proton interacting boson model (IBM-2) and interacting boson-fermion-fermion model (IBFFM-2). It is shown that the calculated $\log_{10}ft$ values for the transitions of the $0^+_1$ ground states of the parent even-even nuclei $^{96-102}$Zr into the $1^+_1$ states of the daughter odd-odd nuclei $^{96-102}$Nb consistently exhibit a strong dependence on those parameters associated with the quadrupole-quadrupole boson interaction, and with the residual interaction between an unpaired neutron and an unpaired proton in the IBFFM-2 Hamiltonian for the odd-odd Nb nuclei. By the reduction in magnitude of the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strength by approximately a factor of 2, the calculated $\log_{10}ft$ values for the Zr$(0^+_1)\to$Nb$(1^+_1)$ transitions increase and agree with the experimental values. This points to a significant improvement over the previous study performed in the same mass region, that consists of the mapping from a relativistic energy density functional calculation onto the IBM-2 Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: At the earliest stage of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the produced matter is a highly populated system of gluons called glasma which can be approximately described in terms of classical chromodynamic fields. Although the system's dynamics is governed by Yang-Mills equations, glasma evolution is shown to strongly resemble hydrodynamic behaviour.</description>

      <title>The spin alignment of vector mesons with light front quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global spin alignment of the vector meson has been observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions, but is still on hot debates in the theoretical community. Here we propose to apply the light front framework to explain this phenomenon since the light front form explicitly describes the hadron spin including both the quark spin and the orbital angular momentum. After applying the light front spinor, we find that the spin alignment in the polarization of vector mesons with $\rho_{00}&gt;1/3$ can be naturally manifested and in particular, the obtained spin alignment for $\phi$ meson is in good agreement with the experimental data. This implies that to explain the spin alignment it is important to properly include the contribution from the gluon interactions that are presented in terms of the orbital angular momentum of the hadron bound state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients of a weakly magnetized hot QCD medium having a weak momentum anisotropy within the kinetic theory approach. The thermal medium effects have been incorporated in the framework of a quasi-particle model where the medium dependent mass of the quark has been calculated using perturbative thermal QCD in the presence of a weak magnetic field which leads to different masses for the left ($L$) and right ($R$) handed chiral quark modes. We have found that the Seebeck and Nernst coefficient magnitudes for the individual quark flavors as well as for the composite medium are decreasing functions of temperature and decreasing functions of anisotropy strength. The Nernst coefficient magnitudes are about an order of magnitude smaller than their Seebeck counterparts, indicating the Seebeck effect constitutes a stronger response than the Nernst effect. The average percentage change corresponding to switching between quasiparticle modes ($L\to R$ or $R\to L$) is an order of magnitude smaller for Nernst coefficients, compared to the Seebeck coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a method to reconstruct full rapidity distributions of charged particle multiplicity and net proton yields, crucial for constraining the longitudinal dynamics of nuclear matter created in the beam energy scan program. Employing rapidity distributions within a multistage hydrodynamic model calibrated for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=7.7-200\,$GeV, we estimate the total energy and baryon number deposited into the collision fireball, offering insights into initial dynamics and the identification of nuclear remnants. We explore the potential of rapidity-dependent measurements in probing equations of state at finite chemical potentials. Furthermore, we compare the freeze-out parameters derived from both hydrodynamics and thermal models, highlighting that the parameters extracted via thermal models represent averaged properties across rapidities.</description>

Abstract: Strongly-interacting dark matter can be accumulated in large quantities inside the Earth, and for dark matter particles in a few GeV mass range, it can exist in large quantities near the Earth's surface. We investigate the constraints imposed on such dark matter properties by its upscattering by fast neutrons in nuclear reactors with subsequent scattering in nearby well-shielded dark matter detectors, schemes which are already used for searches of the coherent reactor neutrino scattering. We find that the existing experiments cover new parameter space on the spin-dependent interaction between dark matter and the nucleon. Similar experiments performed with research reactors, and lesser amount of shielding, may provide additional sensitivity to strongly-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forty years ago, Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit both the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe and the many phenomenological implications of their existence. Most of the paper discusses the limits on their mass distribution and a possible and simple scheme for their production. Finally, we discuss the most promising techniques to detect this type of objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong CP violation problem has a long history emanating from its discovery 60 years ago in the decay of neutral kaons and subsequent experimental and theoretical studies over several decades. We review herein experimental data that observe indirect CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-3}$, as well as the discovery of direct CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-6}$. Despite improved experimental methods over the past half a century, the original CP violation numbers have remained the same. Verification of the CP violation in the decay of charged kaons was also observed. Data reflecting CP violation in the decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons have become very important and are also discussed in this review. The question of CP violation only with the participation of $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, and $b\bar{b}$ quarks in the framework of the Standard Model or beyond it and its small magnitude remains open.</description>

Abstract: Generalized thermodynamic relations are introduced into the framework of a relativistic perfect spin hydrodynamics. They allow for consistent treatment of spin degrees of freedom, including the use of spin tensors whose structure follows from microscopic calculations. The obtained results are important for establishing consistency between different formulations of spin hydrodynamics and form the basis for introducing dissipative corrections.</description>

Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>
