      <title>Bifurcation analysis of multiple limit cycles created in boundary equilibrium bifurcations in hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A boundary equilibrium bifurcation (BEB) in a hybrid dynamical system occurs when a regular equilibrium collides with a switching surface in phase space. This causes a transition to a pseudo-equilibrium embedded within the switching surface, but limit cycles (LCs) and other invariant sets can also be created and the nature of these is not well understood for systems with more than two dimensions. This work treats two codimension-two scenarios in hybrid systems of any number of dimensions, where the number of small-amplitude limit cycles bifurcating from a BEB changes. The first scenario involves a limit cycle (LC) with a Floquet multiplier $1$ and for nearby parameter values the BEB creates a pair of limit cycles. The second scenario involves a limit cycle with a Floquet multiplier $-1$ and for nearby parameter values the BEB creates a period-doubled solution. Both scenarios are unfolded in a general setting, showing that typical two-parameter bifurcation diagrams have a curve of saddle-node or period-doubling bifurcations emanating transversally from a curve of BEBs at the codimension-two point. The results are illustrated with three-dimensional examples and an eight-dimensional airfoil model. Detailed computational results show excellent agreement to the unfolding theory and reveal further interesting dynamical features that remain to be explored.</description>

      <title>Pointwise ergodic theorems along fractional powers of primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish pointwise convergence for nonconventional ergodic averages taken along $\lfloor p^c\rfloor$, where $p$ is a prime number and $c\in(1,4/3)$ on $L^r$, $r\in(1,\infty)$. In fact, we consider averages along more general sequences $\lfloor h(p)\rfloor$, where $h$ belongs in a wide class of functions, the so-called $c$-regularly varying functions. We also establish uniform multiparameter oscillation estimates for our ergodic averages and the corresponding multiparameter pointwise ergodic theorem in the spirit of Dunford and Zygmund. A key ingredient of our approach are certain exponential sum estimates, which we also use for establishing a Waring-type result. Assuming that the Riemann zeta function has any zero-free strip upgrades our exponential sum estimates to polynomially saving ones and this makes a conditional result regarding the behavior of our ergodic averages on $L^1$ to not seem entirely out of reach.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability of compact sets in locally compact metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic exposition of Lyapunov stability for compact sets in locally compact metric spaces. We explore foundational concepts, including neighborhoods of compact sets, invariant sets, and the properties of dynamical systems, and establish key results on the relationships between attraction, invariance, and stability. The work explores Lyapunov stability within the context of dynamical systems, highlighting equivalent formulations and related criteria. Central to the exposition is a proof of the fundamental theorem linking Lyapunov functions to the asymptotic stability of compact sets. This expository piece consolidates results from several classical texts to provide a unified and accessible framework for understanding stability in metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of COVID-19 with imperfect vaccine and virus mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the effect of a partially protective vaccine on COVID-19 infection with the original and mutant virus with the help of a deterministic mathematical model developed. The model we developed consists of five compartments and thirteen parameters. The model consists of S (susceptible), V (vaccinated), I_1 (infected with original virus), I_2 (infected with mutant virus) and R (recover) subcompartments. With the established model, imperfect vaccines and mutant virus for the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey were examined. We examined the effect of both artificial active immunity (vaccinated) and natural active immunity (passing disease) in the model. Since it is known that the recovery and death rates of the original virus and the mutant virus are different in COVID-19, we considered it in the study. We performed local stability and global stability analysis by calculating the disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point of the model. We also obtained the basic reproduction number with the help of the next generation matrix method. We estimated three model parameters with parameter estimation and identified model-sensitive parameters with local sensitivity analysis. Next, we showed the existence of a backward bifurcation using the Castillo-Chavez and Song Bifurcation Theorem. Additionally, to illustrate the underlying fundamental mechanisms of the model dynamics and to support the analytical findings, we presented three distinct simulations.</description>

      <title>Furstenberg counterexamples over Diophantine rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct cocycles in $\mathbb{T} \times SU(2)$ over Diophantine rotations that are minimal and not uniquely ergodic. Such cocycles are dense in an open subset of cocycles over the fixed Diophantine rotation. By a standard argument, they are dense in the whole set of such cocycles if the rotation satisfies a full-measure arithmetic condition.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of multidimensional compact almost automorphic functions and applications to Poissons and heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be a non-empty subset of the Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^m\) (\(m \geq 1\)). This work is dedicated to further exploring the properties of \(\mathcal{G}\)-multi-almost automorphic functions defined on \(\mathbb{R}^m\) with values in a Banach space \(\mathbb{X}\). Using the theory of \(\mathcal{G}\)-multi-almost automorphic functions, we provide two new characterizations of compact almost automorphic functions. In the first characterization, \(\mathcal{G}\) corresponds to the lattice subgroup \(\mathbb{Z}^m \subset \mathbb{R}^m\); in the second, \(\mathcal{G}\) is taken to be a dense subset of \(\mathbb{R}^m\). Furthermore, we establish the invariance of the space of bounded and compactly \(\mathcal{G}\)-multi-almost automorphic functions under integral operators with Bi-almost automorphic kernels. Finally, we present applications to the analysis of the almost automorphic dynamics of Poisson's equation and the heat equation.</description>

      <title>A dynamical study of Hilda asteroids in the Circular and Elliptic RTBP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hilda group is a set of asteroids whose mean motion is in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. In this paper we use the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP) as a dynamical model and we show that there exists a family of stable periodic orbits that are surrounded by islands of quasi-periodic motions. We have computed the frequencies of these quasi-periodic motions and we have shown how the Hilda family fits inside these islands. We have compared these results with the ones obtained using the Elliptic Restricted Three-Body Problem and they are similar, showing the suitability of the CRTBP model. It turns out that, to decide if a given asteroid belongs to the Hilda class, it is much better to look at its frequencies in the planar CRTBP rather than to use two-body orbital elements as it is commonly done today.</description>

      <title>On matrix Lax representations and constructions of Miura-type transformations for differential-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01474v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is part of a research project on relations between differential-difference matrix Lax representations (MLRs) with the action of gauge transformations and discrete Miura-type transformations (MTs) for (nonlinear) integrable differential-difference equations.
  The paper addresses the following problem:
  when and how can one eliminate some shifts of dependent variables from the discrete (difference) part of an MLR by means of gauge transformations?
  Using results on this problem, we present applications to constructing new MLRs and new integrable equations connected by new MTs to known equations.
  In particular, we obtain results of this kind for equations connected to the following ones:
  - The two-component Belov--Chaltikian lattice.
  - The equation (introduced by G. Mari Beffa and Jing Ping Wang) which describes the evolution induced on invariants by an invariant evolution of planar polygons.
  - An equation from [S. Igonin, arXiv:2405.08579] related to the Toda lattice in the Flaschka--Manakov coordinates.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum III: Precessing Quadrupole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very long-term evolution of the hierarchical restricted three-body problem with a slightly aligned precessing quadrupole potential is investigated analytically and solved for both rotating and librating Kozai-Lidov cycles (KLCs) with high eccentricities. We describe the finding of a striking similarity between librating and rotating KLCs for some range of precession rates. We show that the main effect occurs in both categories when the KLC frequency is equal to the precession rate of the perturbing potential. We solve the resonant dynamics analytically and show that it is equivalent to a simple pendulum model allowing us to map the strikingly rich structures that arise for precession rates similar to the Kozai-Lidov timescale (ratio of a few) and explain the similarity and when it vanishes. Additionally, we show that the regular KLCs at high eccentricities can also be described using a simple pendulum.</description>

Abstract: Let phi be a pseudo-Anosov flow on a closed oriented atoroidal 3-manifold M. We show that if F is any taut foliation almost transverse to phi, then the action of pi_1(M) on the boundary of the flow space, together with a natural collection of explicitly described monotone maps, defines a universal circle for F in the sense of Thurston and Calegari-Dunfield.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that measure-class-preserving non-amenable treeable equivalence relations of type III, meaning not preserving any equivalent $\sigma$-finite measure, are induced by free actions of non-abelian free groups of any given number of generators, including infinitely generated free groups, with the additional property that no ends of the induced Schreier graph are vanishing. This is done using a characterization of type III due to Hopf for transformations and Dang-Ngoc-Nghiem in general. This highlights the difference between the type III setting and the measure-preserving setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies ergodic properties of certain measures arising in the dynamics of holomorphic correspondences. These measures, in general, are not invariant in the classical sense of ergodic theory. We define a notion of ergodicity, and prove a version of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem in this setting. We also show the existence of ergodic measures when a holomorphic correspondence is defined on a compact complex manifold. Lastly, we give an explicit class of dynamically interesting measures that are ergodic as in our definition.</description>

      <title>Collective rhythm design in coupled mixed-feedback systems through dominance and bifurcations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of mixed-feedback systems provides an effective framework for the design of robust and tunable oscillations in nonlinear systems characterized by interleaved fast positive and slow negative feedback loops. The goal of this paper is to extend the mixed-feedback oscillation design framework to networks. To this aim, we introduce a network model of coupled mixed-feedback systems, ask under which conditions it exhibits a collective oscillatory rhythm, and if, and how, this rhythm can be shaped by network design. In the proposed network model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of the mixed-feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear network rhythms.</description>

      <title>Formulating human risk response in epidemic models: exogenous vs endogenous approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent pandemic emphasized the need to consider the role of human behavior in shaping epidemic dynamics. In particular, it is necessary to extend beyond the classical epidemiological structures to fully capture the interplay between the spread of disease and how people respond. Here, we focus on the challenge of incorporating change in human behavior in the form of "risk response" into compartmental epidemiological models, where humans adapt their actions in response to their perceived risk of becoming infected. The review examines 37 papers containing over 40 compartmental models, categorizing them into two fundamentally distinct classes: exogenous and endogenous approaches to modeling risk response. While in exogenous approaches, human behavior is often included using different fixed parameter values for certain time periods, endogenous approaches seek for a mechanism internal to the model to explain changes in human behavior as a function of the state of disease. We further discuss two different formulations within endogenous models as implicit versus explicit representation of information diffusion. This analysis provides insights for modelers in selecting an appropriate framework for epidemic modeling.</description>

      <title>The multilinear circle method and a question of Bergelson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k\in \mathbb Z_+$ and $(X, \mathcal B(X), \mu)$ be a probability space equipped with a family of commuting invertible measure-preserving transformations $T_1,\ldots, T_k \colon X\to X$. Let $P_1,\ldots, P_k\in\mathbb Z[\rm n]$ be polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct degrees. We establish pointwise almost everywhere convergence of the multilinear polynomial ergodic averages \[A_{N; X, T_1,\ldots, T_k}^{P_1,\ldots, P_k}(f_1,\ldots, f_k)(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf_1\big(T_1^{P_1(n)}x\big)\cdots f_k\big(T_k^{P_k(n)}x\big), \qquad x\in X, \]
  as $N\to\infty$ for any functions $f_1, \ldots, f_k\in L^{\infty}(X)$. Besides a couple of results in the bilinear setting (when $k=2$ and then only for single transformations), this is the first pointwise result for general polynomial multilinear ergodic averages in arbitrary measure-preserving systems. This answers a question of Bergelson from 1996 in the affirmative for any polynomials with distinct degrees, and makes progress on the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture.
  In this paper, we build a versatile multilinear circle method by developing the Ionescu-Wainger multiplier theorem for the set of canonical fractions, which gives a positive answer to a question of Ionescu and Wainger from 2005. We also establish sharp multilinear $L^p$-improving bounds and an inverse theorem in higher order Fourier analysis for averages over polynomial corner configurations, which we use to establish a multilinear analogue of Weyl's inequality and its real counterpart, a Sobolev smoothing inequality.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the set of zero-noise limits measures of perturbed cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We add small random perturbations to a cellular automaton and consider the one-parameter family $(F_\epsilon)_{\epsilon&gt;0}$ parameterized by $\epsilon$ where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the level of noise. The objective of the article is to study the set of limiting invariant distributions as $\epsilon$ tends to zero denoted $\mathcal{M}_0^l$. Some topological obstructions appear, $\mathcal{M}_0^l$ is compact and connected, as well as combinatorial obstructions as the set of cellular automata is countable: $\mathcal{M}_0^l$ is $\Pi_3$-computable in general and $\Pi_2$-computable if it is uniformly approached. Reciprocally, for any set of probability measures $\mathcal{K}$ which is compact, connected and $\Pi_2$-computable, we construct a cellular automaton whose perturbations by an uniform noise admit $\mathcal{K}$ as the zero-noise limits measure and this set is uniformly approached. To finish, we study how the set of limiting invariant measures can depend on a bias in the noise. We construct a cellular automaton which realizes any connected compact set (without computable constraints) if the bias is changed for an arbitrary small value. In some sense this cellular automaton is very unstable with respect to the noise.</description>

      <title>Intersection norms on surfaces and Birkhoff cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:1604.06688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every finite collection of curves on a surface, we define an associated (semi-)norm on the first homology group of the surface. The unit ball of the dual norm is the convex hull of its integer points. We give an interpretation of these points in terms of certain coorientations of the original collection of curves. Our main result is a classification statement: when the surface has constant curvature and the curves are geodesics, integer points in the interior of the dual unit ball classify isotopy classes of Birkhoff cross sections for the geodesic flow (on the unit tangent bundle to the surface) whose boundary is the symmetric lift of the collection of geodesics. Birkhoff cross sections in particular yield open-book decompositions of the unit tangent bundle.</description>

      <title>From curves to currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.01550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural real-valued functions of closed curves are known to extend continuously to the larger space of geodesic currents. For instance, the extension of length with respect to a fixed hyperbolic metric was a motivating example for the development of geodesic currents. We give a simple criterion on a curve function that guarantees a continuous extension to geodesic currents. The main condition of our criterion is the smoothing property, which has played a role in the study of systoles of translation lengths for Anosov representations. It is easy to see that our criterion is satisfied for almost all the known examples of continuous functions on geodesic currents, such as non-positively curved lengths or stable lengths for surface groups, while also applying to new examples like extremal length. We use this extension to obtain a new curve counting result for extremal length.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties of disintegration of measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a connection between disintegration of measures and geometric properties of probability spaces. We prove a disintegration theorem, addressing disintegration from the perspective of an optimal transport problem. We look at the disintegration of transport plans, which are used to define and study disintegration maps. Using these objects, we study the regularity and absolute continuity of disintegration of measures. In particular, we exhibit conditions for which the disintegration map is weakly continuous and one can obtain a path of measures given by this map. We show a rigidity condition for the disintegration of measures to be given into absolutely continuous measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an explicit solution to Zariski's moduli problem for plane branches. We compute (in an algorithmic way) the set of K\"{a}hler differentials of an irreducible germ of holomorphic plane curve. We show that there is a basis of this set whose main elements correspond to dicritical foliations. Indeed, we discuss several concepts of generation for the semimodule of values of K\"{a}hler differentials of the curve and provide basis of K\"{a}hler differentials, for every of these concepts, whose geometric properties are described. Moreover, we give an algorithmic construction of the bases.</description>

      <title>A finiteness condition for complex continued fraction algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is desirable that a given continued fraction algorithm is simple in the sense that the possible representations can be characterized in an easy way. In this context the so-called finite range condition plays a prominent role. We show that this condition holds for complex $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-Hurwitz algorithms with parameters $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in\mathbb{Q}^2$. This is equivalent to the existence of certain finite partitions related to these algorithms and lies at the root of explorations into their Diophantine properties. Our result provides a partial answer to a recent question formulated by Lukyanenko and Vandehey.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Dynamics Learning for Stiff Collisional-radiative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a data-driven method to discover the latent space and learn the corresponding latent dynamics for a collisional-radiative (CR) model in radiative plasma simulations. The CR model, consisting of high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), must be solved at each grid point in the configuration space, leading to significant computational costs in plasma simulations. Our method employs a physics-assisted autoencoder to extract a low-dimensional latent representation of the original CR system. A flow map neural network is then used to learn the latent dynamics. Once trained, the reduced surrogate model predicts the entire latent dynamics given only the initial condition by iteratively applying the flow map. The radiative power loss is then reconstructed using a decoder. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture can accurately predict both the full-order CR dynamics and the radiative power loss rate.</description>

      <title>Evolving the Euler rotation axis as a dynamical system, using the Euler vector and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are derived which show how generalized Euler vector representations of the Euler rotation axis and angle for a rigid body evolve in time; the Euler vector is also known as a rotation vector or axis-angle vector. The solutions can exhibit interesting rotational features in this non-abstract, visualizable setting, including spinor-like behavior and quasiperiodicity. The equations are well-behaved at zero, reducing to the simple infinitesimal case there. One of them is equivalent to a known quaternion differential equation. The simple geometric derivation does not depend on Euler's rotation theorem, and yields a proof of Euler's theorem using only infinitesimal motions. With mild regularity conditions on the angular velocity function, there is a continuous evolution of the normalized axis and angle for all time. Dynamical systems properties are discussed, and numerical solutions are used to investigate them when the angular velocity is itself rotating, and the Euler vector trajectory traces out a torus-like shape, with a strobe plot that densely fills in a closed curve.</description>

      <title>Randomized Geodesic Flow on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Gromov's geodesic flow problem on hyperbolic groups $G$, we develop in this paper an analog using random walks. This leads to a notion of a harmonic analog $\Theta$ of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\partial^2 G$. We provide three different but related constructions of $\Theta$: 1) by moving the base-point along a quasigeodesic ray 2) by moving the base-point along random walk trajectories 3) directly as a push-forward under the boundary map to $\partial^2 G$ of a measure inherited from studying all bi-infinite random walk trajectories (with no restriction on base-point) on $G^{\mathbb{Z}}$.
  Of these, the third construction is the most involved and needs new techniques. It relies on developing a framework where we can treat bi-infinite random walk trajectories as analogs of bi-infinite geodesics on complete simply connected negatively curved manifolds. Geodesic flow on a hyperbolic group is typically not well-defined due to non-uniqueness of geodesics. We circumvent this problem in the random walk setup by considering \emph{all} trajectories. We thus get a well-defined \emph{discrete flow} given by the $\mathbb{Z}-$shift on bi-infinite random walk trajectories. The $\mathbb{Z}-$shift is the random analog of the time one map of the geodesic flow. As an analog of ergodicity of the geodesic flow on a closed negatively curved manifold, we establish ergodicity of the $G$-action on $(\partial^2G, \Theta)$.</description>
