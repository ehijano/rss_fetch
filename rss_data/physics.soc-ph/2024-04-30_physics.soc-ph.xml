      <title>The Impact of COVID-19 on Co-authorship and Economics Scholars' Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional academic collaboration patterns, prompting a unique opportunity to analyze the influence of peer effects and coauthorship dynamics on research output. Using a novel dataset, this paper endeavors to make a first cut at investigating the role of peer effects on the productivity of economics scholars, measured by the number of publications, in both pre-pandemic and pandemic times. Results show that peer effect is significant for the pre-pandemic time but not for the pandemic time. The findings contribute to our understanding of how research collaboration influences knowledge production and may help guide policies aimed at fostering collaboration and enhancing research productivity in the academic community.</description>

      <title>The transition to synchronization of networked systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the synchronization properties of a generic networked dynamical system, and show that, under a suitable approximation, the transition to synchronization can be predicted with the only help of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. The transition comes out to be made of a well defined sequence of events, each of which corresponds to a specific clustered state. The network's nodes involved in each of the clusters can be identified, and the value of the coupling strength at which the events are taking place can be approximately ascertained. Finally, we present large-scale simulations which show the accuracy of the approximation made, and of our predictions in describing the synchronization transition of both synthetic and real-world large size networks, and we even report that the observed sequence of clusters is preserved in heterogeneous networks made of slightly non-identical systems.</description>

      <title>Note: Harnessing Tellurium Nanoparticles in the Digital Realm Plasmon Resonance, in the Context of Brewster's Angle and the Drude Model for Fake News Adsorption in Incomplete Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note explores the innovative application of soliton theory and plasmonic phenomena in modeling user behavior and engagement within digital health platforms. By introducing the concept of soliton solutions, we present a novel approach to understanding stable patterns of health improvement behaviors over time. Additionally, we delve into the role of tellurium nanoparticles and their plasmonic properties in adsorbing fake news, thereby influencing user interactions and engagement levels. Through a theoretical framework that combines nonlinear dynamics with the unique characteristics of tellurium nanoparticles, we aim to provide new insights into the dynamics of user engagement in digital health environments. Our analysis highlights the potential of soliton theory in capturing the complex, nonlinear dynamics of user behavior, while the application of plasmonic phenomena offers a promising avenue for enhancing the sensitivity and effectiveness of digital health platforms. This research ventures into an uncharted territory where optical phenomena such as Brewster's Angle and Snell's Law, along with the concept of spin solitons, are metaphorically applied to address the challenge of fake news dissemination. By exploring the analogy between light refraction, reflection, and the propagation of information in digital platforms, we unveil a novel perspective on how the 'angle' at which information is presented can significantly affect its acceptance and spread. Additionally, we propose the use of tellurium nanoparticles to manage 'information waves' through mechanisms akin to plasmonic resonance and soliton dynamics. This theoretical exploration aims to bridge the gap between physical sciences and digital communication, offering insights into the development of strategies for mitigating misinformation.</description>

      <title>Plasmon Resonance Model: Investigation of Analysis of Fake News Diffusion Model with Third Mover Intervention Using Soliton Solution in Non-Complete Information Game under Repeated Dilemma Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research note, we propose a new approach to model the fake news diffusion process within the framework of incomplete information games. In particular, we use nonlinear partial differential equations to represent the phenomenon of plasmon resonance, in which the diffusion of fake news is rapidly amplified within a particular social group or communication network, and analyze its dynamics through a soliton solution approach. In addition, we consider how first mover, second mover, and third mover strategies interact within this nonlinear system and contribute to the amplification or suppression of fake news diffusion. The model aims to understand the mechanisms of fake news proliferation and provide insights into how to prevent or combat it. By combining concepts from the social sciences and the physical sciences, this study attempts to develop a new theoretical framework for the contemporary problem of fake news.This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Introducing First-Principles Calculations: New Approach to Group Dynamics and Bridging Social Phenomena in TeNP-Chain Based Social Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note considers an innovative interdisciplinary methodology that bridges the gap between the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics applied to the study of materials such as tellurium nanoparticles (TeNPs) and graphene and the complex dynamics of social systems. The basis for this approach lies in the metaphorical parallels drawn between the structural features of TeNPs and graphene and the behavioral patterns of social groups in the face of misinformation. TeNPs exhibit unique properties such as the strengthening of covalent bonds within telluric chains and the disruption of secondary structure leading to the separation of these chains. This is analogous to increased cohesion within social groups and disruption of information flow between different subgroups, respectively. . Similarly, the outstanding properties of graphene, such as high electrical conductivity, strength, and flexibility, provide additional aspects for understanding the resilience and adaptability of social structures in response to external stimuli such as fake news. This research note proposes a novel metaphorical framework for analyzing the spread of fake news within social groups, analogous to the structural features of telluric nanoparticles (TeNPs). We investigate how the strengthening of covalent bonds within TeNPs reflects the strengthening of social cohesion in groups that share common beliefs and values.

      <title>Cumulative Merging Percolation: A long-range percolation process in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Percolation on networks is a common framework to model a wide range of processes, from cascading failures to epidemic spreading. Standard percolation assumes short-range interactions, implying that nodes can merge into clusters only if they are nearest-neighbors. Cumulative Merging Percolation (CMP) is an new percolation process that assumes long-range interactions, such that nodes can merge into clusters even if they are topologically distant. Hence in CMP percolation clusters do not coincide with the topological connected components of the network. Previous work has shown that a specific formulation of CMP features peculiar mechanisms for the formation of the giant cluster, and allows to model different network dynamics such as recurrent epidemic processes. Here we develop a more general formulation of CMP in terms of the functional form of the cluster interaction range, showing an even richer phase transition scenario with competition of different mechanisms resulting in crossover phenomena. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of simple and complex contagion dynamics from weighted belief networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social contagion is a ubiquitous and fundamental process that drives individual and social changes. Although social contagion arises as a result of cognitive processes and biases, the integration of cognitive mechanisms with the theory of social contagion remains an open challenge. In particular, studies on social phenomena usually assume contagion dynamics to be either simple or complex, rather than allowing it to emerge from cognitive mechanisms, despite empirical evidence indicating that a social system can exhibit a spectrum of contagion dynamics -- from simple to complex -- simultaneously. Here, we propose a model of interacting beliefs, from which both simple and complex contagion dynamics can organically arise. Our model also elucidates how a fundamental mechanism of complex contagion -- resistance -- can come about from cognitive mechanisms.</description>

      <title>SIR-RL: Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Policy Control during Epidemiological Outbreaks in Emerging Market and Developing Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted the intricate interplay between public health and economic stability on a global scale. This study proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to optimize health and economic outcomes during pandemics. The framework leverages the SIR model, integrating both lockdown measures (via a stringency index) and vaccination strategies to simulate disease dynamics. The stringency index, indicative of the severity of lockdown measures, influences both the spread of the disease and the economic health of a country. Developing nations, which bear a disproportionate economic burden under stringent lockdowns, are the primary focus of our study. By implementing reinforcement learning, we aim to optimize governmental responses and strike a balance between the competing costs associated with public health and economic stability. This approach also enhances transparency in governmental decision-making by establishing a well-defined reward function for the reinforcement learning agent. In essence, this study introduces an innovative and ethical strategy to navigate the challenge of balancing public health and economic stability amidst infectious disease outbreaks.</description>
